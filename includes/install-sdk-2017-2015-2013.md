## <a name="setupdevenv"></a>Set up the development environment
To start, set up your development environment with Visual Studio and the Azure SDK.

* Visual Studio 2017 includes the Azure SDK. If you're using VS2017, no additional setup is needed for the development environment.
* For Visual Studio 2015, click on the following link to install the [Azure SDK for Visual Studio 2015](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=518003).
* For Visual Studio 2013, click on the following link to install the [Azure SDK for Visual Studio 2013](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=324322).

* If you don't have Visual Studio installed, use the link for [Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/) and Visual Studio will be installed with the Azure SDK.

> [!NOTE]
> Depending on how many of the SDK dependencies you already have on your machine, installing the SDK could take a long time, from several minutes to a half hour or more.
