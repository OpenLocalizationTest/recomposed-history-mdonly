When you use a Microsoft Azure Traffic Manager to load balance traffic to your Azure Web Site, that web site can then be accessed using the **\*.trafficmgr.com** domain name assigned by Azure. Microsoft Azure also allows you to associate a custom domain name, such as www.contoso.com, with your web site.
