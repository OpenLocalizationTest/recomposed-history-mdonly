This is text with a para tag, a table separator, and a URL. Information about automobiles by make and model, including the price, features such as the number of cylinders and MPG, as well as an insurance risk score.<p>The risk score is initially associated with auto price and then adjusted for actual risk in a process known to actuaries as symboling. A value of +3 indicates that the auto is risky, and a value of -3 that it is probably pretty safe.<p>**Usage**: Predict the risk score by features, using regression or multivariate classification. | Schlimmer, J.C.
