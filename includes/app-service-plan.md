An App Service plan specifies the location, size, and features of the web server farm that hosts your app. You can save money when hosting multiple apps by setting them up to share a single App Service plan.

App Service plans define:

* Region (for example: North Europe, East US, and Southeast Asia, etc.)
* Instance Size (Small, Medium, or Large)
* Scale Count (1 to 20 instances)
* SKU (Free, Shared, Basic, Standard, or Premium)
