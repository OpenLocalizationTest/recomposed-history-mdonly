To be able to authenticate users, you must register your app with an identity provider. You must then register the provider-generated client secret with App Services.

1. Log on to the [Azure Management Portal], click **Browse**, and choose **App Service Gateways**.

2. Select your gateway, and make a note of the **Gateway URL** value. You may need to provide this value to the identity provider when you register your app.
