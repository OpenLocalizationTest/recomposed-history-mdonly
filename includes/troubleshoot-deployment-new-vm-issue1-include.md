### Issue 1: Youâ€™re using a custom image, and the audit log indicates either a provisioning timeout or a provisioning failure

Provisioning errors arise if you upload or capture a generalized VM image as a specialized VM image or vice versa. The former will cause a provisioning timeout error and the latter will cause a provisioning failure. To deploy your custom image without errors, you must ensure that the type of the image does not change during the capture process.

The following table lists the possible combinations of generalized and specialized images, the error type you will encounter and what you need to do to fix the errors.
