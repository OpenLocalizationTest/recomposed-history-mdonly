## Connect to Azure SQL Database using SQL Server Authentication

Use the following steps to connect to Azure SQL Database with SSMS using SQL Server Authentication:


1. Start SSMS by typing **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio** in the Windows search box, and then click the desktop app.

2. In the **Connect to Server** window, enter the following information:

 - **Server type**: The default is database engine; do not change this value.
 - **Server name**: Enter the fully qualified name of your Azure SQL Database server in the following format: *&lt;servername>*.**database.windows.net**
 - **Authentication type**: This article shows you how to connect using **SQL Server Authentication**. For details on connecting with Azure Active Directory, see [Connect using Active Directory integrated authentication](../articles/sql-database/sql-database-aad-authentication.md#connect-using-active-directory-integrated-authentication), [Connect using Active Directory password authentication](../articles/sql-database/sql-database-aad-authentication.md#connect-using-active-directory-password-authentication), and [Connect using Active Directory Universal Authentication](../articles/sql-database/sql-database-ssms-mfa-authentication.md).
 - **User name**: Enter the name of a user with access to a database on the server (for example, the *server admin* you set up when creating the Azure SQL server). 
 - **Password**: Enter the password for the specified user (for example, the *password* you set up when creating the server).

3. Click **Connect**.
 
4. By default, new servers have no defined [firewall rules](../articles/sql-database/sql-database-firewall-configure.md) so clients are initially blocked from connecting. If your server does not have a firewall rule that allows your specific IP address to connect, SSMS requests to create a server-level firewall rule for you.

    Click **Sign in** and create a server-level firewall rule. You must be an Azure administrator to create a server-level firewall rule.

5. After successfully connecting to your Azure SQL database, **Object Explorer** opens and you can now access your database to perform administrative tasks or query data.

## Troubleshoot connection failures

The most common reasons for connection failures are mistakes in the server name. Remember, <*servername*> is the name of the server, not the database), and you need to provide the fully qualified server name: `<servername>.database.windows.net`. Also, verify the user name and password do not contain any typos (user names are not case sensitive, but passwords are). 

You can also try specifying the protocol and port number with the server name like the following: `tcp:servername.database.windows.net,1433`

Network connectivity issues can also cause connection errors and timeouts. Simply retrying to connect (when you know that the server name, credentials, and firewall rules are correct) can lead to success.
