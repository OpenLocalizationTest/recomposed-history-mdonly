## Create a connection to SharePoint

In order to connect to **SharePoint Online**, you need to provide your identity (username and password, smart card credentials, etc.) to SharePoint Online. Once you've been authenticated, you can proceed to use the SharePoint Online connector  in your logic app. 

While on the designer of your logic app, follow these steps to sign into SharePoint to create the connection **connection** for use in your logic app:

1. Enter SharePoint in the search box and wait for the search to return all entries with SharePoint in the name:   
![Configure SharePoint][1]  
2. Select **SharePoint Online - When a file is created**   
3. Select **Sign in to SharePoint Online**:   
![Configure SharePoint][2]    
4. Provide your SharePoint credentials to sign in to authenticate with SharePoint   
![Configure SharePoint][3]     
5. After the authentication completes you'll be redirected to your logic app to complete it by configuring SharePoint's **When a file is created** dialog.          
![Configure SharePoint][4]  
6. You can then add other triggers and actions that you need to complete your logic app.   
7. Save your work by selecting **Save** on the menu bar above.
