## Next steps

Try out a virtual machine by creating a simple virtual machine quickly. For instructions, see one of these tutorials:

[Create a virtual machine running Linux](virtual-machines-linux-cli-create.md)

[Create a virtual machine running Windows in the Azure portal](virtual-machines-windows-hero-tutorial.md)

Because those tutorials help you create a virtual machine quickly, they show you only one way to do it instead of describing the various tools you can use to create virtual machines. For a summary of these tools and links to instructions, see:

[Different ways to create a Linux virtual machine](virtual-machines-linux-creation-choices.md)

[Different ways to create a Windows virtual machine](virtual-machines-windows-creation-choices.md)

If you're just starting to learn about Azure virtual machines, be sure to also check out the [Frequently asked questions](virtual-machines-linux-classic-faq.md).
