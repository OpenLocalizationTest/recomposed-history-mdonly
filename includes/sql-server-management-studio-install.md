##Install the newest version of SQL Server Management Studio

  When working with SQL Database, we recommend that you use the most recent version of SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). The newest version of SSMS is optimized for both Azure SQL Database and SQL Server 2016, and works for all supported versions of SQL Server. To download and install the most recent version of SSMS, see [Download SQL Server Management Studio](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt238290.aspx). Install new versions of SSMS to take advantage of all new and updated features. SSMS prompts you when there is a new version available to download. 

  After installing, run the **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio** app:
