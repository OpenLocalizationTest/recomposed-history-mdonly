##Install the newest version of SQL Server Management Studio

  When working with SQL Database, we recommend that you use the most recent version of SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS). The newest version of SSMS is optimized for both Azure SQL Database and SQL Server 2016, and works for all supported versions of SQL Server. To download and install the most recent version of SSMS, see [Download SQL Server Management Studio](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt238290.aspx). SSMS will prompt you when there is a new version available to download, and you should install new versions of SSMS as they are released to take advantage of all new and updated features.

  After installing, run the **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio** app (typically located at: *C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SQL Server\130\Tools\Binn\ManagementStudio\Ssms.exe*)
