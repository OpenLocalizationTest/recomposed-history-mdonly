If you use an Azure subscription where you are not the administrator/owner, such as a company owned subscription, your user account must have at least __Contributor__ access to the subscription. You must also have __Contributor__ access to the Azure Resource Group that the HDInsight cluster will be created in.

For more information on working with access management, see the following documents:
