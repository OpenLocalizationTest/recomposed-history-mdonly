> The [Secure transfer required](../articles/storage/storage-require-secure-transfer.md) feature enforces all requests to your account through a secure connection. This feature is only supported by HDInsight cluster version 3.6 or newer. Currently, you cannot directly create a HDInsight cluster with secure transfer enabled Azure Storage accounts. For more information, see [Create Hadoop cluster with secure transfer storage accounts in Azure HDInsight](../articles/hdinsight-hadoop-create-linux-clusters-with-secure-transfer-storage.md).
