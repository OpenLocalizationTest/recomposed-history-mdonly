The [Secure transfer required](../storage/storage-require-secure-transfer.md) feature enforces all requests to your account through a secure connection. This feature is only supported by HDInsight cluster version 3.6 or newer. Currently, you cannot directly create a HDInsight cluster with a secure transfer enabled Azure Storage account. After you have enabled the feature for the default storage account, you must also use the **Ambari UI** to configure **HDFS>Configs>Advanced>Advance core-site>fs.defaultFS** by replacing **wasb://container@sname.blob.core.windows.net** to **wasbs://container@sname.blob.core.windows.net**.
