Azure Functions Core Tools lets you run Azure Functions project on your local development computer. You are prompted to install these tools the first time you start a function from Visual Studio.  

To test your function, right-click the project node in **Solution Explorer** and select **Debug** > **Start new instance**. If prompted, accept the request from Visual Studio to download and install Azure Functions Core (CLI) tools.  You may also need to enable a firewall exception to enable the tools to handle HTTP requests.
