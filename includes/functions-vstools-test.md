Azure Functions Core Tools lets you run Azure Functions project on your local development computer. You are prompted to install these tools the first time you start a function from Visual Studio.  

To test your function, press F5. If prompted, accept the request from Visual Studio to download and install Azure Functions Core (CLI) tools.  You may also need to enable a firewall exception so that the tools can handle HTTP requests.
