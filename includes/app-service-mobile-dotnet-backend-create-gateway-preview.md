Follow these steps to create a new App Service gateway to handle authentication for your mobile app.

  > [AZURE.NOTE] If you already have a gateway in the same resource group as the  mobile app backend, you do not need to complete this section.

1. Log into the [Azure Portal].

2. Navigate to your mobile app and select **Settings**, and then, under the **Mobile** category, **User authentication**.

3. You will be presented with a blade for creating your gateway. You do not need to enter any information, and the name of this gateway will be generated for you. Click **Create**.

You have now created an App Service gateway that can be used by your mobile app backend. Next, you will configure it to use an authentication provider.
