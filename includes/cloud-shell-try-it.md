The [Azure Cloud Shell](../articles/cloud-shell/quickstart.md) (in public preview) is a web-based shell that is preconfigured to simplify using Azure tools. With Cloud Shell, you always have the most up-to-date version of the tools available and you donâ€™t have to install, update or separately log in. Click the **Try It** button at the top right of an Azure CLI code block to launch the Cloud Shell. Then, use the **Copy** button to copy and paste the sample code into the Cloud Shell.

You can also open the Cloud Shell from the Azure portal by clicking the ![Cloud Shell](./media/cloud-shell-try-it/cs-button.png) button on the menu in the upper-right of the portal.
