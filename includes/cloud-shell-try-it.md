The [Azure Cloud Shell](../articles/cloud-shell/quickstart.md) (in public preview) is a web based shell that is preconfigured to simplify using Azure tools. With Cloud Shell, you always have the most up-to-date version of the tools available and you donâ€™t have to install, update or separately log-in. 

Just click the Cloud Shell button on the top navigation.

Or, click the **Try It** button at the top right of a CLI code block within this article to launch the Cloud Shell.

If you prefer not to use the Cloud Shell please make sure you have installed the latest version of the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) and log in using the **az login** command.
