The Azure Cloud Shell (in public preview) is a web based shell that is preconfigured to simplify using Azure tools. Using Cloud Shell means you always have the most up-to-date version of the tools available and you don’t have to install, update or separately log-in. 

You can access the Cloud Shell from the portal.  Just launch the Cloud Shell from the top navigation.

Or, click the “Try It” button at the top right of a code block to launch it in the Cloud Shell.

To learn more about using Cloud Shell, take a look at the [Cloud Shell quickstart](../aricles/cloud-shell/quickstart.md).

If you prefer not to use the Cloud Shell please make sure you have installed the latest version of the [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) and log in using the **az login** command.
