The [Azure Cloud Shell](../articles/cloud-shell/quickstart.md) (in public preview) is a web-based shell that is preconfigured to simplify using Azure tools. With Cloud Shell, you always have the most up-to-date version of the tools available and you donâ€™t have to install, update or separately log in. You can also open the Cloud Shell from the Azure portal by clicking the ![Cloud Shell](./media/cloud-shell-try-it/cs-button.png) button on the menu in the upper-right of the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, you need to log in to your Azure subscription with the [az login](/cli/azure/#login) command and follow the on-screen directions.
