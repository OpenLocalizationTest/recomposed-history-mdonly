Now that the app has been updated to use Mobile Services for back end storage, you can test it against Mobile Services, using either the Android emulator or an Android phone.

1. From the **Run** menu, click **Run** to start the project.

	This executes your app, built with the Android SDK, that uses the client library to send a query that returns items from your mobile service.

5. As before, type meaningful text, then click **Add**.

   	This sends a new item as an insert to the mobile service.

3. In the [Management Portal], click **Mobile Services**, and then click your mobile service.

4. Click the **Data** tab, then click **Browse**.

   	Notice that the **TodoItem** table now contains data, with some values generated by Mobile Services, and that columns have been automatically added to the table to match the TodoItem class in the app.

This concludes the **Get started with data** tutorial for Android.
