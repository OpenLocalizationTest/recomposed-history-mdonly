Site-to-Site connections to an on-premises network require a VPN device. There are many different VPN devices that will work with Azure. For information about VPN devices and configuration settings, see [VPN Devices](../articles/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpn-devices.md). Before configuring your VPN device, check for any [Known device compatibility issues](../articles/vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-about-vpn-devices.md#known) for the VPN device that you want to use. For specific VPN device configuration information, work with your device manufacturer.

When configuring your VPN device, you will the following items:

- The Public IP address of your virtual network gateway.

	-  To find the Public IP address using the Azure portal,  navigate to **Virtual network gateways**, then click the name of your gateway. 

	- To find the Public IP address of your virtual network gateway using PowerShell, use the following example:

    		Get-AzureRmPublicIpAddress -Name GW1PublicIP -ResourceGroupName TestRG
- A shared key. This is the same shared key that you will specify when creating your Site-to-Site VPN connection. In our examples, we use a very basic shared key. You should generate a more complex key to use.
