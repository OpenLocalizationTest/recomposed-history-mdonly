	This updates the configuration of your mobile service to use the enhanced push notification functionality provided by Notification Hubs. Some Notification Hubs usage is free with your paid mobile service. For more information, see [Mobile Services Pricing Details](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=311786).

    <div class="dev-callout"><b>Important</b>
	<p>This operation resets your push credentials and changes the behavior of the push methods in your scripts. These changes cannot be reverted. Do not use this method to add a notification hub to a production mobile service. For guidance on how to enable enhanced push notifications in a production mobile service, see <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=391951">this guidance</a>.</p>
    </div>
