>[!NOTE]
> [Custom policies](..\articles\active-directory-b2c\active-directory-b2c-overview-custom.md#custom-policies) are designed primarily for identity pros who are addressing complex scenarios. Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) B2C [built-in policies](..\articles\active-directory-b2c\active-directory-b2c-overview-custom.md) are recommended for most scenarios and provide easier configuration. The two configuration approaches (built-in and custom) can coexist in the same Azure AD B2C tenant. Learn more about [built-in and custom policies](..\articles\active-directory-b2c\active-directory-b2c-overview-custom.md).
