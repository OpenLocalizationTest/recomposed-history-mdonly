We have created the concept of the Azure Compute Unit (ACU) to provide a way of comparing compute (CPU) performance across Azure SKUs. This will help you easily identify which SKU is most likely to satisfy your performance needs.  ACU is currently standardized on a Small (Standard_A1) VM being 100 and all other SKUs then represent approximately how much faster that SKU can run a standard benchmark. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The ACU is only a guideline.  The results for your workload may vary.

ACUs marked with a * use IntelÂ® Turbo technology to increase CPU frequency and provide a performance boost.  The amount of the boost can vary based on the VM size, workload, and other workloads running on the same host.
