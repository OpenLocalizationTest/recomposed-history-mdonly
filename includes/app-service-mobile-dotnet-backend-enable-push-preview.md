The server project downloaded from the portal already has push enabled.

The project has done the following for you:

* The `Microsoft.Azure.Mobile.Server.Notifications` NuGet package is installed.

* The MobileAppConfiguration object has its `UseDefaultConfiguration()` method invoked. This in turn calls the `AddPushNotifications()` extension method provided by the above NuGet package.
