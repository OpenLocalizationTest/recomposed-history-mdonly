You can create virtual machines (VMs) in Azure and expose them to the public Internet by using a public IP address (PIP). By default, PIPs are dynamic and the address associated tot hem may change when the VM is deleted. To guarantee that the VM always uses the same public IP address, you need to create a static PIP. 

Before you can implement static PIPs in VMs, it is necessary to understand when you can use static PIPs, and how they are used. Read the [IP addressing overview](virtual-network-ip-addresses-overview-arm.md) to learn more about IP addressing in Azure.
