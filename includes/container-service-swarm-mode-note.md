> [!NOTE]
> The Docker Swarm orchestrator in Azure Container Service uses legacy standalone Swarm. Currently, the integrated [Swarm mode](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/) (in Docker 1.12 and higher) is not a supported orchestrator in Azure Container Service. If you want to deploy a Swarm mode cluster in Azure, use the open-source [ACS-Engine](https://github.com/Azure/acs-engine/blob/master/docs/swarmmode.md), a community-contributed [quickstart template](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/templates/101-acs-swarm/), or a Docker solution in the [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com).
