By default, all requests to mobile service resources are restricted to clients that present the application key, which does not strictly secure access to resources. To secure your resources, you need to restrict access to authenticated clients only.

1. In Visual Studio, open the project that contains your mobile service. 

2. In Solution Explorer, expand the Controllers folder and open the TodoItemController.cs project file.

	The **TodoItemController** class implements data access for the TodoItem table. 

3. Add the following `using` statement at the top of the code page:

		using Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Mobile.Service.Security;

4. To each method in the **TodoItemController** class, apply the following RequiresAuthorization attribute:

		[RequiresAuthorization(AuthorizationLevel.User)]

	This will ensure that all operations against the **TodoItem** table require an authenticated user. 

5. (Optional) Open the web.config file for the mobile service project, locate the Mobile Services keys in appSettings, and set the crendentials that you obtained from your identity provider earlier in the tutorial.

	You only need to do this when you plan to test authentication on your local computer. 
	
	>[WACOM.NOTE]These credentials are only used when your service runs locally. The settings are overwritten with the values that you set in the Management Portal.
