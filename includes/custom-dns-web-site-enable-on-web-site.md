After the records for your domain name have propagated, you must associate them with your web site. Use the following steps to enable the domain names using your web browser.

1. In your browser, open the [Windows Azure Management Portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com).

2. In the **Web Sites** tab, click the name of your site, select **Dashboard**, and then select **Manage Domains** from the bottom of the page.

6. Click the check mark in the lower right corner to save the domain name configuration.

	Once configuration has completed, the custom domain name will be listed in the **domain names** section of the **Configure** page of your web site.

At this point, you should be able to enter the custom domain name in your browser and see that it successfully takes you to your Azure Web Site.
