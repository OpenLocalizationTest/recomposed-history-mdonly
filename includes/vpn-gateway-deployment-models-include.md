It's important to understand that Azure currently works with two deployment models: Resource Manager and classic. Before you begin your configuration, verify that you are using the instructions for the deployment model that you want to work in. The two models are not completely compatible with each other.

For example, if you are working with a virtual network that was created using the classic deployment model, you would use the classic deployment model configuration steps and deployment methods, not the Resource Manager steps and methods. And conversely, you are working with a virtual network that was created using the Resource Manager deployment model, you would use the configuration steps and methods that correspond with Resource Manager, not classic.

For information about the deployment models, see [Understanding Resource Manager deployment and classic deployment](../articles/resource-manager-deployment-model.md).
