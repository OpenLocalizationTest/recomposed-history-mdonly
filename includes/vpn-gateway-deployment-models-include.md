It's important to understand that Azure currently works with two deployment models: Resource Manager and classic. The behavior of some features can differ between the two models. 

To simplify the deployment and management of resources, Microsoft recommends that you use Resource Manager for new resources, and, if possible, redeploy existing resources through Resource Manager. For information about the deployment models, see [Understanding Resource Manager deployment and classic deployment](../articles/resource-manager-deployment-model.md).

Before you begin your configuration, verify that you are using the instructions for the deployment model that you want to work in. For example, if you are working with a virtual network that was created using the classic deployment model, you would use the classic deployment model configuration steps and tools, not the Resource Manager steps and tools. You can't add Resource Manager resources and configure settings for a virtual network that was created using the classic deployment model. The same holds true when working with the Resource Manager deployment model.
