When you add virtual machines (VMs) to a virtual network (VNet) in Azure, you will notice that the VMs are able to communicate with other over the network, automatically. You do not need to specify a gateway, even though the VMs are in different subnets. The same is true for communication from the VMs to the public Internet, and even to your on-premises network when a hybrid connection from Azure to your own datacenter is present. 

This flow of communication is possible because Azure uses a series of system routes to define how IP traffic flows. System routes control the flow of communication in the following scenarios:

- From within the same subnet.
- From a subnet to another within a VNet.
- From VMs to the Internet.
- From a VNet to another VNet through a VPN gateway.
- From a VNet to your on-premises network through a VPN gateway.

Although the use of system routes facilitates traffic automatically for your deployment, there are cases in which you want to control the routing of packets through a virtual appliance. You can do so by creating user defined routes that specify the next hop for packets flowing to a specific subnet to go to your virtual appliance instead, and enabling IP forwarding for the VM running as the virtual appliance.
