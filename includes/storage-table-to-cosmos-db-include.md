Currently in public preview, Azure Table storage is offered as part of [Azure Cosmos DB](../articles/cosmosdb/introduction.md), and supports the following capabilities:

- independent scaling of storage and throughput
- turn-key global distribution
- single-digit millisecond latencies with reads under 10 ms at p99 and writes under 15 ms at p99
- automatic indexing and rich query 
- five tunable consistency levels
- 99.99% availability. 

To learn more, see [Azure Cosmos DB: Tables API](../articles/cosmosdb/tables-introduction.md). Azure Cosmos DB will be extended to support all existing and new tables using the Azure Table storage SDKs and APIs.
