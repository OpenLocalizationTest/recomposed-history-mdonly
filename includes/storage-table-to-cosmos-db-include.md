Currently in public preview, Azure Table storage is offered as part of [Azure Cosmos DB](../articles/cosmosdb/introduction.md), and supports independent scaling of storage and throughput, turn-key global distribution, single-digit millisecond latencies with reads under 10ms at p99 and writes under 15ms at p99, automatic indexing and rich querying, five tunable consistency levels, and 99.99% availabilty. To learn more, see [Azure Cosmos DB: Tables API](../articles/cosmosdb/tables-introduction.md). Azure Cosmos DB will be extended to support all existing and new tables using the Azure Table storage SDKs and APIs.
