#How to Create and Deploy a Website

<div chunk="../../Shared/Chunks/disclaimer.md" />

Just as you can quickly create and deploy a web application created from the gallery, you can also deploy a website created on a workstation with traditional developer tools from Microsoft or other companies.

##<a name="deployawebsite"></a>How to: Deploy a Website from Git


If you use a Git for source code control, you can publish your app directly from a local Git repository to a website. Git is a free, open-source, distributed version control system that handles small to very large projects. To use Git with your website, you must set up Git publishing from the Quick Start or Dashboard management pages for your website. After you set up Git publishing, each .Git push initiates a new deployment. You'll manage your Git deployments on the Deployments management page.

**Tip**  
After you create your website, use **Set up Git Publishing** from the **Quick Start** or **Dashboard** management pages to set up Git publishing for the website. If you're new to Git, you'll be guided through creating a Git account and a local repository for your website. You'll see the exact Git commands that you need to enter, including the Git repository URLs to use with your website.

### Set up Git Publishing ###

1. Create a website in Windows Azure. (**Create New - Web Site**)
2. From the **Quick Start** management page, click **Set up Git publishing**.

Follow the instructions to create a deployment user account by specifying a username and password to use for deploying with Git and FTP, if you havenâ€™t done that already. A Git repository will be created for the website that you are managing.

### Push your local Git repository to Windows Azure ###
The following procedures below will walk you through creating a new repository or cloning an existing repository and then pushing your content to the Git repository for the website.

1. Install the Git client. ([Download Git][getgit])
2. Open a command prompt, change directories to your application's root directory, and type the following commands:
   
		git init
		git add.
		git commit -m "initial commit"

	This creates a local Git repository and commits your local application files to the repository.

3. Add a remote Windows Azure repository and push your files to it.
4. Open a command prompt, cd into your app's root directory and type the following:

  		git remote add azure http://azure@microsoft.com.antdf0.windows-int.net/azureweb.git
		git push azure master
 
	 **Note**
	 The commands above will vary depending upon the name of the website for which you have created the Git repository.
 
### Clone a website to my computer ###
1. Install the Git client. ([Download Git][getgit]) if you have not already.
2. Clone your website.
3. Open a command prompt, change directories to the directory where you want your files, and type:

		git clone -b master GitRepositoryURL
 
	where _GitRepositoryURL_ is the URL for the Git repository that you want to clone.

4. Commit changes, and push the repository's contents back to Windows Azure.

5. After changing or adding some files, change directories your app's root directory and type:

  		git add.
		git commit -m "some changes"
		git push
 
After deployment begins, you can monitor the deployment status on the **Deployments** management page. When the deployment completes, click **Browse** to open your website in a browser.
