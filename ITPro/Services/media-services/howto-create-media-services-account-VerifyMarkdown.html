<h1>How to Create a Media Services Account</h1>

<p>The Windows Azure Management Portal provides a way to quickly create a Windows Azure Media Services account. You can use your account to access Media Services that enable you to store, encrypt, encode, manage, and stream media content in Windows Azure. At the time you create a Media Services account, you also create an associated storage account (or use an existing one) in the same geographic region as the Media Services account. </p>

<p>This topic explains how to use the Quick Create method to create a new Media Services account and then associate it with a storage account. </p>

</ul>

<h2 id="concepts">Concepts</h2>

<p>Accessing Media Services requires two associated accounts:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>A Media Services account</strong>. Your account gives you access to a set of cloud-based Media Services that are available in Windows Azure. A Media Services account does not store actual media content. Instead it stores metadata about the media content and media processing jobs in your account. At the time you create the account, you select an available Media Services region. The region you select is a data center that stores the metadata records for your account. 
<ul>
<li><strong>Note</strong>  Available Media Services regions include the following: <strong>West Europe</strong>, <strong>Southeast Asia</strong>, <strong>East Asia</strong>, <strong>North Europe</strong>, <strong>West US</strong>, <strong>East US</strong>. Media Services does not use affinity groups. </li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>An associated storage account</strong>. Your storage account is a Windows Azure storage account that is associated with your Media Services account. The storage account provides blob storage for media files, and must be located in the same geographic region as the Media Services account. When you create a Media Services account, you can either choose an existing storage account in the same region, or you can create a new storage account in the same region. If you delete a Media Services account, the blobs in your related storage account are not deleted. </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="begin">Before you begin</h2>

<ul>
<li>To activate the Media Services Preview on your Windows Azure subscription, sign into <a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/">WindowsAzure.com</a> with your Azure subscription account, browse to the <strong>Account</strong> page, then click <strong>preview features</strong>. </li>
<li>In the Media Services section click <strong>try it now</strong>. </li>
<li>In the <strong>Add Preview Feature</strong> dialog box, select the subscription you want to use from the drop-down control and click the "check" icon. After the dialog box closes, you will return to the preview features page. The Media Services status should say "Pending." You cannot finish the account setup process until the status for Media Services on the Preview Features page changes to "You Are Active." </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="quick">How to: Create a Media Services account using Quick Create</h2>

<ol>
<li><p>In the <a href="http://manage.windowsazure.com/">Management Portal</a>, click <strong>New</strong>, click <strong>Media Service</strong>, and then click <strong>Quick Create</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="../media/wams-QuickCreate.png" alt="Media Services Quick Create" /></p></li>
<li><p>In <strong>NAME</strong>, enter the name of the new account. A Media Services account name is all lower-case numbers or letters with no spaces, and is 3 - 24 characters in length. </p></li>
<li><p>In <strong>REGION</strong>, select the geographic region that will be used to store the metadata records for your Media Services account. Only the available Media Services regions appear in the dropdown. </p></li>
<li><p>In <strong>STORAGE ACCOUNT</strong>, select a storage account to provide blob storage of the media content from your Media Services account. You can select an existing storage account in the same geographic region as your Media Services account, or you can create a new storage account. A new storage account is created in the same region. </p></li>
<li><p>If you created a new storage account, in <strong>NEW STORAGE ACCOUNT NAME</strong>, enter a name for the storage account. The rules for storage account names are the same as for Media Services accounts.</p></li>
<li><p>Click <strong>Quick Create</strong> at the bottom of the form.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>You can monitor the status of the process in the message area at the bottom of the window.</p>

<p>The <strong>media services</strong> page opens with the new account displayed. When the status changes to Active, it means the account is successfully created.</p>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<p>When you double-click on the account name, the Quick Start page is displayed by default. This page enables you to do some management tasks that are also available on other pages of the portal. For example, you can upload a video file from this page, or do it from the CONTENT page.</p>

<p>In addition, you can view code that uses Windows Azure Media Services SDK to accomplish the following tasks: upload, encode, and publish videos. You can click on one of the links under WRITE SOME CODE section, copy the code  and use it in your application. </p>
