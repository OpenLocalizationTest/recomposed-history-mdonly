<h1>How to Scale a Media Service</h1>

<p><div chunk="../../Shared/Chunks/disclaimer.md" /></p>

<p>You can scale Media Services by specifying the number of <strong>On-Demand Streaming Reserved Units</strong> and <strong>Encoding Reserved Units</strong> that you would like your account to be provisioned with. </p>

<h2>On-Demand Streaming Reserved Units</h2>

<p>On-Demand Streaming reserved units provide you with both dedicated egress capacity that can be purchased in increments of 200 Mbps and  additional functionality which currently includes <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=276874">dynamic packaging capabilities</a>. By default, on-demand streaming is configured in a shared-instance model for which server resources (for example, compute, egress capacity, etc.) are shared with all other users. To improve an on-demand streaming throughput, it is recommended to purchase On-Demand Streaming reserved units. </p>

<p>To change the number of on-demand streaming reserved units, do the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>In the <a href="https://manage.windowsazure.com/">Management Portal</a>, click <strong>Media Services</strong>. Then, click the name of the media service.</p></li>
<li><p>Select the ORIGINS page. Then, click on the origin that you want to modify.</p>

<li><p>To specify the number of reserved units, select the SCALE tab and move the <strong>reserved capacity</strong> slider.</p>

<p><img src="../media/media-services-origin-scale.png" alt="Scale page" /></p></li>
<li><p>Press the SAVE button to save your changes.</p>

<p>The allocation of any new units of on-demand streaming takes around 20 minutes to complete. </p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> Currently, going from any positive value of on-demand streaming units back to none, can disable on-demand streaming for up to an hour.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The highest number of units specified for the 24-hour period is used in calculating the cost. For information about pricing details, see <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=275107">Media Services Pricing Details</a>.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Encoding Reserved Units</h2>

<p>The number of provisioned encoding reserved units is equal to the number of media tasks that can be processed concurrently in a given account. For example, if your account has 5 reserved units, then 5 media tasks will be running concurrently as long as there are tasks to be processed. The remaining tasks will wait in the queue and will get picked up for processing sequentially as soon as a running task finishes. If an account does not have any reserved units provisioned, then tasks will be picked up sequentially. In this case, the wait time between one task finishing and the next one starting will depend on the availability of resources in the system.</p>

<p>To change the number of encoding reserved units, do the following:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>In the <a href="https://manage.windowsazure.com/">Management Portal</a>, click <strong>Media Services</strong>. Then, click the name of the media service.</p></li>
<li><p>Select the PROCESSORS page. </p>

<p><img src="../media/media-services-encoding-scale.png" alt="Processors page" /> </p></li>
<li><p>Press the SAVE button to save your changes.</p>

<p>The new encoding reserved units are allocated almost immediately.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The highest number of units specified for the 24-hour period is used in calculating the cost.</p></li>
</ol>
