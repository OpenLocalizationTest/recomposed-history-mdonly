#Monitor logical servers and database instances

Monitoring tools and techniques that you might be accustomed to using on an on-premises server, such as auditing logins, running traces, and using performance counters, are not available for SQL Database. On Windows Azure, you use Data Management Views (DMVs) to monitor data capacity, query problems, and current connections. 

For more information, see [Monitoring SQL Database Using Dynamic Management Views][].
