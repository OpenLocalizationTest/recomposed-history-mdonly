#How to Connect Excel to Windows Azure HDInsight via HiveODBC

One key feature of Microsoftâ€™s Big Data Solution is the integration of  Microsoft Business Intelligence (BI) components with Apache Hadoop clusters that have been deployed by the Windows Azure HDInsight Service. A primary example of this integration is the ability to connect Excel to the Hive data warehouse framework in an HDInsight Hadoop cluster via the Hive Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) driver. This topic walks you through how to set up and use Hive from Excel to query data in an HDInsight cluster. There are three parts to this procedure:

1. [Install the Hive ODBC Driver](#InstallHiveODBCDriver)
2. [Create a Hive ODBC Data Source](#CreateHiveODBCDataSource)
3. [Import data into Excel](#ImportData)

**Prerequisites**:

* You have installed Excel 2010 or Excel 2013.
* You have a Windows Azure Account and have enabled the HDInsight Service for your subscription. For instructions on how to do this, see [Getting Started with Windows Azure HDInsight Service][getting-started] 

<h2><a id="InstallHiveODBCDriver"></a>Install the Hive ODBC Driver</h2>

Follow the steps below to install the Hive ODBC Driver.
 
1. Click the **Download** tile from the cluster dashboard on the HDInsight portal to bring up the links for downloading the Hive ODBC driver MSIs.

	![Hive ODBC Drivers](../media/HDI.HiveOdbcForExcel.Drivers.png)

2. If you have the 32-bit version of Excel installed, double click the **HiveODBCSetupx86.msi** link. If you have the 64-bit version of Excel installed, double click the **HiveODBCSetupx64.msi** link. If you are not sure which version of Excel you have installed, open Excel, go to **File** -> **Help** and inspect the version information provided in the **About Microsoft Excel** section.

3. Click Run when prompted and read the license agreement. 

4. If you agree to the license agreement, click **I agree** and  **Install**. 
   
	![Accept the EULA](../media/EULA-accept.PNG)

5. Once the installation has completed, click **Finish** to exit the Setup Wizard.

<b>Note</b>
	<p>The Hive ODBC driver is in Preview only and should not be used for production workloads. It is only supported on Windows and it is only supported to work with HDInsight Hive installations. Due to current limitations in Hive Server 1, the Hive ODBC driver is supported in single user mode only and should not be used to run concurrent queries from concurrent connections. Attempting to run multiple queries at the same time may result in unexpected behavior. We are working on providing support for Hive Server 2 for the ODBC driver. Hive Server 2 provides support for concurrency for ODBC and Java Database Connectivity (JDBC). At that time, the existing ODBC driver will be deprecated. To get more information about current Hive Server 1 limitations at <a href="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HiveServer2+Thrift+API">https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HiveServer2+Thrift+API</a> </p>

<h2><a id="CreateHiveODBCDataSource"></a>Create a Hive ODBC Data Source</h2>

The following steps show you how to create a Hive ODBC Data Source.

1. Click **Start** -> **Control Panel** to launch the **Control Panel** for Microsoft Windows. 

2. In the Control Panel, Click **System and Security**->**Administrative Tools**->**Data Sources (ODBC)**. This will launch the **ODBC Data Source Administrator** dialog. 
 
	![ODBCDSN](../media/ODBCDSN.PNG) 

3. In the **ODBC Data Source Administrator** dialog, click the **User DSN** tab. 

4. Click **Add** to add a new data source. 

5. Click the **HIVE** driver in the ODBC driver list.  

	![ODBCDSN](../media/HDI.HiveOdbc.CreateDataSource.PNG)

6. Click **Finish**. This will launch the ODBC Hive Setup dialog shown in the screenshot below. 

7. Enter a data source a name in the **Data Source Name** box. For Example, "MyHiveData". 

8. In the **Host** box , replace the cluster name to point to be the cluster that you created. For example, if your cluster name is "myhadoopcluster" then the final value for host should be "myhadoopcluster.azurehdinsight.net". Do not change the default port number of 10000.

9. Enter the username you used to authenticate on the portal. 

	![DSNconfig](../media/DSNconfig.png "DSN config")  

10. Click **OK** to save the new Hive data source. 

11. Click **OK** to close the ODBC Data Source Administrator dialog. 
	
 
<h2><a id="ImportData"></a>Import Data into Excel</h2>

The steps below describe the way to import data from a hive table into excel workbook using the ODBC data source that you  created in the steps above.

1. Open Excel.

2. In Excel, click the **Data** tab. 

3. Click **From Other Data Sources**.

4. Select **From Data Connection Wizard** to import data using the ODBC DSN that you created in the previous step. This will launch the **Data Connection Wizard**.

5. In **Data Connection Wizard**, select **ODBC DSN** as the data source and click **Next**.

	![Welcome to the Data Connection Wizard](../media/excelconn.png) 

6. In the **Connect to ODBC Data source** dialog, select the Data Source name that you created in the previous step (for example, "MyHive") and click **Next**.

7. In the **Hive Data Source Configuration** dialog, enter the password for the cluster and click **OK**.

8. In the **Data Link Properties** window, make sure that **Use connection string** is selected. Enter the username and password for the cluster, and select the **Initial catalog** that you wish to use. Click **OK**.

	![Data Link Properties](../media/excellink.png) 

9. When the **Select Database and Table** dialog opens, select the table that you want to import (for example, "HiveSamepletable") and click **Next**.

	![Select Database and Table](../media/exceltable.png "Excel Data Link") 

10. In the **Import Data** dialog, you can change or specify the query. To do so, click **Properties** to launch the **Connection Properties** dialog. Click on the **Defnition** tab and add "Limit 200" at the end of the query in the **command text** text box. You can also replace this query text with another query as needed.

11. See the note at the bottom of this section before proceding if you have Excel 2013 installed. Otherwise, click **OK** on the **Import Data** dialog.

12. In the **Data Connection** dialog, re-enter the password and click **OK**.

13. You will see the data from the hive table in the Excel workbook.

<div class="dev-callout">
<b>Note</b>
	<p>Please note that there is a known issue when of using this ODBC driver with Excel 2013. When you attempt to use this driver from Excel 2013, it may result in the program hanging. The work-around for this issue involves breaking the typical workflow for importing data into Excel 2013 into two parts:  </p>

<p> 1. In the typical Excel 2013 flow, you would begin by configuring your connection information first and then click the Finish button on the Data Connection Wizard dialog to save the .odc file. Excel would then present the Import Table Data dialog in order to run the query on the table you selected.</p>
 
<p> 2. This is where you break the usual workflow: Cancel the Import Table Data dialog at this point. Go back to the Existing Connections button on the Data tab on the ribbon and select the connection you just created. It should import the data successfully. </p>

<p>If this process is done in two steps as described, it prevents the underlying issue that causes the program to hang. It will also work correctly if you just add data to a workbook from a connection that was previously created.</p>

<p>The driver works correctly with Excel 2010, so this workaround is not needed for this earlier version of Excel.</p>
