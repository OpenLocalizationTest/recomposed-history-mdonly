#Using HDInsight to process Blob Storage data and write the results to a SQL Database

This tutorial will show you how to use the HDInsight service to process data stored in Windows Azure Blob Storage and move the results to a Windows Azure SQL Database. At a high level, these are the steps:

* [Upload data to Windows Azure Blob Storage](#Upload)
* [Create a HDInsight cluster](#CreateCluster)
* [Create a Hive table from the data in ASV](#CreateHiveTable)
* [Execute a HiveQL query and write the results to HDFS](#ExecuteHiveQuery)
* [Use Sqoop to copy data from HDFS to your SQL Database](#HDFStoSQL)  

This tutorial assumes you have a [Windows Azure subscription][free-trial], that you have [created a Windows Azure Storage Account][create-storage-account], and that you have enabled the [HDInsight Preview](https://account.windowsazure.com/PreviewFeatures).

Before preceding, note that the data used in this tutorial comes from RITA, the [Research and Innovative Technology Administration, Bureau of Transportation Statistics][rita-website]. From the [RITA website][rita-website], you can download information about on-time performance of airline flights across the United States. To get the data used for this tutorial, download files for each month of 2012 with the following field names selected: Year, FlightDate, UniqueCarrier, Carrier, FlightNum, OriginAirportID, Origin, OriginCityName, OriginState, DestAirportID, Dest, DestCityName, DestState, DepDelayMinutes, ArrDelay, ArrDelayMinutes, CarrierDelay, WeatherDelay, NASDelay, SecurityDelay, LateAircraftDelay. Each file is a CSV file and is approximately 60 GB in size.

<h2 id="Upload">Upload data to Windows Azure Blob Storage</h2> 
There are a number of ways to upload data to Windows Azure Blob Storage. Here, we will use the Windows Azure Storage Explorer, which can be downloaded for free from Codeplex: [http://azurestorageexplorer.codeplex.com/](http://azurestorageexplorer.codeplex.com/). Documentation for using the tool can be downloaded from here: [http://azurestorageexplorer.codeplex.com/documentation](http://azurestorageexplorer.codeplex.com/documentation).

First, create a container called **flightinfo** and upload the data files to this container. Next, rename each file by prefixing the existing name with `delays/`. (You can rename a file by selecting it and using the **Rename** option in Azure Storage Explorer.) This is necessary because, in order to create Hive tables from data in blob storage (which we will do later), files that will be loaded into a table must all have the same prefix in this form: `prefix/filename.csv`. When you are finished, you should have file names that look like this:

![ASV files][asv-files]

<h2 id="CreateCluster">Create a Hadoop cluster</h2>

To create a HDInsight cluster, login to the [Windows Azure Management Portal](https://windows.azure.com/), select **HDInsight** in the left column, then click **CREATE A HDINSIGHT CLUSTER**.

![Select HDInsight][create-cluster-1]

Provide the cluster name, select the number of data nodes, provide a password for the **admin** user, and select the storage account you created earlier.

![Fill in cluster information][create-cluster-2]

<div class="dev-callout"> 
<b>Note</b> 
<p>When you specify a storage account in the step above, the account is automatically configured as an Azure Storage Vault (ASV) file system. ASV is optimized to work with HDInsight by providing durable storage and fast access to data for map reduce jobs.</p> 
</div>

Cluster creation will take several minutes.

<h2 id="CreateHiveTable">Create a Hive table</h2>
The next step is to create a Hive table from the data in Azure Storage Vault (ASV). 

<div class="dev-callout"> 
<b>Note</b> 
<p>Many of the steps in this tutorial can be done from the interactive consoles that are available in the Windows Azure management portal. However, not all of them can and therefore must be done from a command-line shell after logging into the head node of the cluster. For the sake of being consistent in this tutorial, all commands will be shown in this way here.</p> 
</div>

Back in the management portal, click on the name of your cluster to go to the cluster dashboard.

![Go to cluster dashboard][create-cluster-3]

Next, click **START DASHBOARD** at the bottom of the page. You will be prompted for your cluster credentials.

![Start dashboard][start-dashboard]

In the cluster dashboard, click on **Remote Desktop**, open the RDP file, and login to the head node of your cluster by providing your cluster credentials.

![Remote desktop][remote-desktop]

After you have logged in, open a command-line shell and change directories to the `hive-0.9.0\bin` directory (typically here: `C:\apps\dist\hive-0.9.0\bin`). Type `hive` and press enter to begin a Hive session, then copy and paste the query below (replacing `storageaccountname` with the name of your storage account) which will create a Hive table from the files in ASV. Note that this query specifies that fields are delimited by commas and that lines are terminated by `\n`. This poses a problem when field values *contain* commas because Hive cannot differentiate between a comma that is a field delimiter and a one that is part of a field value (which is the case in field values for ORIGIN\_CITY\_NAME and DEST\_CITY\_NAME). To address this, the query below creates TEMP columns to hold data that is incorrectly split into columns. 

The ASV location is specified in the last line (the table will be created from all files with the `/delays` prefix). 

	create external table delays_raw (
		YEAR string, 
		FL_DATE string, 
		UNIQUE_CARRIER string, 
		CARRIER string, 
		FL_NUM string, 
		ORIGIN_AIRPORT_ID string, 
		ORIGIN string, 
		ORIGIN_CITY_NAME string,
		ORIGIN_CITY_NAME_TEMP string,
		ORIGIN_STATE_ABR string, 
		DEST_AIRPORT_ID string, 
		DEST string, 
		DEST_CITY_NAME string,
		DEST_CITY_NAME_TEMP string, 
		DEST_STATE_ABR string, 
		DEP_DELAY_NEW float, 
		ARR_DELAY_NEW float, 
		CARRIER_DELAY float, 
		WEATHER_DELAY float, 
		NAS_DELAY float, 
		SECURITY_DELAY float, 
		LATE_AIRCRAFT_DELAY float
	)
	row format delimited 
	fields terminated by ',' 
	lines terminated by '\n' 
	stored as textfile 
	location 'asv://flightinfo@storageaccountname/delays';

After executing the query above, you should see output similar to this:

	OK
	Time taken: 5.339 seconds 

Before executing queries on the raw data imported from ASV, it will be helpful to clean up some of the data. This can be done by executing the query below, which creates a new table, `delays`, from the `delays_raw` table. Note that the TEMP columns (as mentioned above) are not copied, and that the `substring` function is used to remove quotation marks from the data:

	create table delays as 
		select 
		YEAR as year, 
		FL_DATE as flight_date, 
		substring(UNIQUE_CARRIER, 2, length(UNIQUE_CARRIER) -1) as unique_carrier, 
		substring(CARRIER, 2, length(CARRIER) -1) as carrier, 
		substring(FL_NUM, 2, length(FL_NUM) -1) as flight_num, 
		ORIGIN_AIRPORT_ID as origin_airport_id, 
		substring(ORIGIN, 2, length(ORIGIN) -1) as origin_airport_code, 
		substring(ORIGIN_CITY_NAME, 2) as origin_city_name,
		substring(ORIGIN_STATE_ABR, 2, length(ORIGIN_STATE_ABR) -1)  as origin_state_abr, 
		DEST_AIRPORT_ID as dest_airport_id, 
		substring(DEST, 2, length(DEST) -1) as dest_airport_code,
		substring(DEST_CITY_NAME,2) as dest_city_name,
		substring(DEST_STATE_ABR, 2, length(DEST_STATE_ABR) -1) as dest_state_abr, 
		DEP_DELAY_NEW as dep_delay_new, 
		ARR_DELAY_NEW as arr_delay_new, 
		CARRIER_DELAY as carrier_delay, 
		WEATHER_DELAY as weather_delay, 
		NAS_DELAY as nas_delay, 
		SECURITY_DELAY as security_delay, 
		LATE_AIRCRAFT_DELAY as late_aircraft_delay
	from delays_raw;

After executing the query above, you should see output similar to this:

After the `delays` table has been created, you are now ready to run queries over it.

<h2 id="ExecuteHiveQuery">Execute a HiveQL query</h2>

In the query below, change `username` to the name of the logged in user, then copy/paste the query below into your Hive command-line session. This query will compute the average weather delay and group the results by city name. It will also output the results to HDFS. Note that the query is removing apostrophes from the data and is excluding rows where the value for `weather_dealy` is `null` (which is necessary because Sqoop, used in the next step, doesn't handle those values gracefully by default):

	INSERT OVERWRITE DIRECTORY '/user/username/queryoutput' select regexp_replace(origin_city_name, "'", ""), avg(weather_delay) from delays where weather_delay is not null group by origin_city_name;

Output from the query above should look similar to this:

	Total MapReduce jobs = 1
	Launching Job 1 out of 1
	Number of reduce tasks not specified. Estimated from input data size: 1
	In order to change the average load for a reducer (in bytes):
	  set hive.exec.reducers.bytes.per.reducer=<number>

<div class="dev-callout"> 
<b>Note</b> 
<p>If you want to see the results of the query before the results are written to HDFS, simply omit <code>INSERT OVERWRITE DIRECTORY '/user/username/queryoutput'</code>. The resulting query will output the results to the console.</p> 
</div>

After your Hive query results have been written to HDFS, you can import them to a Windows Azure SQL Database using Sqoop.

<h2 id="HDFStoSQL">Copy Data from HDFS to a SQL Database</h2>
Before copying data from HDFS to a Windows Azure SQL Database, the SQL Database must exist. To create a database, follow the instructions here: [Getting started with Windows Azure SQL Database](http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/manage/services/sql-databases/getting-started-w-sql-databases/). Note that your table schema must match that of the data in HDFS and it must have a clustered index. To use the command below, create a database called **MyDatabase** and a table called **AvgDelays** with the following schema:

![Table schema][table-schema]

Next, you will use the Sqoop command line tool to copy HDFS data to your SQL Database. To do this, return to your remote desktop session, quit your Hive session by entering `quit;` and change directories to the sqoop directory (typically `C:\apps\dist\sqoop-1.4.2\bin`). Execute the following command (replacing `SERVER`, `USER`, `PASSWORD`, `DATABASE`, and `username` with the appropriate values):

	sqoop-export.cmd --connect "jdbc:sqlserver://SERVER.database.windows.net;username=USER@SERVER;password=PASSWORD;database=DATABASE" --table AvgDelays --export-dir /user/username/queryoutput --fields-terminated-by \001 --lines-terminated-by '\r\n'

The output of the query above should look similar to this:

	13/03/03 22:30:11 WARN sqoop.SqoopOptions: Character argument '\r\n' has multiple characters; only the first will be used.
	13/03/03 22:30:11 WARN sqoop.SqoopOptions: Character argument '\r\n' has multiple characters; only the first will be used.

You should now be able to connect to your SQL Database and see average weather delays by city in the `AvgDelays` table:
