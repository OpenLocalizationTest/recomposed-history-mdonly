## <a id="virtualmachine"> </a>What is a virtual machine in Windows Azure ##

A virtual machine in Windows Azure is a server in the cloud that you can control and manage. After you create a virtual machine in Windows Azure, you can delete and recreate it whenever you need to, and you can log on to the virtual machine just as you do with any other server. Virtual hard disk (VHD) files are used to create a virtual machine. The following types of VHDs are used for a virtual machine in Windows Azure:

- **Image -** A VHD that is used as a template to create a new virtual machine. An image is a template because it doesn’t have specific settings like a running virtual machine, such as the computer name and user account settings. If you create a virtual machine using an image, an operating system disk is automatically created for the new virtual machine.
- **Disk -** A VHD that can be booted and mounted as a running version of an operating system. A disk is a runnable version of an image. Any VHD that is attached to virtualized hardware and running as part of a service is a disk. After an image is provisioned, it becomes a disk and a disk is always created when you use an image to create a virtual machine.

The following options are available for using images to create a virtual machine:

- Create a virtual machine by using an image that is provided in the Image Gallery of the Windows Azure Management Portal.
- Create and upload a VHD file that contains an image to Windows Azure, and then create a virtual machine using the image. For more information about creating and uploading a custom image, see the following topics:

## <a id="customcreate"> </a>How to create a custom virtual machine ##

You can create a custom virtual machine by providing advanced options, such as size, connected resources, DNS name, and network connection. You must use this option if you want to connect virtual machines or if you want to use a custom image to create the machine. 

Before you create a virtual machine, you should decide how it will be used. If you have a need for only one virtual machine in your application, you choose to create a stand-alone virtual machine. If you need multiple virtual machines in the same cloud service that can communicate with each other and act as a load-balanced application, you choose to connect the new virtual machine to an existing virtual machine.

1. Sign  in to the Windows Azure Management Portal.

2. On the command bar, click **New**.

## <a id="attachdisk"> </a>How to attach a data disk to a virtual machine ##

You can attach a data disk to a virtual machine to store application data. A data disk is a Virtual Hard Disk (VHD) that you can create either locally with your own computer or in the cloud with Windows Azure. You manage data disks in the virtual machine the same way you do on a server in your office.

You can upload and attach a data disk that already contains data to the virtual machine, or you can attach an empty disk to the machine. The virtual machine is not stopped to add the disk. You are limited in the number of disks that you can attach to a virtual machine based on the size of the machine. The following table lists the number of attached disks that are allowed for each size of virtual machine.

## <a id="communication"> </a>How to set up communication with a virtual machine ##

All virtual machines that you create in Windows Azure can automatically communicate using a private network channel with other virtual machines in the same cloud service or virtual network. However, you need to add an endpoint to a machine for other resources on the Internet or other virtual networks to communicate with it. You can associate specific ports and a protocol to endpoints. Resources can connect to an endpoint by using a protocol of TCP or UDP. The TCP protocol includes HTTP and HTTPS communication. 

Each endpoint defined for a virtual machine is assigned a public and private port for communication. The private port is defined for setting up communication rules on the virtual machine and the public port is used by the Windows Azure load balancer to communicate with the virtual machine from external resources.

1. If you have not already done so, sign in to the Windows Azure Management Portal.

2. Click **Virtual Machines**, and then select the virtual machine that you want to configure.

3. Click **Endpoints**.

	![Endpoints] (../media/endpointswindows.png)

4.	Click **Add Endpoint**.

	The **Add Endpoint** dialog box appears.

	![Add endpoints] (../media/addendpointwindows.png)

5. Accept the default selection of **Add Endpoint**, and then click the arrow to continue.

	![Enter endpoint details] (../media/endpointtcpwindows.png)

6. In **Name**, enter a name for the endpoint.

7. In **Public Port** and **Private Port**, type 80. These port numbers can be different. The public port is the entry point for communication from outside of Windows Azure and is used by the Windows Azure load balancer. You can use the private port and firewall rules on the virtual machine to redirect traffic in a way that is appropriate for your application.

8.	Click the check mark to create the endpoint.

	You will now see the endpoint listed on the **Endpoints** page.

	![Endpoint creation successful] (../media/endpointwindowsnew.png)

## <a id="capture"> </a>How to capture an image of a virtual machine ##

You can use images from the Image Gallery to easily create virtual machines, or you can capture and use your own images to create customized virtual machines. An image is a virtual hard disk (VHD) file that is used as a template for creating a virtual machine. An image is a template because it doesn’t have specific settings like a configured virtual machine, such as the computer name and user account settings. If you want to create multiple virtual machines that are set up the same way, you can capture an image of a configured virtual machine and use that image as a template.

### Capture an image of a virtual machine running Windows Server 2008 R2 ###

1. Connect to the virtual machine by using the steps listed in [How to log on to a virtual machine] [].

2.	Open a Command Prompt window as an administrator.

	![Run Sysprep.exe] (../media/sysprepcommand.png)

3.	Change the directory to `%windir%\system32\sysprep`, and then run sysprep.exe.

	The **System Preparation Tool** dialog box appears.
