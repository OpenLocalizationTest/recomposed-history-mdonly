4. Enter the following information for the new virtual machine:

	- **DNS Name** – the name that is used for both the virtual machine that is created and the cloud service that contains the virtual machine.
	- **Image** – the platform image that is used to create the virtual machine. If you want to create a virtual machine running the Linux operating system, you must use the **From Gallery** method to create the machine.
	- **Account Password** - enter and confirm a password for the Administrator account. You use this account to manage the virtual machine.
	- **Location** – the region that contains the virtual machine. 

5. Click the check mark to create the virtual machine.

	**Note:** A storage account is created to contain this virtual machine.  Only one storage account exists for holding these virtual machines, if it exists, it is used to for additional machines. 

	You will see the new virtual machine listed in on the **Virtual Machines** page.
