# How to Load Balance Traffic Equally Across a Set of Hosted Services by Using Windows Azure Traffic Manager #
[This topic contains preliminary content for the CTP release of [Windows Azure Traffic Manager](http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/home/features/virtual-network/). To begin using the feature, go to the Virtual Network tab located in the [Windows Azure Management Portal](https://login.live.com/login.srf?wa=wsignin1.0&rpsnv=11&ct=1337238929&rver=6.1.6195.0&wp=MBI_SSL&wreply=https:%2F%2Fwindows.azure.com%2Flanding%3Ftarget%3D%252fdefault.aspx&lc=1033&id=267163).]


The Windows Azure Traffic Manager allows you to control the distribution of user traffic to Windows Azure hosted services. For more information see [Overview of Windows Azure Traffic Manager]().

A common load balancing pattern is to provide a set of identical hosted services and send traffic to each in a round-robin fashion. This article outlines the steps to set up a Traffic Manager domain and policy to perform this type of load balancing.

For more information on the different load balancing methods that WATM provides, see [Load balancing methods in Windows Azure Traffic Manager]().

1. **Deploy your hosted services** into your production environment. See the Windows Azure MSDN documentation for information on developing and deploying [Windows Azure hosted services](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/gg432967.aspx). Also refer to [Best practices for hosted services and policies when using Windows Azure Traffic Manager]() which discusses important information on hosted services included in a Traffic Manager policy.

2. **Log into the Traffic Manager area in the Management Portal.** The Windows Azure Management Portal is at [http://windows.azure.com](http://windows.azure.com). Traffic Manager can be accessed by clicking on **Virtual Network** in the lower left of the portal pages and then choosing **Traffic Manager** from the options in the left pane.

3. **Choose Policies and click "Create".** Choose the folder **Policies** from the left navigation tree to enable **Create** in the top toolbar. Choose **Create**. The **Create Traffic Manager policy** dialog will appear.

4. **Choose a subscription.** Policies and domains are associated with single subscription.

5. **Select the Round Robin load balance method.** For more information about load balancing methods available in Traffic Manager, see [Load balancing methods in Windows Azure Traffic Manager]().

6. **Find hosted services and add them to the policy.** Use the filter box to find hosted services that contain the string you type into the box. Clear the box to display all hosted services in production for the subscription you selected in step 4. Use the arrow buttons to add them to the policy. The order in the **Selected DNS names** box does not matter for this load balancing method.

7. **Set up monitoring.** Monitoring insures that hosted services that are offline are not sent traffic. You must have a specific path and filename set up.
See [Monitoring hosted services in Windows Azure Traffic Manager]() for more information on the monitoring process.

8. **Name your Traffic Manager domain.** Give your domain a unique name. You can only specify the prefix for your domain. Leave the DNS time to live at its default time. 
See [Best practices for hosted services and policies when using Windows Azure Traffic Manager]() for more information on the effect of this setting. 
The **Create Traffic Manager policy** dialog box should be similar to the example below.

9. **Test the Traffic Manager domain and policy.** See [How To Test a Windows Azure Traffic Manager Policy]() for more information. 

10. **Point your DNS Server to the Traffic Manager domain.** Once your Traffic Manager Domain is setup and working, edit the DNS record on your authoritative DNS server to point your company domain to the Traffic Manager domain. 
For example, the following command routes all traffic going to **www.contoso.com** to the Traffic Manager domain **contoso.trafficmanager.net**: 
`` www.contoso.com IN CNAME contoso.trafficmanager.net``
