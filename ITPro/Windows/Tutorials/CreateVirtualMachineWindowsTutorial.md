## <a id="virtualmachine"> </a>What is a virtual machine in Windows Azure ##

A virtual machine in Windows Azure is a server in the cloud that you can control and manage. After you create a virtual machine in Windows Azure, you can delete and recreate it whenever you need to, and you can access the virtual machine just as you do with any other server. Virtual hard drive (VHD) files are used to create a virtual machine. The following types of VHDs are used for a virtual machine:

- **Image** - A VHD that is used as a template to create a new virtual machine. An image is a template because it doesnâ€™t have specific settings like a running virtual machine, such as the computer name and user account settings. If you create a virtual machine using an image, an operating system disk is automatically created for the new virtual machine.
- **Disk** - A VHD that can be booted and mounted as a running version of an operating system. A disk is a runnable version of an image. Any VHD that is attached to virtualized hardware and running as part of a service is a disk. After an image is provisioned, it becomes a disk and a disk is always created when you use an image to create a virtual machine.

The following options are available for using images to create a virtual machine:

- Create a virtual machine by using an image that is provided in the Image Gallery of the Windows Azure Management Portal.
- Create and upload a VHD file that contains an image to Windows Azure, and then create a virtual machine using the image. For more information about creating and uploading a custom image, see [Creating and Uploading a Virtual Hard Drive that Contains the Windows Server Operating System](http://).

## <a id="custommachine"> </a>How to create a custom virtual machine running the Windows Server operating system by using the Management Portal ##

You use the **From Gallery** method to create a custom virtual machine in the Management Portal. When you create this machine, you can define the size of the machine, the connected resources, the DNS name, and the network connectivity if needed.


1. Sign in to the Windows Azure Management Portal.
2. On the command bar, click **New**.

9. You can connect virtual machines together under a cloud service to provide robust applications, but for this tutorial, you only create a single virtual machine. To do this, select **Standalone Virtual Machine**.

10. A virtual machine that you create is contained in a cloud service. In **DNS Name**, type a name for the cloud service that is created for the virtual machine. The entry can contain from 3-24 lowercase letters and numbers. This value becomes part of the URI that is used to contact the cloud service that the machine belongs to. For this virtual machine, type **MyService1**.

11. You can select a storage account where the VHD file is stored. For this tutorial, accept the default setting of **Use Automatically Generated Storage Account**.

12. In **Region/Affinity Group/Virtual Network**, select **West US** for where the location of the virtual machine.

13. Click the arrow to continue.

	The **VM Options** dialog box appears.

	![Specify the connection options of the machine] (../media/imageoptionswindows.png)

14. The options on this page are only used if you are connecting this virtual machine to other machines or if you are adding the machine to a virtual network. For this virtual machine, you are not creating an availability set or connecting to a virtual network. Click the check mark to create the virtual machine.
    
	The virtual machine is created and operating system settings are configured. When the virtual machine is created, you will see the new virtual machine listed as **Running** in the Windows Azure Management Portal.

## <a id="logon"> </a>How to log on to the virtual machine after you create it ##

You can log on to the virtual machine that you created to manage the settings of the machine and the applications that run on the machine.

1. If you have not already done so, sign in to the [Windows Azure Management Portal](http://www.windowsazure.com).

2. Click **Virtual Machines**, and then select the **MyTestVM1** virtual machine that you previously created.

3. On the command bar, click **Connect**.

	![Connect to the virtual machine] (../media/connectwindows.png)

4. Click **Open** to use the remote desktop protocol file that was automatically created for the virtual machine.

	![Use the remote desktop protcol file] (../media/connectrdp.png)

5. Click **Connect** to proceed with the connection process.

	![Continue with connecting] (../media/connectpublisher.png)

6. Type **MyPassword1** for the password of the Administrator account on the virtual machine, and then click **OK**.

	![Verify the identity of the machine] (../media/connectverify.png)</P>

	You can now work with the virtual machine just as you would with a server in your office.

## <a id="attachdisk"> </a>How to attach a data disk to the new virtual machine ##

Your application may need to store data. To set this up, you attach a data disk to the virtual machine that you previously created. The easiest way to do this is to attach an empty data disk to the machine.

1. If you have not already done so, sign in to the Windows Azure Management Portal.

1. Click **Virtual Machines**, and then select the **MyTestVM1** virtual machine that you previously created.

2. On the command bar, click **Attach**, and then click **Attach Empty Disk**.

	![Attach empty disk] (../media/attachdiskwindows.png)

	The **Attach Empty Disk** dialog box appears.

	![Attach empty disk] (../media/attachnewdiskwindows.png)

3. The **Virtual Machine Name**, **Storage Location**, and **File Name** are already defined for you. All you have to do is enter the size that you want for the disk. Type **5** in the **Size** field.

	**Note:** All disks are created from a VHD file in Windows Azure storage. You can provide a name for the VHD file that is added to storage, but the name of the disk is automatically generated.

4. Click the check mark to attach the data disk to the virtual machine.

5. You can verify that the data disk is successfully attached to the virtual machine by looking at the dashboard. Click the name of the virtual machine to display the dashboard.

	The number of disks is now 2 for the virtual machine and the disk that you attached is listed in the **Disks** table.

	![Attach empty disk] (../media/attachemptysuccess.png)

The data disk that you just attached to the virtual machine is offline and not initialized after you add it. You must log on to the machine and initialize the disk to use it for storing data.

1. Connect to the virtual machine by using the steps listed in **Log on to the virtual machine**.

2. After you log on to the virtual machine, open **Server Manager**, in the left pane, expand **Storage**, and then click **Disk Management**.

	![Initialize the disk in Server Manager] (../media/servermanager.png)

3. Right-click **Disk 2**, and then click **Initialize Disk**.

	![Start initialization] (../media/initializedisk.png)

## <a id="endpoints"> </a>How to set up communication with the virtual machine ##

All virtual machines that you create in Windows Azure can automatically communicate with other virtual machines in the same cloud service or virtual network. However, you need to add an endpoint to a machine for other resources on the Internet or other virtual networks to communicate with it. You can associate specific ports and a protocol to endpoints.

1. If you have not already done so, sign in to the Windows Azure Management Portal.</P>

2. Click **Virtual Machines**, and then select the **MyTestVM1** virtual machine that you previously created.

3. Click **Endpoints**.

	![Add endponts] (../media/endpointswindows.png)

4. For this tutorial, you will add an endpoint for communicating with the virtual machine using the TCP protocol. Click **Add Endpoint**.

	![Endpoints] (../media/addendpointstart.png)

	The **Add Endpoint** dialog box appears.

	![Add TCP endpont] (../media/addendpointwindows.png)

5. Accept the default selection of **Add Endpoint**, and then click the arrow to continue.

	The **New Endpoint Details** dialog box appears.

	![Define the endpont] (../media/endpointtcpwindows.png)

6. In the Name field, type **MyTCPEndpoint1**.

7. In the **Public Port** and **Private Port** fields, type **80**. These port numbers can be different. The public port is the entry point for communication from outside of Windows Azure and is used by the Windows Azure load balancer. You can use the private port and firewall rules on the virtual machine to redirect traffic in a way that is appropriate for your application.

8. Click the check mark to create the endpoint.

	You will now see the endpoint listed on the **Endpoints** page.
