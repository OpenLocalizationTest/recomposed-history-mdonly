<div chunk="../../shared/chunks/disclaimer.md" />

For a virtual machine that is running the Windows Server 2008 R2 operating system, you use the Connect button in the Management Portal to start a Remote Desktop Connection. 

1. If you have not already done so, sign in to the [Windows Azure Management Portal](http://manage.windowsazure.com).

2. Click **Virtual Machines**, and then select the virtual machine that you want to log onto.

3. On the command bar, click **Connect**.
