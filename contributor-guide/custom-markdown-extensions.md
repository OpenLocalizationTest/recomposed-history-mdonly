#Custom markdown extensions used in our technical articles

In our articles, you use standard markdown for most basic article formatting - paragraphs, links, lists, headings, etc. However, we use custom markdown extensions where we need richer formatting in the rendered pages on azure.microsoft.com. Here's the extensions we are currently using.

##Notes and tips
You can choose from 4 types of notes and tips:

- AZURE.NOTE
- AZURE.WARNING
- AZURE.TIP
- AZURE.IMPORTANT

###Usage 
In general, use notes and tips sparingly throughout your articles. When you do use them, choose the appropriate type of note or tip:

- Use AZURE.NOTE when you need to highlight neutral or positive information that emphasizes or supplements key points of the main text. A note supplies information that may apply only in special cases.

- Use AZURE.WARNING when you need to alert the user to a condition that might cause a problem in the future. For example, selecting a certain option or making a certain choice might permanently lock you into a particular scenario.

- Use AZURE.TIP when you want to help your users apply the techniques and procedures described in the text to their specific needs. A tip might also suggest alternative methods that may not be obvious. Tips, however, are not essential to the basic understanding of the text.

- Use AZURE.IMPORTANT to provide information that is essential to the completion of a task.

While notes do support code blocks, images, lists, and links, try to keep your notes and tips simple and straightforward. If you find yourself needing to create a very complex note with lots of formatting, that might be a sign you just need another section in the main text of the article. And, too many notes in an article can be distracting and hard to scan or read. Use notes and tips sparingly. 

###Sample markdown

The samples all show an AZURE.NOTE. To use a TIP, WARNING, or IMPORTANT, replace "NOTE" in the markdown:

    > [AZURE.TIP]

    > [AZURE.WARNING]

    > [AZURE.IMPORTANT] 

Single paragraph:

    > [AZURE.NOTE] To complete this tutorial, you must have an active Microsoft Azure account. If you don't have an account, you can create a free trial account in just a couple of minutes. 

Multiparagraph:

    > [AZURE.NOTE] To complete this tutorial, you must have an active Microsoft Azure account. 
    > 
    > If you don't have an account, you can [create a free trial account](http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial/) in just a couple of minutes.
