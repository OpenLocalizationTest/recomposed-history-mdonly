#Metadata for Azure technical articles

All Azure technical articles contain two metadata sections - a properties section and a tags section. The properties section enables some website automation and SEO stuff, while the tags section enables a lot of internal content reporting. Both sections are required.

##Syntax

The properties section uses this syntax:

    <properties title="required" pageTitle="required" description="required" metaKeywords="" services="" solutions="" documentationCenter="" authors="Your GitHub account" videoId="" scriptId="" manager="required" />

The tags section uses this syntax:

    <tags ms.service="required" ms.devlang="may be required" ms.topic="article" ms.tgt_pltfrm="may be required" ms.workload="required" ms.date="mm/dd/yyyy" ms.author="Your MSFT alias or your full email address" />

##Usage

- The element name and attribute names are case sensitive.
- The <properties> section must be the first line of your file, and it must exist as a single line (e.g. don't add any line breaks between attributes).
- Leave a blank line after each metadata section and before your page title to ensure that the page title is correctly converted to HTML during the publishing process.
