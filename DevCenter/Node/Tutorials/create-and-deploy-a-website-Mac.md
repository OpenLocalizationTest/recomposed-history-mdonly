#Create and deploy a Node.js application to a Windows Azure Website

This tutorial shows you how to create a [node] application and deploy it to a Windows Azure Website using [Git]. The instructions in this tutorial can be followed on any operating system that is capable of running node.

You will learn:

* How to setup required developer tools

* How to create a Windows Azure Web Site using the Windows Azure Developer Portal

* How to publish and re-publish your application to Windows Azure using Git

* How to stop and delete a Windows Azure Web Site

By following this tutorial, you will build a simple Hello World web application in node. The application will be hosted in a Windows Azure Website when deployed.
 
A screenshot of the completed application is below:

**Note**: This tutorial makes reference to the **helloworld** folder. The full path to this folder is omitted, as path semantics differ between operating systems. You should create this folder in a location that is easy for you to access on your local file system, such as **~/node/helloworld** or **c:\node\helloworld**

**Note**: Many of the steps below mention using the command-line. For these steps, use the command-line for your operating system, such as **Windows PowerShell**, **cmd.exe**, **GitBash** (Windows,) or **Bash** (Unix Shell). On OS X systems you can access the command-line through the Terminal application.

##Prerequisites

Before following the instructions in this article, you should ensure that you have the following installed:

* A text editor

* A web browser

##Install developer tools

To successfully complete the steps in this tutorial, you must have a working installation of node and Git. Installation packages for node are available from the [nodejs.org download page] while installation packages for Git are available from the [git-scm.com download page].

If a pre-compiled version is not listed for your operating system, you may be able to obtain one through your operating system's [package management system]. Alternatively, you can download and compile the source code from the download pages listed above.


##Build and test your application locally

In this section, you will create a **server.js** file containing the 'hello world' example from [nodejs.org]. This example has been modified from the original example by adding process.env.port as the port to listen on when running in a Windows Azure Web Site.

1. Using a text editor, create a new file named **server.js** in the **helloworld** directory. If the **helloworld** directory does not exist, create it.

2. Add the following as the contents of the **server.js** file, and then save it:

        var http = require('http')
        var port = process.env.port || 1337;
        http.createServer(function(req, res) {
          res.writeHead(200, { 'Content-Type': 'text/plain' });
          res.end('Hello World\n');
        }).listen(port);

3. Open the command-line, and use the following command to start the web page locally:

        node server.js

4. Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:1337. A web page displaying "Hello World" will appear as shown in the screenshot below:

    ![A browser displaying the 'Hello World' message.][helloworld-localhost]

5. To stop the application, switch to the Terminal window and hold down the **CTRL** and **C** keys on your keyboard.

##Create a Windows Azure Website and enable Git publishing

Follow these steps to create a Windows Azure Website, and then enable Git publishing for the website. If you do not already have a Windows Azure subscription, you can sign up [for free].

1. Login to the [Windows Azure Portal].

2. Click the **+ NEW** icon on the bottom left of the portal

    ![The Windows Azure Portal with the +NEW link highlighted.][portal-new-website]

3. Click **WEB SITE**, then **QUICK CREATE**. Enter a value for **URL** and select the datacenter for your website in the **REGION** dropdown. Click the checkmark at the bottom of the dialog.

    ![The Quick Create dialog][portal-quick-create]

4. Once the website status changes to **Running**, click on the name of the website to access the **Dashboard**

	![The list of websites.][portal-website-list]

6. At the bottom right of the Dashboard, select **Set up Git Publishing**.

	![The dashboard, with Set up Git Publishing highlighted.][portal-website-dashboard-setup-git]

7. To enable Git publishing, you must provide a user name and password. If you have previously enabled publishing for a Windows Azure Website, you will not be prompted for the user name or password. Instead, a Git repository will be created using the user name and password you previously specified. Make a note of the user name and password, as they will be used for Git publishing to all Windows Azure Websites you create.

	![The dialog prompting for user name and password.][portal-git-username-password]

8. Once the Git repository is ready, click **Push my local files to Windows Azure** for instructions on the Git commands to use in order to setup a local repository and then push the files to Windows Azure.

	![Git deployment instructions returned after creating a repository for the website.][portal-git-instructions]

	**Note**: Save the instructions returned by the **Push my local files to Windows Azure** link, as they will be used in the next section.

##Publish your application

1. From the command-line, change directories to the **helloworld** directory and enter the following commands to initialize a local Git repository. If you have already initialized a local repository for this application, skip this step.

		git init

2. Use the following commands to add files to the repository:

		git add .
		git commit -m "initial commit"

3. A Git remote is a link to a remote repository, either for fetching updates from the remote repository or pushing updates to it. To create a remote for the Windows Azure Website you created previously, use the following command:

		git add remote azure [URL for remote repository]

	This will create a remote named **azure**.

	**Note**: the URL used should be the one returned at the end of the **Create a Windows Azure Website and Set up Git Publishing** section.

4. Push the local repository to the **master** branch of the remote repository **azure** repository by using the following command:

		git push azure master

	You will be prompted for the password you created earlier.

5. Browse to **http://[your website url]/** to begin using the application.

###Modify and re-publish your application

1. Open the **server.js** file in a text editor, and change 'Hello World\n' to 'Hello Azure\n'. Save the file.

2. From the command-line, change directories to the **helloworld** directory and enter the following commands to commit changes to the local repository:

		git add .
		git commit -m "changing to hello azure"

3. Use the following command to push updates to the **azure** remote:

		git push azure master

4. Browse to **http://[your website url]/** and note that the updates have been applied.

##Stop and delete your application

The following steps show you how to stop and delete your application.

1. If it is not already open, navigate to the [Windows Azure Portal] and login using your web browser.

2. Click on **WEB SITES** in the navigation bar on the left, and then select your website from the list.

	![The website list.][portal-website-list]

3. At the bottom of the page, click **Stop** to stop your web application; click **Delete** to delete it.

##Next steps

While the steps in this article use the Windows Azure Portal to create, stop, and delete a website, you can also use the [Windows Azure Command-Line Tools for Mac and Linux] to perform the these and other operations.
