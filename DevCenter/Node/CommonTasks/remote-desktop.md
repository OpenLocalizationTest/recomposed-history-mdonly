# Enabling Remote Desktop in Windows Azure

Remote Desktop enables you to access the desktop of a role instance
running in Windows Azure. You can use a remote desktop connection to
configure the virtual machine or troubleshoot problems with your
application.

This task includes the following steps:

-   [Step 1: Configure the service for Remote Desktop access using Windows Azure PowerShell for Node.js]
-   [Step 2: Connect to the role instance]
-   [Step 3: Configure the service to disable Remote Desktop access
    using Windows Azure PowerShell for Node.js]

## <a name="step1"> </a>Step 1: Configure the service for Remote Desktop access using Windows Azure PowerShell for Node.js

To use Remote Desktop, you need to configure your service definition and
service configuration with a username, password, and certificate to
authenticate with role instances in the cloud. [Windows Azure PowerShell
for Node.js][] includes the **Enable-AzureRemoteDesktop** cmdlet, which
does this configuration for you.

Perform the following steps from the computer where the service
definition was created.

1.  From the **Start** menu, select **Windows Azure PowerShell for
    Node.js**.

2.  Change directory to the service directory, type
    **Enable-AzureRemoteDesktop**, and then enter a user name and
    password to use when authenticating with role instances in the
    cloud:

    ![][1]

3.  Publish the service configuration changes to the cloud. At the
    **Windows Azure PowerShell for Node.js** prompt, type
    **Publish-AzureService**:

    ![][2]

When these steps have been completed, the role instances of the service
in the cloud are configured for Remote Desktop access.

## <a name="step2"> </a>Step 2: Connect to the role instance

With your deployment up and running in Windows Azure, you can connect to
the role instance.

1.  In the [Windows Azure Management Portal], select **Cloud Services**, the service deployed in Step 1 above, and then click the Configure

When the deployment status in the Windows Azure Management Portal is
    **Ready**, select an instance of the deployment, and click
    **Connect** in the **Remote Access** area of the portal ribbon.

    ![][3]

2.  When you click **Connect**, the web browser prompts you to save an
    .rdp file. If youâ€™re using Internet Explorer, click **Open**.

    ![][4]

3.  When the file is opened, the following security prompt appears:

    ![][5]

4.  Click **Connect**, and a security prompt will appear for entering
    credentials to access the instance. Enter the password you created
    in [Step 1][Step 1: Configure the service for Remote Desktop access
    using Windows Azure PowerShell for Node.js], and then click **OK**.

    ![][6]

When the connection is made, Remote Desktop Connection displays the
desktop of the instance in Windows Azure. You have successfully gained
remote access to your instance and can perform any necessary tasks to
manage your application.

## <a name="step3"> </a>Step 3: Configure the service to disable Remote Desktop access using Windows Azure PowerShell for Node.js

When you no longer require remote desktop connections to the role
instances in the cloud, disable remote desktop access using the [Windows
Azure PowerShell for Node.js][]

1.  From the **Start** menu, select **Windows Azure PowerShell for
    Node.js**.

    ![][0]

2.  Change directory to the service directory, and type
    **Disable-AzureRemoteDesktop**:

    ![][8]

3.  Publish the service configuration changes to the cloud. At the
    **Windows Azure PowerShell for Node.js** prompt, type
    **Publish-AzureService**:
