# Validate and modify data in Mobile Services
Language: **C# and XAML**  

This topic shows you how to work with data in Windows Azure Mobile Services from a Windows app. In this tutorial, you will create a new mobile service without following the Mobile Services quickstart, integrate the mobile service  with your Windows app, and then login to the Windows Azure Management Portal to view changes to data made when running the app.

This tutorial is based on a *sample app*. The first thing that you need to do is to download this sample application.

1. Add string length validation for todo item text using insert and update scripts. 
2. (?) Add error handling to scripts by modifying response. Modify client app to show error message based on service response.
3. Augment todo item by adding date(time) of creation
4. Run the app and browse data in portal to see added column and datetime info for new rows (only)

Add a query to client to restrict results to last few minutes
