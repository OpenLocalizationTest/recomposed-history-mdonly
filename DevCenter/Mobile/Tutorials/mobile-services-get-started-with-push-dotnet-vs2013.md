This topic shows how Visual Studio 2013 lets you use Windows Azure Mobile Services to send push notifications to your Windows Store app. In this tutorial you add push notifications using the Windows Push Notification service (WNS) to the quickstart project, right from Visual Studio. When complete, your mobile service will send a push notification each time a record is inserted.

<div class="dev-callout"><b>Note</b>
<p>This tutorial requires Visual Studio 2013, which makes it easier to send push notifications to your Windows Store app using Mobile Services. To complete the same basic procedure using Visual Studio 2012, follow the steps in the topic <a href="/en-us/develop/mobile/tutorials/get-started-with-push-dotnet-vs2012/">Get started with push notifications in Mobile Services using Visual Studio 2012</a>.</p>
</div>

This tutorial walks you through these basic steps to enable push notifications:

1. [Register your app for push notifications and configure Mobile Services]
2. [Update the generated push notification code]

This tutorial is based on the Mobile Services quickstart. Before you start this tutorial, you must first complete either [Get started with Mobile Services] or [Get started with data] to connect your project to the mobile service. When a mobile service has not been connected, the Add Push Notification wizard creates this connection for you. 

<h2><a name="register"></a><span class="short-header">Register your app</span>Add and configure push notifications in the app</h2>

<div chunk="../chunks/mobile-services-create-new-push-vs2013.md" />

	<div class="dev-callout"><b>Note</b>
	<p>When your app isn't already configured to connect to the mobile service, the wizard also completes the same configuration tasks demonstrated in <a href="/en-us/develop/mobile/tutorials/get-started-with-data-dotnet/">Get started with data</a>.</p>
	</div>

7. (Optional) Open the generated push.register.js code file and inspect the code that obtains the installation ID and channel for the device and inserts this data into the new channels table. This table was created in your mobile service by the Add Push Notification wizard. This code ensures that registration of the device is attempted whenever the app is activated.

8. (Optional) In Server Explorer, expand Windows Azure Mobile Services, your service name, then channels, and open the insert.js file. This file, which is stored in your mobile service, contains JavaScript code that is executed when a client sends a request to register a device by inserting data into the channels table. The initial version of this file contains code that checks for an existing registration for the device. It also contains code that sends a push notification when a new registration is added to the channels table. 

9. Press the F5 key to run the app and verify that a notification is immediately received from the mobile service. This notification was generated by inserting a row into the new channels table, which is the device registration.


<h2><a name="add-push"></a><span class="short-header">Add push notifications</span>Add push notifications to your app</h2>

1. Open the file App.xaml.cs and add the following using statement:

        using Windows.Networking.PushNotifications;

2. Add the following to App.xaml.cs:
	
        public static PushNotificationChannel CurrentChannel { get; private set; }

	    private async void AcquirePushChannel()
	    {
	            CurrentChannel =  
	                await PushNotificationChannelManager.CreatePushNotificationChannelForApplicationAsync();
        }

   This code acquires and stores a push notification channel.
    
3. At the top of the **OnLaunched** event handler in App.xaml.cs, add the following call to the new **AcquirePushChannel** method:

        AcquirePushChannel();

   This guarantees that the **CurrentChannel** property is initialized each time the application is launched.
		
4. Open the project file MainPage.xaml.cs and add the following new attributed property to the **TodoItem** class:

        [JsonProperty(PropertyName = "channel")]
        public string Channel { get; set; }

    <div class="dev-callout"><b>Note</b>
	<p>When dynamic schema is enabled on your mobile service, a new 'channel' column is automatically added to the <strong>TodoItem</strong> table when a new item that contains this property is inserted.</p>
    </div>

5. Replace the **ButtonSave_Click** event handler method with the following code:

	        private void ButtonSave_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
	        {
	            var todoItem = new TodoItem { Text = TextInput.Text, Channel = App.CurrentChannel.Uri };
	            InsertTodoItem(todoItem);
            }

   This sets the client's current channel value on the item before it is sent to the mobile service.

6. (Optional) If you are not using the Management Portal-generated quickstart project, open the Package.appxmanifest file and make sure that in the **Application UI** tab, **Toast capable** is set to **Yes**.

   ![][15]

   This makes sure that your app can raise toast notifications. These notifications are already enabled in the downloaded quickstart project.

<h2><a name="update-scripts"></a><span class="short-header">Update the insert script</span>Update the registered insert script in the Management Portal</h2>

1. In the Management Portal, click the **Data** tab and then click the **TodoItem** table. 

   ![][11]

2. In **todoitem**, click the **Script** tab and select **Insert**.
   
  ![][12]

   This displays the function that is invoked when an insert occurs in the **TodoItem** table.

3. Replace the insert function with the following code, and then click **Save**:

        function insert(item, user, request) {
            request.execute({
                success: function() {
                    // Write to the response and then send the notification in the background
                    request.respond();
                    push.wns.sendToastText04(item.channel, {
                        text1: item.text
                    }, {
                        success: function(pushResponse) {
                            console.log("Sent push:", pushResponse);
                        }
                    });
                }
            });
        }

   This registers a new insert script, which uses the [wns object] to send a push notification (the inserted text) to the channel provided in the insert request.

<h2><a name="test"></a><span class="short-header">Test the app</span>Test push notifications in your app</h2>

1. In Visual Studio, press the F5 key to run the app.

2. In the app, type text in **Insert a TodoItem**, and then click **Save**.

   ![][13]

   Note that after the insert completes, the app receives a push notification from WNS.

   ![][14]

In this simple example a user receives a push notification with the data that was just inserted. The channel used by WNS is supplied to the mobile service by the client in the request. In the next tutorial, [Push notifications to app users], you will create a separate Channel table in which to store channel URIs and send a push notification out to all stored channels when an insert occurs.
