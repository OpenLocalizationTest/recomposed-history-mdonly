This topic shows how Visual Studio 2013 lets you use Windows Azure Mobile Services to send push notifications to your Windows Store app. In this tutorial you add push notifications using the Windows Push Notification service (WNS) to the quickstart project, right from Visual Studio. When complete, your mobile service will send a push notification each time a record is inserted.

<div class="dev-callout"><b>Note</b>
<p>This tutorial requires Visual Studio 2013, which makes it easier to send push notifications to your Windows Store app using Mobile Services. To complete the same basic procedure using Visual Studio 2012, follow the steps in the topic <a href="/en-us/develop/mobile/tutorials/get-started-with-push-dotnet-vs2012/">Get started with push notifications in Mobile Services using Visual Studio 2012</a>.</p>

This tutorial walks you through these basic steps to enable push notifications:

1. [Register your app for push notifications and configure Mobile Services]
2. [Update the generated push notification code]
3. [Insert data to receive notifications]

This tutorial is based on the Mobile Services quickstart. Before you start this tutorial, you must first complete either [Get started with Mobile Services] or [Get started with data] to connect your project to the mobile service. When a mobile service has not been connected, the Add Push Notification wizard creates this connection for you. 

<h2><a name="register"></a><span class="short-header">Register your app</span>Add and configure push notifications in the app</h2>

<div chunk="../chunks/mobile-services-create-new-push-vs2013.md" />

7. Expand **services**, **mobile services**, your service name, open the generated code file, and then inspect the **UploadChannel** method that obtains the installation ID and channel for the device and inserts this data into the new channels table. 

	 A call to this method was also added by the wizard to the **OnLaunched** event handler in the App.xaml.cs code file. This ensures that registration of the device is attempted whenever the app is launched. 

8. In Server Explorer, expand **Windows Azure**, **Mobile Services**, your service name, and **channels**, then open the insert.js file. 

	This file, which is stored in your mobile service, contains JavaScript code that is executed when a client sends a request to register a device by inserting data into the channels table. 

	<div class="dev-callout"><b>Note</b>
		<p>The initial version of this file contains code that checks for an existing registration for the device. It also contains code that sends a push notification when a new registration is added to the channels table. The code that sends a push notification can be included in any registered script file. The location of this script depends on how the notification is triggered. Scripts can be registered against an insert, update, delete or read operation against a table; as a scheduled job; or as a custom API. For more information, see <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=287178">Work with server scripts in Mobile Services</a>.</p>
	</div> 

9. Press the F5 key to run the app and verify that a notification is immediately received from the mobile service. 
	
	This notification was generated by inserting a row into the new channels table, which is the device registration.

While the generated code makes it easy to demonstrate a notification when the app is run, this is not generally a meaningful scenario. Next, you will remove the notification code from the channels table and replace it, with some changes, in the TodoItem table. 

<h2><a name="update-scripts"></a><span class="short-header">Update the code</span>Update the generated push notification code</h2>

<div chunk="../chunks/mobile-services-create-new-push-vs2013-2.md" />

<h2><a name="test"></a><span class="short-header">Test the app</span>Test push notifications in your app</h2>

1. In Visual Studio, press the F5 key to run the app.

2. In the app, type text in **Insert a TodoItem**, and then click **Save**.

   Note that after the insert completes, the app receives a push notification from WNS.
