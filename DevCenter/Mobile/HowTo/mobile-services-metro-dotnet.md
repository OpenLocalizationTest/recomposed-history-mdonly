# How to Use Mobile Services in Metro-style Apps
Language: [JavaScript and HTML][] | **VB/C# and XAML**

This guide will demonstrate how to use Windows Azure Mobile Services to easily create a Windows 8 Metro-style app that uses Windows Azure as the backend service for storage and authentication. Because you can develop Metro-style apps using either JavaScript and HTML or C#/VB and XAML, there is a version of this guide for each language.

## <a name="what-is"> </a>What is Mobile Services
Windows Azure Mobile Services is a Windows Azure service offering designed to make it easy to create highly-functional mobile apps using Windows Azure. Mobile Services brings together a set of Windows Azure services that enable backend capabilities for mobile apps.

<div class="dev-callout"> 
<b>Note</b> 
<p>In this preview release, Mobile Services only supports Windows 8 Metro-style apps.</p> 
</div>

## <a name="concepts"> </a>Concepts
The following concepts are important for understanding the capabilities of Mobile Services:

-	**Mobile service instance:** Mobile Services provides a backend for your mobile apps such that each app has a unique mobile service instance. The Windows Azure Preview Management Portal enables you to create and manage your mobile services. You can independently manage settings, tables and scripts for each mobile service instance. 
-	**Tables:** Mobile Services provides structured data storage for your apps in the form of tables. However, unlike tables in Windows Azure SQL Database, Mobile Services dynamically defines table schema based on the data that is uploaded from your app. You can use the Preview Management Portal to manually define and modify indexes and columns in tables. 
-	**Authentication:** In this preview release, Mobile Services supports authentication for Windows 8 Metro-style apps by using Windows Live. Support for identity providers will be expanded in future releases.
-	**Permissions:** Mobile Services allows you to restrict the operations against a table. This can be used to restrict operations to only authenticated users or users that have an application key.
-	**Keys:** Mobile Services supports application keys. While not strictly a security feature, an application key, which is known to your app, can be used to filter out random HTTP requests not originiating from the app. 
-	**Push notifications:** Mobile Services authenticates with the Windows Push Notification Services (WNS) to send notifications.
-	**Scripts:** Mobile Services enables you to inject business logic into the mobile service, such as performing simple validation or authorization and even sending push notifications. The service can execute JavaScript in response to any table operation (create, read, update and delete).


## <a name="getting-started"> </a>Getting started with Mobile Services
This guide 
In this guide, you will complete the following basic steps to create a working Windows 8 Metro-style app that uses Mobile Services:

1.	Register for the Mobile Services preview
2.	Create a new mobile service in the Preview Management Portal.
3.	Complete the tutorial in the Preview Management Portal to create a Metro-style app that accesses the new mobile service. 

Once you have completed the guide, 

### Prerequisities
To complete the tasks in this guide, you will need the following:

- A computer or virtual machine running Windows 8
- Visual Studio 2012 Express for Windows 8
- An active Windows Azure account

###<a name="signup-for-mobile-preview"> </a>Register for the Mobile Services preview

1.	Sign into WindowsAzure.com.

	<div class="dev-callout"> 
	<b>Note</b> 
	<p>If you do not have a Live ID account, register for one at login.live.com.</p> 
	</div>

2.	Sign up for free trial or use existing subscription.

3.	Make sure you are signed into [WindowsAzure.com][] with your Azure subscription, browse to the [Preview Management Portal][Management Portal preview]. 

4.	In the Mobile Services section, \*\**do something here*\*\*.

5.	\*\**Add other instructions as appropriate.*\*\*

###<a name="define-mobile-service-instance"> </a>Define the mobile service instance 
At this point, you must login to the Preview Management Portal to create a new mobile service instance.

1.	Log into the [Preview Management Portal][Management Portal preview]. 
2.	At the bottom of the navigation pane, click **+NEW**.

	![][0]

3.	Click **Mobile Service** and then click **Quick Create**.

	![][1]

4.	In **Name**, type a subdomain name to use in the URI for the mobile services instance. The entry can contain from 3-24 lowercase letters and numbers. This value becomes the host name within the URI that is used to address the mobile service instance, and must be globally unique in Mobile Services.

5.	From **Choose Database**, click **New Database**. Mobile Services will create a new SQL Database for your mobile service instance. Because the administrator username and password are auto-generated, you will later reset the password after the service is created.

	![][2] 

6.	Choose a location for the data center in which to host your mobile service instance, and then click **create mobile service**. 

	![][3]

7.	\*\**How do we get to the page to reset the Admin password on the new DB?*\*\*

8. In **Reset Password**, supply a new administrator password for the database.

	![][4]

You now have a new service instance that can be used by your mobile application. Next, you will create a table in which to store application data.

###<a name="add-storage-table"></a>Add a new storage table
1.	In the [Preview Management Portal][Management Portal preview], click **Mobile Services**. Then click the name of the new mobile service to open the dashboard.

	![][5]

2.	Click **Storage** and then click **Add a storage collection**. 

	![][6] 

3.	In **Create new storage collection**, name the new table **SampleCollection** and click **Create**. 

	![][7]

4.	Now you have an empty table that can be used to store data from your app.

	![][8]

	By default, table schema is inferred when data is sent to the service in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). You can create as many tables as needed by your application. 

Next, you will complete the quickstart tutorial in the Preview Management Portal and insert data into this table. 

###<a name="create-metro-app"></a>Create a Windows 8 Metro-style app
Once you have created a mobile service instance, the Preview Management Portal will auto-generate a quickstart tutorial based on the new service configuration. You can select the type of application (for the preview only Metro-style apps are available) and the programming language for the snippets provided to you in the quickstart.

1.	In the [Preview Management Portal][Management Portal preview], click **Mobile Services**. Then click the name of the new mobile service to open the dashboard.

	![][5]

2.	In the dashboard for the selected mobile service instance, click **Quickstart**. Then select the language for the client application, in this case either **C#** or **Visual Basic**.

	![][9]

3.	Follow the instructions in the quickstart tutorial to create your first Mobile Services-based app in Visual Studio 2012 Express for Windows 8.

-	[How to: Authenticate with Windows Live][]
-	[How to: Manage table permissions][]
-	[How to: Register scripts on the server][]
-	[How to: Send push notifications][]

### <a name="managing-keys"> </a>How to: Manage keys
The Preview Management Portal can be used to obtain and generate the applicatoin key for your service. This key is presented by your app when making requests to the mobile service instance and can be used to limit access to data. For more information, see [How to: Manage table permissions][].

1.	In the [Preview Management Portal][Management Portal preview], click **Mobile Services**. Then click the name of the new mobile service to open the dashboard.

	![][5]

2.	In the dashboard, click **View Keys**. 

	![][14]

3.	In **Access Keys**, select and copy the **Application Key** value. This value is used by your app when accessing restricted table resources. 

	![][15]

	You can also choose to regenerate the application key. However, regenerating this key will break existing versions of your app and require you to update to the new key value redistribute the app.

###	<a name="how-to-add-index"> </a>How to: Add columns to the index

You can often improve the performance of your mobile service instance by adding to the table index columns that are frequently referenced in queries from your app. 

1.	In the [Preview Management Portal][Management Portal preview], click **Mobile Services**. Then click the name of the new mobile service to open the dashboard.

	![][5]

2.	In the dashboard for the selected mobile service instance, click **Storage** and then click the table to manage.

###	<a name="how-to-authenticate-mobile"> </a>How to: Authenticate with Windows Live
\[TODO\] Authentication...

### <a name="how-to-table-permissions"> </a>How to: Manage table permissions
Mobile Services allows you to specifically set the permissions for insert, update, delete, and query operations on tables. You can choose between the following permission levels:

-	**Everyone**&mdash;any client can perform the operation against the table.
-	**Anybody with the application key**&mdash;the operation requires the key distributed with the mobile app
-	**Only authenticated users**&mdash;the operation requires that the client be authenticated. For more information, see [How to: Authenticate with Windows Live].
-	**Only scripts and admins**&mdash;the operation is restricted to only service administrators and scripts registered on the server. For more information, see [How to: Register scripts on the server].

1.	In the [Preview Management Portal][Management Portal preview], click **Mobile Services**. Then click the name of the new mobile service to open the dashboard.

	![][5]

2.	In the dashboard for the selected mobile service instance, click **Storage** and then click the table to manage.

	![][10]

3.	Click **Permissions** and select the required permission level for each table operation from the drop-down list boxes. When done, click **Save**.

	![][12]


###	<a name="how-to-register-scripts-mobile"> </a>How to: Register scripts on the server
With Mobile Services, you can register JavaScript "scriptlets" against specific table operations. The scriptlet is executed whenever the table operation occurs. This enables you to inject business logic, such as logging or notifications, into your service based on data access events.

1.	In the [Preview Management Portal][Management Portal preview], click **Mobile Services**. Then click the name of the new mobile service to open the dashboard.

	![][5]

2.	In the dashboard for the selected mobile service instance, click **Storage** and then click the table to manage.

	![][10]

3.	Click **Scripts** and select the table operation that will invoke the script. Then type or paste your JavaScript code into the code editor window and click **Save**.

	![][13]

	The code editor will highlight any apparent problems with your code syntax. However, the code editor does not validate the script before saving.
