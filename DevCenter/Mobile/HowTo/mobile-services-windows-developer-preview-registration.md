# Windows Developer Preview registration steps for Mobile Services

This topic shows you how to complete the [Get started with authentication] and [Get started with push notifications] tutorials by using the [Windows Push Notifications & Live Connect] page. The specific registration steps depend on the feature for which you are registering:

- [Register your app for authentication]
- [Register your app for push notifications]

<div class="dev-callout"><b>Note</b>
<p>Because the pre-release site shown in this topic will be discontinued, we recommend that you instead follow the steps for registering your app in the main tutorials.</p>
</div>

<a name="authentication"></a><h2><span class="short-header">Register for auth</span> Register for authentication</h2>

To be able to authenticate users, you must register your Windows Store app at the Live Connect Developer Center. You must then register the client secret to integrate Live Connect with Mobile Services.

1. In Visual Studio 2012 Express for Windows 8, open the project that you created when you completed the tutorial [Get started with Mobile Services].

2. In solution explorer, double-click the file **Package.appxmanifest**, click the **Packaging** tab, and then make a note of the values of **Package display name** and **Publisher**.

  You will need these values to register your app.

3. Navigate to the [Windows Push Notifications & Live Connect] page, log on with your Microsoft account, if needed, and then follow the instructions to register your app.

4. Make a copy of the **Package name** value generated by the site after you have successfully registered your app.

   ![][6] 

3. Click **Edit settings**, then **API Settings** and make a note of the value of **Client secret**. 

   ![][7]

   You must provide this value to Mobile Services to be able to use Live Connect for authentication. 

    <div class="dev-callout"><b>Security Note</b>
	<p>The client secret is an important security credential. Do not share the client secret with anyone or distribute it with your app.</p>
    </div>

4. In **Redirect domain**, enter the URL of your mobile service from Step 7, and then click **Save**.

6. Back in the Management Portal, click the **Identity** tab, enter the **Client secret** obtained from Live Connect, and click **Save**.
