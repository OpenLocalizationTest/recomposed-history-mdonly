This topic walks you through the steps to create a new table in Windows Azure Mobile Services and add Mobile Services support to a Visual Studio 2012 Express for Windows 8 project.

	<b>Note</b> 
	<p>When you complete this topic, you will have a project that is equivalent to the ToDo sample project generated by the Mobile Services quickstart.</p> 
	</div>

3.	In **Create new storage collection**, name the new table **SampleCollection** and click **Create**.

	By default, table schema is inferred when data is sent to the service in JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). You can create as many tables as needed by your application.
