# Work with server scripts in Mobile Services
 
In Windows Azure Mobile Services, you can define custom business logic as JavaScript code that's stored and executed on the server. This code, which is referred to as a *server script*, is either registered to an insert, read, update, or delete operation on a given table or is assigned to a scheduled job. Server scripts are optional: if the default operations are sufficient, then you do not have to include them.

Every server script has a main function, and may have optional helper functions. Even though a server script may have been been created for a specific table, it can also reference other tables in the same database. The signature of the main function depends on whether the script is registered to a table operation or is run as a scheduled job.

<div class="dev-callout"><strong>Note</strong>
<p>Mobile Services does not preserve state between script executions. Because a new global context is created every time a script is run, any state variables that are defined in the script are reinitialized. If you want to store state from one request to another, create a table in your mobile service, and then read and write the state to the table. For more information, see <a href="#access-tables">How to: Access tables from scripts</a>.</p>
</div> 

<h2><a name="table-scripts"></a><span class="short-header">Table scripts</span>Table operation scripts</h2>

A table operation script is a server script that is registered to an operation on a table--insert, read, update, or delete. The name of the script must match the kind of operation for which it is registered. Only one script can be registered for a given table operation. The script is executed every time that the given operation is invoked by a REST request--for example, when a POST request is received to insert an item into the table.

You write table operation scripts if you need to enforce customized business logic when the operation is executed. For example, the following script rejects insert operations where the string length of the `text` field is greater than ten characters: 

	function insert(item, user, request) {
	    if (item.text.length > 10) {
	        request.respond(statusCodes.BAD_REQUEST, 'Text length must be less than 10 characters');
	    } else {
	        request.execute();
	    }
	}

A table script function always takes three arguments.

The first argument varies depending on the table operation. 


- For inserts and updates, it is an **item** object, which is a JSON representation of the row being affected by the operation. This allows you to access column values by name, for example, *item.Owner*, where *Owner* is one of the names in the JSON representation.
- For a delete, it is the ID of the record to delete. 
- And for a read, it is a [query object] that specifies the rowset to return.

The second argument is always a [user object][User object] that represents the user that submitted the request. 

The third argument is always a [request object][Request object], by which you can control execution of the requested operation and the response that's sent to the client.

Here are the canonical main-function signatures for the table operations: 

+ [Insert][insert function]: `function insert (item, user, request) { … }`
+ [Update][update function]: `function update (item, user, request) { … }`
+ [Delete][delete function]: `function del (id, user, request) { … }`
+ [Read][read function]: `function read (query, user, request) { … }`


<div class="dev-callout"><strong>Note</strong>
<p>A function that's registered to the delete operation must be named <em>del</em> because delete is a reserved keyword in JavaScript. </p>
</div> 

###<a name="register-table-scripts"></a>How to: Register table scripts

There are two ways to register server scripts against table operations. 

+ In the [Windows Azure Management Portal][Management Portal] in the **Scripts** tab for a given table in the **Data** tab. This illustration shows the default code for an insert script for the `TodoItem` table. You can override this code with your own custom business logic.

	![1][]
	
	For more information about how to do this, see [Validate and modify data in Mobile Services by using server scripts]. 

+ In the Windows Azure command-prompt tool. The following command uploads a script named `todoitem.insert.js` from the `table` subfolder:

		~$azure mobile script upload todolist table/todoitem.insert.js
		info:    Executing command mobile script upload
		info:    mobile script upload command OK

	For more information, see [Commands to manage Windows Azure Mobile Services]. 

###<a name="execute-operation"></a>How to: Define table scripts

A table operation script must call at least one of the following functions of the [request object] to make sure that the client receives a response. 
 
+ **execute function**: The operation is completed as requested and the standard response is returned.
 
+ **respond function**: A custom response is returned.

<div class="dev-callout"><strong>Important</strong>
<p>When a script has a code path in which neither <b>execute</b> nor <b>respond</b> is invoked, the operation may become unresponsive.</p></div>

The following script calls the **execute** function to complete the data operation requested by the client: 

	function insert(item, user, request) { 
	    request.execute(); 
	}

In this example, the item is inserted into the database and the appropriate status code is returned to the user. 

When the **execute** function is called, the `item`, [query][query object], or `id` value that was passed as the first argument into the script function is used to perform the operation. For an insert, update or query operation, you can modify the item or query before you call **execute**: 

	function insert(item, user, request) { 
	    item.scriptComment =
			'this was added by a script and will be saved to the database'; 
	    request.execute(); 
	} 
 
	function update(item, user, request) { 
	    item.scriptComment = 
			'this was added by a script and will be saved to the database'; 
	    request.execute(); 
	} 

	function read(query, user, request) { 
		// Only return records for the current user 	    
		query.where({ userid: user.userId}); 
	    request.execute(); 
	}
 
<div class="dev-callout"><strong>Note</strong>
<p>In a delete script, changing the value of the supplied userId variable does not affect which record gets deleted.</p>
</div>

For more examples, see [Read and write data], [Modify the request] and [Validate data].


###<a name="override-response"></a>How to: Override the default response

You can also use a script to implement validation logic that can override the default response behavior. If validation fails, just call the **respond** function instead of the **execute** function and write the response to the client: 

	function insert(item, user, request) {
	    if (item.userId !== user.userId) {
	        request.respond(statusCodes.FORBIDDEN, 
	        'You may only insert records with your userId.');
	    } else {
	        request.execute();
	    }
	}

In this example, the request is rejected when the inserted item does not have a `userId` property that matches the `userId` of the [user object] that's supplied for the authenticated client. In this case, a database operation (*insert*) does not occur, and a response that has a 403 HTTP status code and a custom error message is returned to the client. For more examples, see [Modify the response].

###<a name="override-success"></a>How to: Override execute success

By default in a table operation, the **execute** function writes responses automatically. However, you can pass two optional parameters to the execute function that override its behavior on success and/or on error.

By passing in a **success** handler when you call execute, you can modify the results of a query before you write them to the response. The following example calls `execute({ success: function(results) { … })` to perform additional work after data is read from the database but before the response is written:

	function read(query, user, request) {
	    request.execute({
	        success: function(results) {
	            results.forEach(function(r) {
	                r.scriptComment = 
	                'this was added by a script after querying the database';
	            });
	            request.respond();
	        }
	    });
	}

When you provide a **success** handler to the **execute** function, you must also call the **respond** function as part of the **success** handler so that the runtime knows that the script has completed and that a response can be written. When you call **respond** without passing any arguments, Mobile Services generates the default response. 

<div class="dev-callout"><strong>Note</strong>
<p>You can call <strong>respond</strong> without arguments to invoke the default response only after you first call the <strong>execute</strong> function.</p></div>
 
###<a name="override-error"></a>How to: Override default error handling


The **execute** function can fail if there is a loss of connectivity to the database, an invalid object, or an incorrect query. By default when an error occurs, server scripts log the error and write an error result to the response. Because Mobile Services provides default error handling, you don't have to handle errors that may occur in the service. 

You can override the default error handling by implementing explicit error handling if you want a particular compensating action or when you want to use the global console object to write more detailed information to the log. Do this by supplying an **error** handler to the **execute** function:

	function update(item, user, request) { 
	  request.execute({ 
	    error: function(err) { 
	      // Do some custom logging, then call respond. 
	      request.respond(); 
	    } 
	  }); 
	}
 

When you provide an error handler, Mobile Services returns an error result to the client when **respond** is called.

You can also provide both a **success** and an **error** handler if you wish.

###<a name="access-headers"></a>How to: Access custom parameters

When you send a request to your mobile service, you can include custom parameters in the URI of the request to instruct your table operation scripts how to process a given request. You then modify your script to inspect the parameter to determine the processing path.

For example, the following URI for a POST request tells the service to not permit the insertion of a new *TodoItem* that has the same text value:

		https://todolist.azure-mobile.net/tables/TodoItem?duplicateText=false


These custom query parameters are accessed as JSON values from the **parameters** property of the [request object]. The **request** object is supplied by Mobile Services to any function registered to a table operation. The following server script for the insert operation checks the value of the `duplicateText` parameter before the insert operation is run:

		function insert(item, user, request) {
		    var todoItemTable = tables.getTable('TodoItem');
		    // Check the supplied custom parameter to see if
		    // we should allow duplicate text items to be inserted.		   
		    if (request.parameters.duplicateText === 'false') {
		        // Find all existing items with the same text
		        // and that are not marked 'complete'. 
		        todoItemTable.where({
		            text: item.text,
		            complete: false
		        }).read({
		            success: insertItemIfNotComplete
		        });
		    } else {
		        request.execute();
		    }

		    function insertItemIfNotComplete(existingItems) {
		        if (existingItems.length > 0) {
		            request.respond(statusCodes.CONFLICT, 
                        "Duplicate items are not allowed.");
		        } else {
		            // Insert the item as normal. 
		            request.execute();
		        }
		    }
		}

Note that in **insertItemIfNotComplete** the **execute** function of the [request object] is invoked to insert the item when there is no duplicate text; otherwise the **respond** function is invoked to notify the client of the duplicate. 

Note the syntax of the call to the **success** function in the above code:

 		        }).read({
		            success: insertItemIfNotComplete
		        });

In JavaScript it is a compact version of the lengthier equivalent: 

		success: function(results) 
		{ 
			insertItemIfNotComplete(results); 
		}


###<a name="work-with-users"></a>How to: Work with users

In Windows Azure Mobile Services, you can use an identity provider to authenticate users. For more information, see [Get started with authentication]. When an authenticated user invokes a table operation, Mobile Services uses the [user object] to supply information about the user to the registered script function. The **userId** property can be used to store and retrieve user-specific information. The following example sets the owner property of an item based on the userId of an authenticated user:

	function insert(item, user, request) {
	    item.owner = user.userId;
	    request.execute();
	}

The next example adds an additional filter to the query based on the **userId** of an authenticated user. This filter restricts the result to only items that belong to the current user:  

	function read(query, user, request) {
	    query.where({
	        owner: user.userId
	    });
	    request.execute();
	}


<h2><a name="scheduler-scripts"></a><span class="short-header">Scheduler scripts</span>How to: Define scheduled job scripts</h2>

A server script can be assigned to a job that's defined in the Mobile Services Scheduler. These scripts belong to the job and are executed according to the job schedule. (You can also use the [Management Portal] to run jobs on demand.) A script that defines a scheduled job has no parameters because Mobile Services doesn't pass it any data; it's executed as a regular JavaScript function and doesn't interact with Mobile Services directly. 

You define scheduled jobs  in the [Windows Azure Management Portal][Management Portal] in the **Script** tab in the scheduler:

![2][]

For more information about how to do this, see [Schedule backend jobs in Mobile Services]. 

<!--There are two ways to create scheduled jobs. 

+ In the [Windows Azure Management Portal][Management Portal] in the **Scheduler** tab. For an example of how to do this, see the tutorial [Schedule backend jobs in Mobile Services]. 

+ From the command prompt using the Windows Azure command line tool. For more information, see [Commands to manage Windows Azure Mobile Services].  -->

<h2><a name="access-tables"></a><span class="short-header">Access tables</span>How to: Access tables from scripts</h2>

Your table operation scripts have default access only to the table the script is defined on, and scheduled scripts have no default access to a table. But in many scenarios, you need data from other tables: for example, you might want to examine entries in a permissions table or store audit data. You might also want to use tables to preserve state between script executions. 

You can get access to other tables from your script by using the [tables object]. The **getTable** function returns a [table object] instance that's a proxy for accessing the requested table. You can then call functions on the proxy to access and change data. This line of code gets a proxy for the *TodoItems* table:

		var todoItemsTable = tables.getTable('TodoItems');

Once you have a [table object], you can call one or more table operation functions: insert, update, delete or read. This example reads user permissions from a permissions table:

	function insert(item, user, request) {
		var permissionsTable = tables.getTable('permissions');
	
		permissionsTable
			.where({ userId: user.userId, permission: 'submit order'})
			.read({ success: checkPermissions });
			
		function checkPermissions(results) {
			if(results.length > 0) {
				// Permission record was found. Continue normal execution.
				request.execute();
			} else {
				console.log('User %s attempted to submit an order without permissions.', user.userId);
				request.respond(statusCodes.FORBIDDEN, 'You do not have permission to submit orders.');
			}
		}
	}


The next example writes auditing information to an **audit** table:

	function update(item, user, request) {
		request.execute({ success: insertAuditEntry });
		
		function insertAuditEntry() {
			var auditTable = tables.getTable('audit');
			var audit = {
				record: 'checkins',
				recordId: item.id,
				timestamp: new Date(),
				values: JSON.stringify(item)
			};
			auditTable.insert(audit, {
				success: function() {
					// Write to the response now that all data operations are complete
					request.respond();
				}
			});
		}
	}

A final example is in the code sample here: [How to: Access custom parameters].

<h2><a name="TSQL"></a><span class="short-header">Raw TSQL</span>Using raw TSQL to access tables</h2>
You may need direct access to raw TSQL in order to carry out certain relational database operations (such as joins, invoking stored procedures, etc.) that the Mobile Services server script API does not directly support.

To do this, the [mssql object] enables you to define the operations you wish to carry out in raw TSQL. The object has three methods defined on it:

- **query**: executes a query, specified by a TSQL string; the results are returned to the **success** callback on the **options** object. The query can include parameters if the *params* parameter is present.
- **queryRaw**: like *query* except that the result set returned from the query is in a "raw" format (see example below).
- **open**: used to get a connection to your Mobile Services database, and you can then use the connection object to invoke database operations such as transactions.

These methods give you increasingly more low-level control over the query processing.


###<a name="static-query"></a>How to: Run a static query

The following query has no parameters and returns three records from the `statusupdate` table. The rowset is in standard JSON format.

		mssql.query('select top 3 * from statusupdates', {
		    success: function(results) {
		        console.log(results);
		    },
            error: function(err) {
                console.log("error is: " + err);
			}
		});


###<a name="dynamic-query"></a>How to: Run a dynamic parameterized query

The following example implements custom authorization by reading permissions for each user from the permissions table. The placeholder (?) is replaced with the supplied parameter when the query is executed.

		    var sql = "SELECT _id FROM permissions WHERE userId = ? AND permission = 'submit order'";
		    mssql.query(sql, [user.userId], {
		        success: function(results) {
		            if (results.length > 0) {
		                // Permission record was found. Continue normal execution. 
		                request.execute();
		            } else {
		                console.log('User %s attempted to submit an order without permissions.', user.userId);
		                request.respond(statusCodes.FORBIDDEN, 'You do not have permission to submit orders.');
		            }
		        },
            	error: function(err) {
                	console.log("error is: " + err);
				}	
		    });



###<a name="joins"></a>How to: Join relational tables

You can join two tables by using the **query** method of the [mssql object] to pass in the TSQL code that implements the join. Let's assume we have some items in our **ToDoItem** table and each item in the table has a **priority** property, which corresponds to a column in the table. An item may look like this:

		{ text: 'Take out the trash', complete: false, priority: 1}

Let's also assume we have an additional table called **Priority** with rows that contain a priority **number** and a text **description**. For example, the priority number 1 might have the description of "Critical", with the object looking as follows:

		{ number: 1, description: 'Critical'}

We can now replace the **priority** number in our item with the text description of the priority number. We do this with a relational join of the two tables.

		mssql.query('SELECT t.text, t.complete, p.description FROM ToDoItem as t INNER JOIN Priority as p ON t.priority = p.number', {
			success: function(results) {
				console.log(results);
			},
            error: function(err) {
                console.log("error is: " + err);
		});
	
The script joins the two tables and writes the results to the log. The resulting objects could look like this:

		{ text: 'Take out the trash', complete: false, description: 'Critical'}


###<a name="raw"></a>How to: Run a query that returns *raw* results

This example executes the query, as before, but returns the resultset in "raw" format which requires you to parse it, row by row, and column by column. A possible scenario for this is if you need access to data types that Mobile Services does not support. This code simply writes the output to the console log so you can inspect the raw format.

		mssql.queryRaw('SELECT * FROM ToDoItem', {
		    success: function(results) {
		        console.log(results);
		    },
            error: function(err) {
                console.log("error is: " + err);
			}
		});

Here is the output from running this query. It contains metadata about each column in the table, followed by a representation of the rows and columns.

		{ meta: 
		   [ { name: 'id',
		       size: 19,
		       nullable: false,
		       type: 'number',
		       sqlType: 'bigint identity' },
		     { name: 'text',
		       size: 0,
		       nullable: true,
		       type: 'text',
		       sqlType: 'nvarchar' },
		     { name: 'complete',
		       size: 1,
		       nullable: true,
		       type: 'boolean',
		       sqlType: 'bit' },
		     { name: 'priority',
		       size: 53,
		       nullable: true,
		       type: 'number',
		       sqlType: 'float' } ],
		  rows: 
		   [ [ 1, 'good idea for the future', null, 3 ],
		     [ 2, 'this is important but not so much', null, 2 ],
		     [ 3, 'fix this bug now', null, 0 ],
		     [ 4, 'we need to fix this one real soon now', null, 1 ],
		   ] }

###<a name="connection"></a>How to: Get access to a database connection

You can use the **open** method to get access to the database connection. One reason to do this might be if you need to use database transactions.

Successful execution of the **open** causes the database connection to be passed into the **success** function as a parameter. You can invoke any of the following functions on the **connection** object: *close*, *queryRaw*, *query*, *beginTransaction*, *commit*, and *rollback*.

		    mssql.open({
		        success: function(connection) {
		            connection.query(//query to execute);
		        },
	            error: function(err) {
	                console.log("error is: " + err);
				}
		    });



<h2><a name="bulk-inserts"></a><span class="short-header">Bulk inserts</span>How to: Perform Bulk Inserts</h2>

If you use a **for** or **while** loop to directly insert a large number of items (1000, for example) into a  table , you may encounter a SQL connection limit that causes some of the inserts to fail. Your request may never complete or it may return a HTTP 500 Internal Server Error.  To avoid this problem, you can insert the items in batches of 10 or so. After the first batch is inserted, submit the next batch, and so on.

By using the following script, you can set the size of a batch of records to insert in parallel. We recomend that you keep the number of records small. The function **insertItems** calls itself recursively when an async insert batch has completed. The for loop at the end inserts one record at a time, and calls **insertComplete** on success and **errorHandler** on error. **insertComplete**  controls whether **insertItems** will be called recursively for the next batch, or whether the job is done and the script should exit.

		var todoTable = tables.getTable('TodoItem');
		var recordsToInsert = 1000;
		var batchSize = 10; 
		var totalCount = 0;
		var errorCount = 0; 
		
		function insertItems() {        
		    var batchCompletedCount = 0;  
		
		    var insertComplete = function() { 
		        batchCompletedCount++; 
		        totalCount++; 
		        if(batchCompletedCount === batchSize || totalCount === recordsToInsert) {                        
		            if(totalCount < recordsToInsert) {
		                // kick off the next batch 
		                insertItems(); 
		            } else { 
		                // or we are done, report the status of the job 
		                // to the log and don't do any more processing 
		                console.log("Insert complete. %d Records processed. There were %d errors.", totalCount, errorCount); 
		            } 
		        } 
		    }; 
		
		    var errorHandler = function(err) { 
		        errorCount++; 
		        console.warn("Ignoring insert failure as part of batch.", err); 
		        insertComplete(); 
		    };
		
		    for(var i = 0; i < batchSize; i++) { 
		        var item = { text: "This is item number: " + totalCount + i }; 
		        todoTable.insert(item, { 
		            success: insertComplete, 
		            error: errorHandler 
		        }); 
		    } 
		} 
		
		insertItems(); 


The entire code sample, and accompanying discussion, can be found in this [blog posting](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/jpsanders/archive/2013/03/20/server-script-to-insert-table-items-in-windows-azure-mobile-services.aspx). If you use this code, you can adapt it to your specific situation, and thoroughly test it.



<h2><a name="JSON-types"></a><span class="short-header">Map JSON types</span>How to: Map JSON types to database types</h2>

The collections of data types on the client and in a Mobile Services database table are different. Sometimes they map easily to one another, and other times they don't. Mobile Services performs a number of type transformations in the mapping:

- The client language-specific types are serialized into JSON.
- The JSON representation is translated into JavaScript before it appears in server scripts.
- The JavaScript data types are converted to SQL database types when saved using the [tables object].

The transformation from client schema into JSON varies across platforms.  JSON.NET is used in Windows Store and Windows Phone clients. The Android client uses the gson library.  The iOS client uses the NSJSONSerialization class. The default serialization behavior of each of these libraries is used, except that date objects are converted to JSON strings that contain the date that's encoded by using ISO 8601.

When you are writing server scripts that use [insert], [update], [read] or [delete] functions, you can access the JavaScript representation of your data. Mobile Services uses the Node.js’s deserialization function ([JSON.parse](http://es5.github.io/#x15.12)) to transform JSON on the wire into JavaScript objects. However Mobile Services does  a transformation to extract **Date** objects from ISO 8601 strings.

When you use the [tables object] or the [mssql object], or just let your table scripts execute, the deserialized JavaScript objects are inserted into your SQL database. In that process, object properties are mapped to T-SQL types:

<table border="1">
<tr>
<td>JavaScript property</td>
<td>T-SQL type</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Number</td>
<td>Float(53)</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Boolean</td>
<td>Bit</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Date</td>
<td>DateTimeOffset(3)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>String</td>
<td>Nvarchar(max)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Buffer</td>
<td>Not supported</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Object</td>
<td>Not supported</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Array</td>
<td>Not supported</td>
</tr><tr>
<td>Stream</td>
<td>Not supported</td>
</tr>
</table> 



<h2><a name="modules-helper-functions"></a><span class="short-header">Modules and helpers</span>How to: Leverage modules and helper functions</h2>

Mobile Services exposes a set of modules that scripts can load by using the global **require** function. For example, a script can require **request** to make HTTP requests: 

	function update(item, user, request) { 
	    var httpRequest = require('request'); 
	    httpRequest('http://www.google.com', function(err, response, body) { 
	    	... 
	    }); 
	} 

Some of these modules are provided by Mobile Services, but others are built-in Node.js modules. The following useful modules are available to your scripts when they are loaded by using the global **require** function:

+ **azure**: Exposes the functionality of the Windows Azure SDK for Node.js. For more information, see the [Windows Azure SDK for Node.js]. 

+ **crypto**: Provides crypto functionality of OpenSSL. For more information, see the [Node.js documentation][crypto API].

+ **path**: Contains utilities for working with file paths. For more information, see the [Node.js documentation][path API].

+ **querystring**: Contains utilities for working with query strings. For more information, see the [Node.js documentation][querystring API].
 
+ **request**: Sends HTTP requests to external REST services, such as Twitter and Facebook. For more information, see [Send HTTP request].
 
+ **sendgrid**: Sends email by using the Sendgrid email service in Windows Azure. For more information, see [Send email from Mobile Services with SendGrid].
 
+ **url**: Contains utilities to parse and resolve URLs. For more information, see the [Node.js documentation][url API].

+ **util**: Contains various utilities, such as string formatting and object type checking. For more information, see the [Node.js documentation][util API]. 

+ **zlib**: Exposes compression functionality, such as gzip and deflate. For more information, see the [Node.js documentation][zlib API]. 

<div class="dev-callout"><strong>Note</strong>
<p>Some Node.js modules might be disallowed. When you try to require a disallowed module, a runtime error occurs.</p></div>

In addition to requiring modules, server scripts can also include optional helper functions. In the following example, a table script is registered to the insert operation, which includes the helper function **handleUnapprovedItem**:


	function insert(item, user, request) {
	    if (!item.approved) {
	        handleUnapprovedItem(item, request);
	    } else {
	        request.execute();
	    }
	}
	
	function handleUnapprovedItem(item, request) {
	    // Implementation 
	}
 
In a script, table functions must be declared after the main function. 

<div class="dev-callout"><strong>Note</strong>
<p>You must declare all variables in your script. Undeclared variables cause an error.</p></div>

<h2><a name="write-to-logs"></a><span class="short-header">Writing to logs</span>How to: Write output to the mobile service logs</h2>

By default, Mobile Services writes errors that occur during service script execution to the service logs. Your scripts can also write to the logs. Writing to logs is great way to debug your scripts and validate that they are behaving as desired. To write to the logs, use the global [console object]. Use the **log** or **info** function to log information-level warnings. The **warning** and **error** functions log their respective levels, which are called-out in the logs. 

<div class="dev-callout"><strong>Note</strong>
<p>To view the logs for your mobile service, log on to the <a href="https://manage.windowsazure.com/">Management Portal</a>, select your mobile service, and then choose the <strong>Logs</strong> tab.</p></div>

You can also use the logging functions of the [console object] to format your messages using parameters. The following example supplies a JSON object as a parameter to the message string:

	function insert(item, user, request) {
	    console.log("Inserting item '%j' for user '%j'.", item, user);  
	    request.execute();
	}

Notice that the string `%j` is used as the placeholder for a JSON object and that parameters are supplied in sequential order.
