<h2 id="create_app">Create a PHP Application</h2>
A PHP application that uses the Twilio service and is running in Windows Azure is no different than any other PHP application that uses the Twilio service. While Twilio services are REST-based and can be called from PHP in several ways, this article will focus on how to use Twilio services with [Twilio library for PHP from Github][twilio_php]. For more information about using the Twilio library for PHP, see [http://readthedocs.org/docs/twilio-php/en/latest/index.html][twilio_lib_docs].

Detailed instructions for building and deploying a Twilio/PHP application to Windows Azure are available at [How to Make a Phone Call Using Twilio in a PHP Application on Windows Azure][howto_phonecall_php].

<h2 id="configure_app">Configure Your Application to Use Twilio Libraries</h2>
You can configure your application to use the Twilio library for PHP in two ways:

1. Download the Twilio library for PHP from Github ([https://github.com/twilio/twilio-php][twilio_php]) and add the **Services** directory to your application.

	-OR-

2. Install the  Twilio library for PHP as a PEAR package. It can be installed with the following commands:

		$ pear channel-discover twilio.github.com/pear
		$ pear install twilio/Services_Twilio

Once you have installed the Twilio library for PHP, you can then add a **require_once** statement at the top of your PHP files to reference the library:

    	require_once 'Services/Twilio.php';

For more information, see [https://github.com/twilio/twilio-php/blob/master/README.md][twilio_github_readme].

<h2 id="howto_make_call">How to: Make an outgoing call</h2>
The following shows how to make an outgoing call using the **Services_Twilio** class. This code also uses a Twilio-provided site to return the Twilio Markup Language (TwiML) response. Substitute your values for the **From** and **To** phone numbers, and ensure that you verify the **From** phone number for your Twilio account prior to running the code.

	// Include the Twilio PHP library.
	require_once 'Services/Twilio.php';

	// Library version.
	$version = "2010-04-01"

	// Set your account ID and authentication token.
	$sid = "your_twilio_account_sid";
	$token = "your_twilio_authentication_token";

	// The number of the phone initiating the the call.
	// (Must be previously validated with Twilio.)
	$from_number = "NNNNNNNNNNN";

	// The number of the phone receiving call.
	$to_number = "NNNNNNNNNNN";

	// Use the Twilio-provided site for the TwiML response.
    $url = "http://twimlets.com/message";
	
	// The phone message text.
	$message = "Hello world.";

	// Create the call client.
	$client = new Services_Twilio($sid, $token, $version);

	//Make the call.
	try
	{
		$call = $client->account->calls->create(
			$from_number, 
			$to_number,
  			$url.'?Message='.urlencode($message)
		);
	}
	catch (Exception $e) 
	{
		echo 'Error: ' . $e->getMessage();
	}

As mentioned, this code uses a Twilio-provided site to return the TwiML response. You could instead use your own site to provide the TwiML response; for more information, see [How to Provide TwiML Responses from Your Own Website](#howto_provide_twiml_responses).

<h2 id="howto_send_sms">How to: Send an SMS message</h2>
The following shows how to send an SMS message using the **Services_Twilio** class. The **From** number, **4155992671**, is provided by Twilio for trial accounts to send SMS messages. The **To** number must be verified for your Twilio account prior to running the code.

	// Include the Twilio PHP library.
	require_once 'Services/Twilio.php';

	// Library version.
	$version = "2010-04-01"

	// Set your account ID and authentication token.
	$sid = "your_twilio_account_sid";
	$token = "your_twilio_authentication_token";


    $from_number = "4155992671"; // With trial account, texts can only be sent from this number.
	$to_number = "NNNNNNNNNNN";
	$message = "Hello world.";

	// Create the call client.
	$client = new Services_Twilio($sid, $token, $version);

	// Send the SMS message.
	try
	{
		$client->account->sms_messages->create($from_number, $to_number, $message);
	}
	catch (Exception $e) 
	{
		echo 'Error: ' . $e->getMessage();
	}

<h2 id="howto_provide_twiml_responses">How to: Provide TwiML Responses from your own Web site</h2>
When your application initiates a call to the Twilio API, Twilio will send your request to a URL that is expected to return a TwiML response. The example above uses the Twilio-provided URL [http://twimlets.com/message][twimlet_message_url]. (While TwiML is designed for use by Web services, you can view the TwiML in your browser. For example, click [http://twimlets.com/message][twimlet_message_url] to see an empty `<Response>` element; as another example, click [http://twimlets.com/message?Message%5B0%5D=Hello%20World][twimlet_message_url_hello_world] to see a `<Response>` element that contains a `<Say>` element.)

Instead of relying on the Twilio-provided URL, you can create your own URL site that returns HTTP responses. You can create the site in any language that returns HTTP responses; this topic assumes youâ€™ll be hosting the URL in a PHP page.

The following PHP page results in a TwiML response that says **Hello World** on the call.

    <?php    
		header("content-type: text/xml");    
		echo "<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n";
	?>
	<Response>    
		<Say>Hello world.</Say>
	</Response>

As you can see from the example above, the TwiML response is simply an XML document. The Twilio library for PHP contains classes that will generate TwiML for you. The example below produces the equivalent response as shown above, but uses the **Services_Twilio_Twiml** class in the Twilio library for PHP:

	require_once('Services/Twilio.php');
	
	$response = new Services_Twilio_Twiml();
	$response->say("Hello world.");
	print $response;

For more information about TwiML, see [https://www.twilio.com/docs/api/twiml][twiml_reference]. 

Once you have your PHP page set up to provide TwiML responses, use the URL of the PHP page as the URL passed into the  `Services_Twilio->account->calls->create`  method. For example, if you have a Web application named **MyTwiML** deployed to a Windows Azure hosted service, and the name of the PHP page is **mytwiml.php**, the URL can be passed to  **Services_Twilio->account->calls->create**  as shown in the following example:

	require_once 'Services/Twilio.php';

	$sid = "your_twilio_account_sid";
	$token = "your_twilio_authentication_token";
	$from_number = "NNNNNNNNNNN";
	$to_number = "NNNNNNNNNNN";
    $url = "http://<your_hosted_service>.cloudapp.net/MyTwiML/mytwiml.php";

	$client = new Services_Twilio($sid, $token, "2010-04-01");

	try
	{
		$call = $client->account->calls->create(
			$from_number, 
			$to_number,
  			$url.'?Message='.urlencode($message)
		);
	}
	catch (Exception $e) 
	{
		echo 'Error: ' . $e->getMessage();
	}
