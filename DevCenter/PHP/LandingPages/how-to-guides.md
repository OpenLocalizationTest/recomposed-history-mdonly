## Data Management and Integration ##

### [Blob Service](/en-us/develop/php/how-to-guides/blob-storage/ "Blob Service") ###
Blobs are the simplest way to store large amounts of unstructured text or binary data such as video, audio and images. The Windows Azure Blob Service is an ISO 27001 certified managed service that can auto-scale to meet massive volume demands (up to 100 terabytes per container), and is accessible from virtually anywhere via REST and managed API’s. This guide will show you how to use the [PHP Client Libraries for Windows Azure][client-libs] to perform common scenarios, such as **uploading**, **listing**, **downloading**, and **deleting** blobs.

### [Table Service](/en-us/develop/php/how-to-guides/table-storage/ "Table Service") ###
Tables offer NoSQL capabilities for applications that require storage of large amounts of loosely structured data. The Windows Azure Table Service is an ISO 27001 certified managed service that can auto scale to meet massive volume demands (upto 100 terabytes per table), and is accessible from virtually anywhere via REST and managed API’s. This guide will show you how to use the [PHP Client Libraries for Windows Azure][client-libs] to perform common scenarios, such as **creating and deleting tables**, and **inserting**, **querying**, and **deleting entities** in a table.

### [Queue Service](/en-us/develop/php/how-to-guides/queue-storage/ "Queue Service") ###
Queues feature a simple REST-based Get/Put/Peek interface, providing reliable, persistent messaging within and between services. The Windows Azure Queue Service is an ISO 27001 certified managed service that can auto scale to meet massive volume demands (upto 100 terabytes per queue), and is accessible from virtually anywhere via REST and managed API’s. This guide will show you how to use the [PHP Client Libraries for Windows Azure][client-libs] to perform common scenarios, such as **creating and deleting queues**, and **inserting**, **peeking**, **getting**, and **deleting queue messages**.

### [Service Bus Queues](/en-us/develop/net/how-to-guides/service-bus-queues/ "Service Bus Queues") ###
Service Bus Queues offer simple first in, first out guaranteed message delivery and supports a range of standard protocols (REST, AMQP, WS*) and API’s to put/pull messages on/off a queue. 

### [Service Bus Topics](/en-us/develop/net/how-to-guides/service-bus-topics/ "Service Bus Topics") ###
Service Bus Topics deliver messages to multiple subscriptions and easily fan out message delivery at scale to downstream systems.

### [Service Bus Relay](/en-us/develop/net/how-to-guides/service-bus-relay/ "Service Bus Relay") ###
Service Bus Relay solves the challenges of communicating between on-premises applications and the outside world by allowing on-premises web services to project public endpoints. Systems can then access these web services, which continue to run on-premises from anywhere on the planet.





### [SQL Database](/en-us/develop/net/how-to-guides/sql-azure/ "SQL Database") ###
For applications that need a full featured relational database-as-a-service, Windows Azure offers SQL Database, formerly known as SQL Azure Database. SQL Database offers a high-level of interoperability, enabling customers to build applications using many of the major development frameworks.
