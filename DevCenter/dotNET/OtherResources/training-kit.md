The Windows Azure Training Kit includes a comprehensive set of technical
content designed to help you learn how to use Windows Azure. The kit
includes hands-on labs, presentations, demos, and code samples for every
aspect of developing applications for Windows Azure. You can use the
resources in the training kit to teach yourself or train others.

You can [download and install the kit][] on Microsoft Download Center.
The kit downloads as a .EXE file. Once it downloads, install the
training kit on your local computer by running the .EXE file. After the
training kit installs, the home page is displayed in your web browser.

The Web Installer is a small application that allows you to search and
download the specific training kit resources you want. As new or updated
