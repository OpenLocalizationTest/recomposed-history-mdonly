# Continuous Delivery of a Cloud Service by Using Team Foundation Service Preview

Microsoft Team Foundation Service Preview is a cloud-hosted service version of Microsoft’s popular Team Foundation Server software that provides highly customizable source code and build management, agile development and team process workflow, issue and work item tracking, and more.  You can configure your Team Foundation Service team projects to automatically build and deploy to Windows Azure websites or cloud services.  

This tutorial assumes you have Visual Studio 2012 RC installed. If you don’t already have Visual Studio 2012 RC, download it [here](http://www.microsoft.com/visualstudio/11/en-us/downloads).

To set up a cloud service to automatically build and deploy to Windows Azure by using Team Foundation Service Preview, follow these steps:

1.	Create a TFS account by navigating to [http://kudutfs.cloudapp.net](http://kudutfs.cloudapp.net).
 
2.	Create a team project by navigating to your TFS account page. Your account will have the form: http://&lt;username&gt;.kudutfs.cloudapp.net.  You will need to sign-in using a regular Microsoft account (not the same as the test account you used to log in to the Azure portal).<br/>
![][1]

3. Select Create a Team Project. Give a name and description to your project and click the “Create Project” button.<br/>
![][2]

4. When project creation is done, click the “Navigate to Project” button.<br/>
![][3]

5. Click the “Open new instance in Visual Studio” link to automatically launch Visual Studio connected to your team project.<br/>
![][4]

6. In Visual Studio, open the Windows Azure Application solution for your cloud service.

7. Open the shortcut menu for the solution, and select Add Solution to Source Control.<br/>
![][5]

8. Accept or change the defaults and choose the OK button.<br/>
![][6]

9. Open the shortcut menu for the solution, and choose Check In.<br/>
![][7]

10. In the Pending Changes area of Team Explorer, type a comment for the check-in and choose the Check In button.<br/>
![][8]
<br/>
Note: You may need to repeat this again after your initial check-in, to “Include All” files.  Click the “Include All” link and click the “Check-in” button again.<br/>
![][9]

11. Now that you have a TFS team project with some source code in it, you are ready to connect your team project to Azure.  In the Azure portal, click “Set up TFS publishing” on the Quickstart page (or Dashboard’s “Quick Glance” section).<br/>
![][10]

12. In the wizard, type the name of your TFS account in the textbox and click the “Authorize Now” link.<br/>
![][11]

13. In the OAuth pop-up dialog, click “Accept” to authorize Windows Azure to configure your team project in TFS.<br/>
![][12]

14. When authorization succeeds, you should see a dropdown containing a list of your TFS team projects.  Select the name of team project that you created in the previous steps, and click the wizard’s Finish button.<br/>
![][13]

15. When your project is linked, you will see some instructions for checking in changes to your TFS team project.  On your next check-in, TFS will build and deploy your project to Windows Azure.  Try this now by clicking the “Launch Visual Studio” link (or the equivalent “Visual Studio” button in the command-bar).<br/>
![][14]

16. In Visual Studio’s Team Explorer, click the “Source Control Explorer” link.<br/>
![][15]

17. Navigate to your solution file and open it.<br/>
![][16]

18. In Solution Explorer, open up a file and change it. For example, change the file _Layout.cshtml under the Views\Shared folder in an MVC4 web role.<br/>
![][17]

19. Edit the logo for the site and hit Ctrl+S to save the file.<br/>
![][18]

20. In Team Explorer, choose the Pending Changes link.<br/>
![][19]

21. Type in a comment and choose the Check In button.<br/>
![][20]

22. Choose the Home button to return to the Team Explorer home page.<br/>
![][21]

23. Choose the Builds link to view the builds in progress.<br/>
![][22]
<br/>
You should see that a build has been triggered for your check-in.<br/>
![][23]

24. Double-click the name of the build in-progress to view a detailed log as the build progresses.<br/>
![][24]

24. While the build is in-progress, take a look at the build definition that was created when you linked TFS-Azure using the wizard.  Open the shortcut menu for the build definition and choose Edit Build Definition.<br/>
![][25]
<br/>
In the Trigger tab, you will see that the build definition is set to build on every check-in by default.<br/>
![][26]
<br/>
In the Process tab, you can see the deployment environment is set to the name of your cloud service.<br/>
![][27]

25.	By this time, your build should be completed successfully.<br/>
![][28]

26. If you double-click the build name, you should see a Build Summary, including any test results from associated unit test projects.<br/>
![][29]

27. In the [Azure Portal](http://preview.azure.com), you should see an associated deployment.<br/>
![][30]

28.	Click the “Browse” button to view your running site.<br/>
![][31]
<br/>
A new browser tab will open to reveal your running site.<br/>
![][32]

29.	If you make other changes to your project, you trigger more builds, and you will accumulate multiple deployments. The latest one marked as Active.<br/>
![][33]

30. Select an earlier deployment and click the Redeploy button to rewind your site to an earlier check-in.  Note that this will trigger a new build in TFS, and create a new entry in your deployment history.<br/>
![][34]
