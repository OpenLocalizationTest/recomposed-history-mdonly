## Data Storage and Management ##

### [Blob Service](/en-us/develop/net/how-to-guides/blob-storage/ "Blob Service") ###
Blobs are the simplest way to store large amounts of unstructured text or binary data such as video, audio and images. Blobs are an ISO 27001 certified managed service can auto-scale to meet massive volume of up to 100 terabytes and throughput and accessible from virtually anywhere via REST and managed API’s.

### [Table Service](/en-us/develop/net/how-to-guides/table-services/ "Table Service") ###
Tables offer NoSQL capabilities for applications that require storage of large amounts of unstructured data.

### [Service Bus Topics](/en-us/develop/net/how-to-guides/service-bus-topics/ "Service Bus Topics") ###
Service Bus Topics deliver messages to multiple subscriptions and easily fan out message delivery at scale to downstream systems.

### [Service Bus Relay](/en-us/develop/net/how-to-guides/service-bus-relay/ "Service Bus Relay") ###
Service Bus Relay solves the challenges of communicating between on-premises applications and the outside world by allowing on-premises web services to project public endpoints. Systems can then access these web services, which continue to run on-premises from anywhere on the planet.

## Additional Guides ##

### [Caching](/en-us/develop/net/how-to-guides/cache/) ###
