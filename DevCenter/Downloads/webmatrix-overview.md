## Publish seamlessly to Windows Azure 
With a single click to import a publish settings file from Azure, you can publish any website you’ve built straight to the cloud. No complicated settings or additional work required!

##Use your favorite web standards
You can create and edit sites built on ASP.NET, PHP, Node.js and HTML5, along with support for CSS3, JQuery and more!

##Use popular open source applications
Start from dozens of open source applications and take advantage of all the built-in features, such as getting started links, app-specific code completion and even custom features built by the community for WebMatrix.

##Do more with an all-in-one tool
Go beyond just content with support for creating and editing databases, easily building mobile sites, optimizing sites for search engines and way more!

##Open your sites directly from Windows Azure
When you’re ready to start editing the content of a Windows Azure Website, you can use the WebMatrix button to install WebMatrix and its dependencies, as well as download your site, all in a single click.

##Download your site and dependencies in a single click
You can create a copy of your remote site to edit offline by downloading it. WebMatrix will look at your content to determine what dependencies are needed. If you are running ASP.NET, PHP or Node, these will be automatically installed and configured for you. If you have a database, it will be downloaded. And if you are running a known application from the Web Application Gallery, such as WordPress or DotNetNuke, we will automatically install dependencies and make any changes needed so that it just runs locally! 

##Edit your sites remotely
In a hurry or just prefer to edit remotely? Open your site directly inside WebMatrix and edit any files.
