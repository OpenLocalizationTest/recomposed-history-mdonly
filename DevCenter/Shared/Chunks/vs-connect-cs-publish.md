1. If the subscription that you want to work with isn't in the **Choose your subscription** drop-down list, connect to your Windows Azure account by using one of the following methods. The first method is quicker and easier but connects to Windows Azure only for the duration of the Visual Studio session, for up to 8 hours. The second method enables Visual Studio to connect automatically every time you run it. For more information, see [How to Connect to Windows Azure from Visual Studio](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=324796).

   * Click **Sign In**, and then enter the credentials for your Windows Azure account.

   * In the **Choose your subscription** drop-down list, click **Manage subscriptions** in order to install a certificate that enables access to your account.

     In the **Manage Windows Azure Subscriptions** dialog box, click the **Certificates** tab, and then click **Import**. Follow the directions to download and import a subscription file (also called a *.publishsettings* file) for your Windows Azure account.

     <div class="dev-callout"><p><strong>Security Note:</strong>
     Download the subscription file to a folder outside your source code directories (for example, in the Libraries\Documents folder), and then delete it once the import has completed. A malicious user who gains access to the subscription file can edit, create, and delete your Windows Azure services.</p></div>
