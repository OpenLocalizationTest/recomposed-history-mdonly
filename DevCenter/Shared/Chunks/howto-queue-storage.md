## <a name="what-is"> </a>What is Queue Storage

Windows Azure Queue storage is a service for storing large numbers of
messages that can be accessed from anywhere in the world via
authenticated calls using HTTP or HTTPS. A single queue message can be
up to 64KB in size, a queue can contain millions of messages, up to the
100TB total capacity limit of a storage account. Common uses of Queue
storage include:

    Worker role
