   * Sign in to the Windows Azure account by entering your credentials.

     This method is quicker and easier but connects to Windows Azure only for the duration of the Visual Studio session, for up to 8 hours.

     In **Server Explorer**, click the **Connect to Windows Azure** button. An alternative is to right-click the **Windows Azure** node, and then click **Connect to Windows Azure** in the context menu.

   * Install a certificate that enables access to your account.

     This method enables Visual Studio to connect automatically every time you run it. 

     In **Server Explorer**, right-click the **Windows Azure** node, and then click **Manage Subscriptions** in the context menu. In the **Manage Windows Azure Subscriptions** dialog box, click the **Certificates** tab, and then click **Import**. Follow the directions to download and then import a subscription file (also called a *.publishsettings* file) for your Windows Azure account.

     <div class="dev-callout"><strong>Security Note:</strong>
     <p>Download the subscription file to a folder outside your source code directories (for example, in the Downloads folder), and then delete it once the import has completed. A malicious user who gains access to the suscription file can edit, create, and delete your Windows Azure services.</p></div>
