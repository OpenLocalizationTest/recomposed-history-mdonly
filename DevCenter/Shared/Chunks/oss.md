                <p>Apache Ant is a Java library and command-line tool whose mission is to drive processes described in build files as targets and extension points dependent upon each other. The main known usage of Ant is the build of Java applications. </p>
                <p>Ant supplies a number of built-in tasks allowing to compile, assemble, test and run Java applications. Ant can also be used effectively to build non Java applications, for instance C or C++ applications. More generally, Ant can be used to pilot any type of process which can be described in terms of targets and tasks.</p>

                <p>Maven, a Yiddish word meaning accumulator of knowledge, was originally started as an attempt to simplify the build processes in the Jakarta Turbine project. There were several projects each with their own Ant build files that were all slightly different and JARs were checked into CVS. We wanted a standard way to build the projects, a clear definition of what the project consisted of, an easy way to publish project information and a way to share JARs across several projects.</p>
                <p>The result is a tool that can now be used for building and managing any Java-based project. We hope that we have created something that will make the day-to-day work of Java developers easier and generally help with the comprehension of any Java-based project. </p>

User identification relies on x509 certificates, which can be provided through third party CA system.</p>
                <p>OpenSSO consists of Identity module, which acts as repository for client certificates and their corresponding users in target applications. For each target application there is an Application agent, which communicates securely with the identity module and is highly integrated with the target application. Thus, once user presents their certificate in front of any application agent, the agent itself checks it in the identity module and if there is a match – the agent sets the correct user identification for the target application.</p>
