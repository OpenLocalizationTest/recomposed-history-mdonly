  <h2>Benefits of the Windows Azure Deployment Model</h2>
  <p>In a traditional server hosting model, when you deploy an application to a host, you have to worry about patching the operating system (OS), various components, and your application code itself. In addition, you need to concern yourself with how to perform these updates with minimal downtime to your application so that it remains responsive to client requests. Windows Azure handles deployment and update issues like these automatically.</p>
  <p>Getting your application up and running on Windows Azure is easy. You simply package (zip) your application and upload it to Windows Azure along with some XML configuration files. Based on the configuration information, Windows Azure determines how many role instances (these are essentially virtual machines or VMs) to provision for each role, determines what OS version and components to put on each role instance, installs your uploaded code on each role instance, and boots them. In most cases, the role instances are up and running your code within minutes. Once initialized, the role instances report into the load balancer, which will now distribute client traffic equally to all the role instances running your Internet-facing application.</p>
  <p>Once your role instances (that is, VMs running your application code) are up and running, Windows Azure constantly monitors them to ensure high availability of your applications. If one of your application processes terminates due to an unhandled exception, Windows Azure automatically restarts your application process on the role instance. If the hardware that is running your role instance experiences a failure, Windows Azure detects this, automatically provisions a new role instance, and boots it on other hardware, again ensuring high availability for your application. Because it takes a few minutes for Windows Azure to detect the failing hardware and to provision a new role instance on other hardware, it is highly recommended that you configure your application to run at least two role instances for each unit of code you have running. This way, if one role instance experiences a problem, the load balancer directs requests to the other role instance, ensuring that clients can still reach your application.</p>
  <p>In fact, if you examine the <a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/support/sla/">Windows Azure Service Level Agreement</a>, you will come across the following text related to the compute services:</p>
  <p>We guarantee that when you deploy two or more role instances in different fault and upgrade domains your Internet facing roles will have external connectivity at least 99.95% of the time. Additionally, we will monitor all of your individual role instances and guarantee that 99.9% of the time we will detect when a role instanceâ€™s process is not running and initiate corrective action.</p>
  <p>While your application is running, Windows Azure ensures that the OS and components are patched periodically with minimal downtime to your applications. Windows Azure also offers ways to scale your application up or down, to change certificates, endpoints, configuration settings, and even to version the code for your application with little or no downtime. This article delves into all the possible deployment and update scenarios.</p>
  <a name="lifecycle">
  </a>
  <h2>Lifecycle of a Windows Azure Application</h2>
  <p>Once you have deployed your application to Windows Azure, you have many ways to manage it and the role instances on which it is running. For example, you can easily scale the number of instances for any given role up or down in order to meet business needs. You can also change configuration settings and distribute the changes out to the role instances without having to redeploy any of the code. If you discover a bug or want to add a small feature to your role code, you can upload the new code to Windows Azure and have it distribute it to the appropriate role instances. Windows Azure does this while ensuring that your application remains accessible to your customers; the details of how it does this are described later in this article.</p>
  <p>Finally, if you want to make significant changes to your code, Windows Azure offers a way for you to upload the new code and test it in a staging area while customers access the old code. Then, once you feel confident with the new code, you can move it from staging to production so that new client requests now run against the new code.</p>
  <p>The following sections describe how to perform these scenarios in detail.</p>
  <a name="scenario1">
  </a>
  <h2>Scenario #1: New Deployment</h2>
  <p>To deploy an application to Windows Azure, you must first create a <em>hosted service</em>. You can do so via the Windows Azure Management Portal, via the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsazure/gg441304.aspx">Create Hosted Service REST API</a>, or automatically from Windows Azure tooling when deploying your application. Both the Visual Studio tooling in the Windows Azure SDK for .NET and the command line tooling in the Windows Azure SDK for Node.js support creating hosted services. A hosted service allows you to select one of the six Windows Azure data centers around the world where your applications will be deployed, and also allows you to reserve a DNS prefix that clients will use to access your services. The full DNS name will be something like <em>prefix</em>.cloudapp.net. Of course, you can create a DNS record that maps your custom domain name to the Windows Azure DNS name. For more information, see the <a href="../application-model/">Windows Azure Application Model</a> article.</p>
  <p>Before you can deploy an application into the hosted service, you must package (zip) your application for your roles together into a CSPKG file. Your service definition (CSDEF) file must also be embedded into the CSPKG file. In addition, you need to have your service configuration (CSCFG) file ready. These files are discussed in the <a href="../application-model/">Windows Azure Application Model</a> article. Then, you upload these files to Windows Azure via the Windows Azure Management Portal or by calling the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsazure/ee460813.aspx">Create Deployment REST API</a>. You can alternatively deploy your application directly from Windows Azure tooling, such as the Visual Studio tooling in the Windows Azure SDK for .NET or the command line tooling in the Windows Azure SDK for Node.js. With the tooling, the underlying details of creating a CSPKG and uploading it to Windows Azure are handled for you automatically.</p>
  <p>Within a few minutes after uploading the files, Windows Azure provisions your role instances and your application is up and running. The figure below shows the CSPKG and CSCFG files that you create on your development computer. The CSPKG file contains the CSDEF file and the code for two roles. After uploading the CSPKG and CSCFG files to Windows Azure via the Service Management API, Windows Azure creates the role instances in the data center. In this example, the CSCFG file indicates that Windows Azure should create three instances of role #1 and two instances of role #2.<a id="AzureStorage" name="AzureStorage"></a></p>

  </p>
  <a name="scenario2">
  </a>
  <h2>Scenario #2: Configuration Change</h2>
  <p>Once an application is deployed and running, you can reconfigure the roles by modifying the CSCFG file in use. You can edit the CSCFG file directly using the Windows Azure Management Portal or you can upload a new CSCFG file via the Windows Azure Management Portal or by calling the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsazure/ee460809.aspx">Change Deployment Configuration REST API</a>.</p>
  <p>The most common reason to change the CSCFG file is to change the number of instances running a particular role. However, you can also change configuration setting values or certificates used by a role. If you opt out of automatic OS updates, you can also change the OS version used by all the roles. For more information about OS updates, see <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsazure/ff729422.aspx">Managing Upgrades to the Windows Azure Guest OS</a>.</p>
  <p>When scaling a roleâ€™s instances, Windows Azure adjusts the number of role instances running each roleâ€™s code. Increasing the number of instances for a role does not impact the currently running instances. If you decrease the number of instances for a role, then Windows Azure selects which instances to terminate. Note that instances being terminated are given a chance to shut down cleanly allowing them to save any data on the role instance out to more persistent storage such as SQL Azure, Blobs, or Tables.</p>
  <p>In the figure below, a new CSCFG file is uploaded to Windows Azure, indicating that role #1 should have two instances and role #2 should have one instance. Windows Azure then terminates one instance of each role.</p>
  <p>
    <img src="../../../DevCenter/Shared/media/deploying-and updating-applications-4.jpg" width="606" height="154" alt="[image]" />
  </p>
  <p>When changing configuration setting values, the applications on the role instances may have to restart in order to pick up the new configuration values. Windows Azure restarts the role instances using the in-place rolling upgrade technique described earlier. More details about this technique are also discussed in the next section.<a id="Blob" name="Blob"></a></p>
  <a name="scenario3">
  </a>
  <h2>Scenario #3: Incremental Code Upgrade</h2>
  <p>If you want to make an incremental code upgrade to a role â€” for example, to fix a bug or add a small feature â€” you can create a new CSPKG file containing the new code and upload it to Windows Azure via the Windows Azure Management Portal or by calling the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsazure/ee460793.aspx">Upgrade Deployment REST API</a>. You can alternatively deploy your application directly from Windows Azure tooling, such as the Visual Studio tooling in the Windows Azure SDK for .NET or the command line tooling in the Windows Azure SDK for Node.js. With the tooling, the underlying details of creating a CSPKG and uploading it to Windows Azure are handled for you automatically.</p>
  <p>Uploading a new CSPKG file causes Windows Azure to replace the code on just the instances running the role whose code you modified by performing an <em>in-place upgrade</em>. This means that Windows Azure will stop some of the instances running the old version of the code, upgrade the instances with the new version of the code (extracted from the CSPKG file), and then restart the instances. Once the instances running the new code have been up and running successfully (considered healthy) for approximately 15 minutes, Windows Azure will perform the same upgrade on some of the other instances still running the old version of the code. It will continue to do this until all instances are running the new version of the code. An in-place upgrade ensures that your application always has some instances available to process client requests. This also means that your application will have some instances running old versions of your code and new versions of your code simultaneously and you must ensure that your application code can handle this successfully.</p>
  <p>To ensure that all instances running a role are not down simultaneously, Windows Azure uses <em>upgrade domains (UDs)</em>. By default, an application has five upgrade domains, and Windows Azure will distribute role instances across all of these upgrade domains. For example, if you have two instances running a web role and three instances running a worker role, then Windows Azure will automatically distribute the instances across the upgrade domains as shown in the table below:</p>
  <table border="2" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="5" style="border: 2px solid #000000;">
    <tbody>
      <tr align="left" valign="top">

        <td>
          <p>
            <strong>UD #4</strong>
          </p>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr align="left" valign="top">
        <td>

        </td>
        <td>
          <p>(n/a)</p>
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr align="left" valign="top">
        <td>
          <p>Worker role<br />Instance #1</p>
        </td>
        <td>
          <p>Worker role<br />Instance #2</p>
        </td>
        <td>
          <p>Worker role<br />Instance #3</p>
        </td>
        <td>
          <p>(n/a)</p>
        </td>
        <td>
          <p>(n/a)</p>
        </td>
      </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>If you upload a CSPKG with new code for both roles, then Windows Azure will first stop all the instances in UD #0. While Windows Azure updates the code on these instances, the load balancer directs client requests to the other three instances, so your application is never completely offline. After the instances in UD #0 have the new code installed, they are restarted, and the load balancer begins directing traffic to them again. After the new instances are up and running (healthy) for approximately 15 minutes, Windows Azure stops the instances in UD #1, upgrades their code, and restarts them. Finally, after all the role instances in UD #1 have been up and running healthy for 15 minutes, Windows Azure stops the instance in UD #2, upgrades its code, and restarts it.</p>
  <p>Because of upgrade domains, you never have a role completely offline while upgrades are being performed as long as you have at least two instances running each roleâ€™s code. You specify the number of upgrade domains you want your application to have in its CSDEF file. The minimum is one (which should be avoided) and the maximum is 20.</p>
  <p>If you prefer, instead of having Windows Azure automatically walk each upgrade domain every 15 minutes, you can manually walk each upgrade domain. That is, you can upgrade the instances in one upgrade domain and then see how your new code is performing (perhaps by using Remote Desktop to access a specific role instance). Then, when you are satisfied, you can tell Windows Azure to upgrade the next upgrade domain. If you are unhappy with your code, you can also tell Windows Azure to roll back the change forcing the instances in the already-walked upgrade domains to revert back to the previous version of the code.</p>
  <a name="scenario4">
  </a>
  <h2>Scenario #4: Major Upgrade</h2>
  <p>Windows Azure also offers a way for you to make a major new release of your application without your application incurring any downtime. A major change is one in which an in-place upgrade wonâ€™t work, for example because your application canâ€™t handle having old versions and new versions of roles running side-by-side during the time it takes to upgrade all the upgrade domains. An example of this might be if you were changing the kinds of roles used within your application.</p>
  <p>To perform a major code change, youâ€™d create the new CSPKG file (containing the new version of your rolesâ€™ code) &amp; the corresponding CSCFG file. Then, youâ€™d deploy these new files into your hosted serviceâ€™s staging environment via the Windows Azure Management Portal or by calling the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsazure/ee460813.aspx">Create Deployment REST API</a>. You can alternatively deploy your application directly from Windows Azure tooling, such as the Visual Studio tooling in the Windows Azure SDK for .NET or the command line tooling in the Windows Azure SDK for Node.js. With the tooling, the underlying details of creating a CSPKG and uploading it to Windows Azure are handled for you automatically.</p>
  <p>Windows Azure deploys your new application to a new set of role instances and Windows Azure assign a globally unique identifier (GUID) as a special DNS prefix when an application is deployed to the staging environment. The new version of your application is now up and running in your desired data center and accessible for you to test at <em>guid</em>.cloudapp.net.</p>
  <p>Note that the old version of your application is still publicly available to clients at the preferred DNS prefix and that you are charged for the instances that are running your production (old) code as well as the instances that are running your staging (new) code. The figure below shows version 1.0 of your application running in the production environment and version 2.0 running in the staging environment.</p>
  <p>
    <img src="../../../DevCenter/Shared/media/deploying-and updating-applications-5.jpg" width="624" height="253" alt="[image]" />
  </p>
  <p>Once you have sufficiently tested your new code in staging using <em>guid</em>.cloudapp.net, you tell Windows Azure to put it into production by performing what is called a <em>Virtual IP (VIP) Swap</em>. This causes Windows Azure to reprogram the load balancer so that it now directs client traffic sent to <em>prefix</em>.cloudapp.net to the instances running the new version of your code. This means that clients immediately start accessing the new version of your application and no longer have access to the old version. Again, clients experience no downtime. The figure below shows how the load balancer directs traffic after a VIP Swap has been performed.</p>
  <p>
    <img src="../../../DevCenter/Shared/media/deploying-and updating-applications-6.jpg" width="621" height="251" alt="[image]" />
  </p>
  <p>Note that after you swap the VIPs, the old version of your application is still running and is now available in the staging environment at guid.cloudapp.net. While this version is still running, you are still being charged for the role instances. You can now delete the deployment containing the old version of your application to reduce charges. Alternatively, you can keep it running for some time and, if any problems appear with the new version of your application, you can swap the VIPs again making the old code accessible to clients while you fix the new version.<a id="SQLAzure" name="SQLAzure"></a></p>
