# Java Multi-Tier Application Using Service Bus Queues

Developing for Windows Azure is easy using the Eclipse IDE and the
free [Windows Azure SDK for Java](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windowsazure/hh690953%28v=VS.103%29.aspx). On completing this guide, you will have an application that uses
multiple Windows Azure resources running in your local environment and
demonstrates how a multi-tier application works.

You will learn:

-   How to enable your computer for Windows Azure development with downloads and installs
-   How to use Eclipse to develop for Windows Azure
-   How to create a multi-tier application in Windows Azure
-   How to communicate between tiers using Service Bus Queues

You will build a front-end Java Server Pages (JSP) Azure worker role that uses a back-end Java-based Azure virtual machine (VM) role to process long running jobs. You will learn how to create multi-role solutions, as well as how to use Service Bus Queues to enable inter-role communication. 

## Scenario Overview: Inter-Role Communication

To submit an order for processing, the front end UI component, needs to interact with the logic running in
the virtual machine (VM) role. This example uses Service Bus brokered messaging for
the communication between the tiers.

Using brokered messaging between the front and back-end tiers decouples the
two components. In contrast to direct messaging (that is, TCP or HTTP),
the web tier does not connect to the backend middle tier directly; instead it
pushes units of work, as messages, into the Service Bus, which reliably
retains them until the middle tier is ready to consume and process them.

The Service Bus provides two entities to support brokered messaging,
queues and topics. With queues, each message sent to the queue is
consumed by a single receiver. Topics support the publish/subscribe
pattern in which each published message is made available to each
subscription registered with the topic. Each subscription logically
maintains its own queue of messages. Subscriptions can also be
configured with filter rules that restrict the set of messages passed to
the subscription queue to those that match the filter. This example uses
Service Bus queues.

    ![][arch-overview]

This communication mechanism has several advantages over direct
messaging, namely:

-   **Temporal decoupling.** With the asynchronous messaging pattern,
    producers and consumers need not be online at the same time. Service
    Bus reliably stores messages until the consuming party is ready to
    receive them. This allows the components of the distributed
    application to be disconnected, either voluntarily, for example, for
    maintenance, or due to a component crash, without impacting the
    system as a whole. Furthermore, the consuming application may only
    need to come online during certain times of the day.

-   **Load leveling**. In many applications, system load varies over
    time whereas the processing time required for each unit of work is
    typically constant. Intermediating message producers and consumers
    with a queue means that the consuming application (the worker) only
    needs to be provisioned to accommodate average load rather than peak
    load. The depth of the queue will grow and contract as the incoming
    load varies. This directly saves money in terms of the amount of
    infrastructure required to service the application load.

-   **Load balancing.** Pull-based load balancing
    allows for optimum utilization of the worker machines even if the
    worker machines differ in terms of processing power. This pattern is often
    termed the competing consumer pattern.

The following sections discuss the code that implements this
architecture.

	<dependency>
	    <groupId>com.microsoft.windowsazure</groupId>
    	<artifactId>microsoft-windowsazure-api</artifactId>
    	<version>0.2.1</version>
	</dependency>


#### Windows Azure Plugin for Eclipse with Java

##### Prerequisites

1. Windows 7 or Windows Server 2008
2. Eclipse Helios or later

##### Installation Steps

1. Follow the directions in the previous section to install the Windows Azure Libraries for Java and the listed prerequisites.
2. Install the Windows Azure SDK.
3. In Eclipse, from the **Help** menu, select **Install New Software**.
4. Enter the site location [http://dl.windowsazure.com/eclipse](http://dl.windowsazure.com/eclipse) and press **Enter**.
5. Select all of the items to be installed and click **Finish**.

6.  Once  installation is complete, you will have everything
    necessary to start developing. The SDK includes the libraries that let you
    easily develop Windows Azure applications with Java. If you

## Create a Windows Azure Account

1.  Open a web browser, and browse to [http://www.windowsazure.com](http://www.windowsazure.com).

    To get started with a free account, click **free trial** in the upper
    right corner and follow the steps.

    ![][click-free-trial]

2.  Your account is now created. You are ready to deploy your
    application to Windows Azure!

## How to create a service bus namespace

To begin using Service Bus queues in Windows Azure, you must first
create a service namespace. A service namespace provides a scoping
container for addressing Service Bus resources within your application.

To create a service namespace:

1.  Log on to the [Windows Azure Management Portal](http://windows.azure.com) (note this is not the same portal as the Windows Azure Preview Management Portal).
2.  In the lower left navigation pane of the Management Portal, click
    **Service Bus, Access Control & Caching**.
3.  In the upper left pane of the Management Portal, click the **Service
    Bus** node, and then click the **New** button.  
    ![Service Bus Node screenshot][new-service-bus-1]
4.  In the **Create a new Service Namespace** dialog, enter a
    **Namespace**, and then to make sure that it is unique, click the
    **Check Availability** button.  
    ![Create a New Namespace screenshot][new-service-bus-2]
5.  After making sure the namespace name is available, choose the
    country or region in which your namespace should be hosted (make
    sure you use the same country/region in which you are deploying your
    compute resources), and then click the **Create Namespace** button.
    Having a compute instance is optional, and the service bus can be
    consumed from any application with internet access.  
      
     The namespace you created will then appear in the Management Portal
    and takes a moment to activate. Wait until the status is **Active**
    before moving on.

## Obtain the Default Management Credentials for the Namespace

In order to perform management operations, such as creating a queue, on
the new namespace, you need to obtain the management credentials for the
namespace.

1.  In the left navigation pane, click the **Service Bus** node, to
    display the list of available namespaces:   
    ![Available Namespaces screenshot][credentials-available-namespaces]
2.  Select the namespace you just created from the list shown:   
    ![Namespace List screenshot][credentials-namespace-list]
3.  The right-hand **Properties** pane will list the properties for the
    new namespace:   
    ![Properties Pane screenshot][credentials-properties-pane]
4.  The **Default Key** is hidden. Click the **View** button to display
    the security credentials:   
    ![Default Key screenshot][credentials-default-key]
5.  Make a note of the **Default Issuer** and the **Default Key** as you
    will use this information below to perform operations with the
    namespace. Specifically, the value for **Default Issuer** will be assigned to the *issuer* variable and the value for **Default Key** will be assigned to the *key* variable in the Java program, **Client.java**.


## Create a JSP worker Role

In this section, you will build the front end of your application. After that, you will add the code for submitting items to a Service Bus Queue.

#### Creating an Application Using the Windows Azure Plugin for Eclipse with Java

The following steps show you how to create and deploy a basic JSP application to Windows Azure using the Windows Azure Plugin for Eclipse with Java. 

The application will look similar to the following:

![][front-screenshot]

##### Prerequisites 

- A Java Developer Kit (JDK), v 1.6 or later.
 
- Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers, Helios or later. This can be downloaded from [http://www.eclipse.org/downloads](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads).
 
- A distribution of a Java-based web server or application server, such as Apache Tomcat, GlassFish, JBoss Application Server, or Jetty.
 
- A Windows Azure subscription, which can be acquired from [http://www.microsoft.com/windowsazure/offers/](http://www.microsoft.com/windowsazure/offers/)
 
- The Windows Azure Plugin for Eclipse with Java. For more information, see Installing the Windows Azure Plugin for Eclipse with Java.

##### To create a Windows Azure application using Java

- First, we’ll start off with creating a Java project. Start Eclipse. Within Eclipse, at the menu click **File**, click **New**, and then click **Dynamic Web Project**. (If you don’t see Dynamic Web Project listed as an available project after clicking **File**, **New**, then do the following: click **File**, click **New**, click **Project…**, expand **Web**, click **Dynamic Web Project**, and click **Next**.) For purposes of this tutorial, name the project **HelloWorld**. (Ensure you use this name, subsequent steps in this tutorial expect your WAR file to be named HelloWorld). Your screen should look similar to the following:

![Create Web Project][new-dynamic-web-project-dialog]

- Click **Finish**.

- Within Eclipse’s Project Explorer view, expand **HelloWorld**. Right-click WebContent, click **New**, and then click **JSP File**.

- In the **New JSP File** dialog, name the file **index.jsp**. Keep the parent folder as HelloWorld\WebContent, as shown in the following:

![Create JSP File][new-jsp-file]

- Click **Next**.

- In the **Select JSP Template** dialog, for purposes of this tutorial select **New JSP File (html)** and click **Finish**.

- Add the Windows Azure Service Runtime library to your build path. Within Eclipse’s Project Explorer, right-click the **HelloWorld** project and click **Properties**.

- In the left-hand pane of the **Properties** dialog, click **Java Build Path**.

- Click the **Libraries** tab, and then click **Add External JARs**.
 
- In the **JAR Selection** dialog, browse to the JAR that you installed locally for the Windows Azure Libraries for Java, click **Next**, and then click **Finish**.
 
- Repeat the **Add External JARs** process for any dependent JARs, as listed at Download the Windows Azure SDK for Java.
 
- Add the Windows Azure Libraries for Java JAR and any dependencies to the deployment assembly. In the left-hand pane of the **Properties** dialog, click **Deployment Assembly**, and then click **Add**.

- In the **New Assembly Directive** dialog, click **Java Build Path Entries** and then click **Next**.
 
- Select the JAR for the Windows Azure Libraries for Java, as well as any applicable dependencies, and then click **Finish**.
 
- Click **OK** to close the **Properties** dialog.
 
- Modify the code in index.jsp, to include an **import** statement for the Service Runtime library, and also add in  functionality that uses this library. The following shows an index.jsp file that includes the **import** statement, and includes calls into the Service Runtime library.

- The code uses Service Bus queues functionality to send messages to a queue. Management operations for Service Bus queues can be performed via the
**ServiceBusContract** class. A **ServiceBusContract** object is
constructed with an appropriate configuration that encapsulates the
token permissions to manage it, and the **ServiceBusContract** class is
the sole point of communication with Azure. The **ServiceBusService** class provides methods to create, enumerate,
and delete queues. The example below shows how a **ServiceBusService**
can be used to create a queue named "TestQueue" within a "HowToSample"
service namespace. To send a message to a Service Bus Queue, your application will obtain a
**ServiceBusContract** object. The below code demonstrates how to send a
message for the "TestQueue" queue we created above within our
"HowToSample" service namespace:


- Messages sent to (and received from ) Service Bus queues are instances
of the **BrokeredMessage** class. **BrokeredMessage** objects have a set
of standard methods (such as **getLabel**, **getTimeToLive**,
**setLabel**, and **setTimeToLive**), a dictionary that is used to hold
custom application specific properties, and a body of arbitrary
application data. An application can set the body of the message by
passing any serializable object into the constructor of the
**BrokeredMessage**, and the appropriate serializer will then be used to
serialize the object. Alternatively, a **java.IO.InputStream** can be
provided.





		// Include the following imports at the top of the page to use service bus APIs

			ServiceBusContract service = ServiceBusService.create(config);			
			QueueInfo queueInfo = new QueueInfo(queueName);
			
			try			
			{				
				CreateQueueResult result = service.createQueue(queueInfo);			
			} 			
			catch (ServiceException e) {				 
				System.err.print("ServiceException encountered: ");			
				System.err.println(e.getMessage());			
			}

			try			
			{				
				BrokeredMessage message = new BrokeredMessage("testOnlineOrder");			
				service.sendQueueMessage(queueName, message);			
			} 			
			catch (ServiceException e) {			
				System.err.print("ServiceException encountered: ");			
				System.err.println(e.getMessage());			
			}		
					  %>
					</body>
					</html>
	
- The page directive includes the import statement for the Service Runtime classes. Several other Service Runtime methods are used. 

##### To create a special Windows Azure project for deployment

- Now we’ll create a Windows Azure project. Within Eclipse, at the menu click **File**, click **New**, and then click **Windows Azure Project**. (If you don’t see **Windows Azure Project** listed as an available project after clicking **File**, **New**, then do the following: click **File**, click **New**, click **Project…**, expand **Windows Azure Project**, click **Windows Azure Project**, and click **Next**.) For purposes of this tutorial, name the project **MyAzureProject**. Modify the **Location:** value if needed. Make a note of the location, you’ll need it when you export your WAR file. Accept the default values for **WorkerRole1**. Your **New Windows Azure Project** dialog should look similar to the following:

![Create Azure Project][new-windows-azure-project]

- Click **Finish**.

- Create a WAR file of the Java project. Within Eclipse’s Project Explorer, right-click **HelloWorld**, click **Export**, and click **WAR file**. In the **Export** dialog, click the **Browse** button.

- In the **Save As** dialog, navigate to the following location (where <em>&lt;your_project_location&gt;</em> is the folder where you created your Windows Azure project):

*<your_project_location>\MyAzureProject\WorkerRole1\approot*

- Click **Save**. You’ll be prompted to overwrite the existing file, because a default **HelloWorld.war** file ships with the Windows Azure project. Click **Overwrite existing file**. Your **Export** dialog should appear as the following (other than the path used in the **Destination** field - use the path you specified earlier):

![Export WAR File][war-export]

- Click **Finish**.

- Within Eclipse’s Project Explorer, expand **MyAzureProject**, expand **WorkerRole1**, and expand **approot**. There, you’ll see your **HelloWorld.war** file that you exported in the previous step. (If you don’t see your WAR file, refresh your Eclipse view by clicking the **File** menu choice, then clicking **Refresh**). Your Project Explorer should look similar to the following:

![approot view][project-explorer-1]

- To confirm that the HelloWorld.war file is the one that you exported, right-click **HelloWorld.war** to bring up the **Properties** menu option, then view the date and time that the WAR file was created.

- Now we’ll copy over zips of your JDK and server. These zips will be copied to the **approot** folder.

- Create the zips if needed, and then use File Explorer to drag the zips to the **approot** folder in Eclipse’s Project Explorer. When prompted by the **File Operation** dialog, choose **Copy files**. After dragging the zips to the **approot** folder, your Project Explorer should look similar to the following (for purposes of this tutorial, an Apache zip was used, your web server may be different):

![approot view][project-explorer-2]

- Now we’ll customize the startup script used for your application server. Within Project Explorer, expand the **samples** folder under **MyAzureProject**.

- First we’ll copy the appropriate script contents into your clipboard buffer. Within the **samples** folder, you’ll see a set of files that provide specific startup commands for different types of web servers. Open the file that applies to your web server by double-clicking it. With the file opened in Eclipse, from Eclipse’s menu click **Edit**, then click **Select All**. Next, right-click the selected text and click **Copy**. 

- Now we’ll overwrite the **startup.cmd** contents with the content you just placed into the clipboard buffer. Within Project Explorer, right-click **startup.cmd** (which is in the **approot** folder), click **Open With**, then click **Text Editor**. After startup.cmd opens in Eclipse, from the menu click **Edit**, click **Select All**, click **Edit** from the menu again, and then click **Delete**. Then right-click inside the now-empty startup.cmd and click **Paste** to paste in the startup commands for your web server.

- If you are using a different server directory name than the value specified in the **SET SERVER_DIR_NAME=** statement, modify the value as needed. Additionally, there are comments in within the updated startup.cmd that provide additional guidance.

- Save startup.cmd.

- Build your project. Within Eclipse’s menu, click **Project**, then click **Build Project**. Ensure the build is successful before proceeding to the next section.

##### To deploy your application to the compute emulator

- In Eclipse’s Project Explorer, expand **MyAzureProject**, expand **emulatorTools**, and double-click **RunInEmulator.cmd**. This will launch your Java web application in the compute emulator. When you are prompted to allow this command to make changes to your computer; click **Yes**.

- Examine the output of the compute emulator UI to determine if there are any issues with your project. It may take several minutes for your deployment to be fully started within the compute emulator.

- Start your browser and use the URL http://localhost:8080/HelloWorld as the address (the HelloWorld portion of the URL is case-sensitive). You should see your HelloWorld application (the output of index.jsp), similar to the following

![][front-screenshot-localhost]

- When you are ready to stop your application from running in the compute emulator, within the **emulatorTools** node, double-click **ResetEmulator.cmd**. (Alternatively, the compute emulator UI has menu options for stopping and deleting an application).

##### To deploy your application to Windows Azure

- By default, a new Windows Azure project is configured to build a project to run in the compute emulator. To prepare it for deployment to the cloud, within Eclipse’s Project Explorer, right-click **MyAzureProject** and click **Properties**. In the left pane of the **Properties** dialog, click **Windows Azure**, and then select **Deployment to cloud** in the **Build for** list box. Your **Properties** dialog should look similar to the following:

![][project-properties]

- For purposes of this tutorial, we’ll turn off Remote Access for the Windows Azure project. In the left pane of the **Properties** dialog, expand **Windows Azure** and click **Remote Access**. In the **Remote Access** dialog, uncheck the **Enable all roles to accept Remote Desktop connections with these login credentials**. Click **OK** to close the Remote Access dialog.

- Build your project, through Eclipse’s menu options **Project**, **Build All**. Ensure the build is successful before proceeding to the next section.

- Within Eclipse’s Project Explorer, expand MyAzureProject, and then expand deploy. Within the deploy folder you should see three files, ServiceConfiguration.cscfg, WindowsAzurePackage.cspkg, and WindowsAzurePortal.url. You will need to upload the first two files to Windows Azure through the Windows Azure Management Portal, which we’ll do shortly. The third file, WindowsAzurePortal.url, is a shortcut to the Windows Azure Management Portal.

- Double-click WindowsAzurePortal.url, which will launch the Windows Azure Management Portal in your browser.

- Log in to the Windows Azure Management Portal. Within the Windows Azure Platform Management Portal, click **Hosted Services, Storage Accounts &amp; CDN**. Click **New Hosted Service**. Select a subscription that will be used for this service.
 
- Enter a name for your service. This name is used to distinguish your services within the Windows Azure Platform Management Portal for the specified subscription.
 
- Enter the URL for your service. The Windows Azure Platform Management Portal ensures that the URL is unique within the Windows Azure platform (not in use by anyone else’s service).
 
- Choose a region from the list of regions, for example, North Central US.
 
- Choose **Deploy to stage environment**. Ensure that **Start after successful deployment** is checked. Specify a name for the deployment. For **Package location**, click the corresponding **Browse Locally…** button, navigate to the folder where your WindowsAzurePackage.cspkg file is and select WindowsAzurePackage.cspkg.
 
- For **Configuration file**, click the corresponding **Browse Locally…** button, navigate to the folder where your ServiceConfiguration.cscfg is (*your_project_location\MyAzureProject\deploy\*), and select ServiceConfiguration.cscfg.
 
- Click **OK**. You will receive a warning after you click **OK** because there is only one instance of the worker role defined for your application. For purposes of this walk-through, override the warning by clicking **Yes**, but realize that you likely will want more than one instance of a worker role for a robust application.
 
- You can monitor the status of the deployment in the Windows Azure Platform Management Portal by navigating to the **Hosted Services** section. Because this was a deployment to a staging environment, the DNS will be of the form *http://guid.cloudapp.net*. You can see the DNS name if you click the deployment name in the Windows Azure Platform Management Portal (you may need to expand the Hosted Service node to see the deployment name); the DNS name is in the right hand pane of the portal. Once your deployment has a status of **Ready** (as indicated by the Windows Azure Platform Management Portal), you can enter the URL for your deployed application in your browser to see that your application is deployed to the cloud. The URL for an application deployed to the staging environment will be of the form *http://guid.cloudapp.net/*. For example, *http://72d5eb5875234b7ca8c7f74c80a2a1f1.cloudapp.net*. Remember to append **HelloWorld** (case-sensitive) to the end of the URL, so you’ll be using a URL similar to the following in your browser (use the GUID assigned to your URL instead of the GUID listed here): *http://72d5eb5875234b7ca8c7f74c80a2a1f1.cloudapp.net/HelloWorld*.
 
- Although this walk-through was for a deployment to the staging environment, a deployment to production follows the same steps, except you pick the production environment instead of staging. A deployment to production results in a DNS name based on the URL of your choice, instead of a GUID as used for staging. If this is your first exposure to the Windows Azure Platform Management Portal, take some time to familiarize yourself with its functionality. For example, similar to the way you deployed your service, the portal provides functionality for stopping, starting, deleting, or upgrading a deployment.

- At this point you have deployed your Windows Azure application to the cloud. However, before proceeding, realize that a deployed application, even if it is not running, will continue to accrue billable time for your subscription. Therefore, it is extremely important that you delete unwanted deployments from your Windows Azure subscription. To delete the deployment, use the Hosted Services section of the Windows Azure Platform Management Portal: Navigate to your deployment, select it, and then click the **Delete** icon. This will stop, and then delete, the deployment. If you only want to stop the deployment and not delete it, click the **Stop** icon instead of the **Delete** icon (but as mentioned above, if you do not delete the deployment, billable charges will continue to accrue for your deployment even if it is stopped).


#### Create the Back-end VM Role

You will now create the back-end VM role that will process the submissions from the front-end JSP worker role you've just created.

##### How to run a task in Java on a virtual machine

With Windows Azure, you can use a virtual machine to handle compute-intensive tasks; for example, a virtual machine could handle tasks and deliver results to client machines or mobile applications. You will learn how to create a virtual machine that runs a Java application.

This tutorial assumes you know how to create Java console applications, import libraries to your Java application, and generate a Java archive (JAR). No knowledge of Windows Azure is assumed. 

You will learn:

- How to create a virtual machine.
- How to remotely log in to your virtual machine.
- How to install a JRE or JDK on your virtual machine.
- How to create a service bus namespace.
- How to create a Java application
- How to run the Java application

##### To create a virtual machine

1. Log in to the [Windows Azure Preview Management Portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com).
2. Click **New**.
3. Click **Virtual machine**.
4. Click **Quick create**.
5. In the **Create a virtual machine** screen, enter a value for **DNS name**.
6. From the **Image** dropdown list, select an image, such as **Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1**.
7. Enter a password in the **New password** field, and re-enter it in the **Confirm** field. Remember this password, you will use it when you remotely log in to the virtual machine.
8. From the **Location** drop down list, select the data center location for your virtual machine; for example, **West US**.
9. Click **Create virtual machine**. Your virtual machine will be created. You can monitor the status in the **Virtual machines** section of the management portal.

##### To remotely log in to your virtual machine

1. Log on to the [Preview Management Portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com).
2. Click **Virtual machines**.
3. Click the name of the virtual machine that you want to log in to.
4. Click **Connect**.
5. Respond to the prompts as needed to connect to the virtual machine. When prompted for the password, use the password that you provided when you created the virtual machine.

##### To install a JRE or JDK on your virtual machine

To run Java applications on your virtual machine, you need to install install a Java Runtime Environment (JRE). For purposes of this tutorial, we'll install a Java Developer Kit (JDK) to your virtual machine and use the JDK's JRE. You could however install a JRE only if you choose to do so. 

For purposes of this tutorial, a JDK will be installed from Oracle's site.

1. Log on to your virtual machine.
2. Within your browser, open [http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html).
3. Click the **Download** button for the JDK that you want to download. For purposes of this tutorial, the **Download** button for the Java SE 6 Update 32 JDK was used.
4. Accept the license agreement.
5. Click the download executable for **Windows x64 (64-bit)**.
6. Follow the prompts and respond as needed to install the JDK to your virtual machine. 

Note that the Service Bus functionality requires the GTE CyberTrust Global Root certificate to be installed as part of your JRE's **cacerts** store. This certificate is automatically included in the JRE used by this tutorial. If you do not have this certificate in your JRE **cacerts** store, it can be installed by copying the certificate contents from <https://secure.omniroot.com/cacert/ct_root.der>, saving the contents to a **.cer** file, and adding it to the **cacerts** store via **keytool**. 

##### How to create a middle-tier Java application

1. On your development machine, create a Java console application using the following Java program. For purposes of this tutorial, we'll use **Client.java** as the Java file name. As above, modify the **your\_service\_bus\_namespace**, **your\_service\_bus\_owner**, and **your\_service\_bus\_key** placeholders to use your service bus **namespace**, **Default Issuer** and **Default Key** values, respectively.service bus **Namespace**,  **Default Issuer** and **Default Key** values, respectively.

            }
        
        }
  

2. Export the application to a runnable Java archive (JAR), and package the required libraries into the generated JAR. For purposes of this tutorial, we'll use **Client.jar** as the generated JAR name.


##### How to run the application
1. Log on to your machine where you will run the client application. This does not need to be the same machine running the **Client** application, although it can be.
2. Create a folder where you will run your application. For example, **c:\Client**.
3. Copy **Client.jar** to **c:\Client**,
4. Create a file named **c:\Client\output.txt**
5. Ensure the JRE's bin folder is in the PATH environment variable.
6. At a command prompt, change directories to c:\TSP.
7. Run the following command:

        java -jar Client.jar

The client will run until it sees a queue message of "Complete". 

To delete the queue, run 

        java -jar Client.jar deletequeue
