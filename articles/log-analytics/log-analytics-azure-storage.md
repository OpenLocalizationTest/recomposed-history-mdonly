# Collect data from Azure Diagnostics Using Log Analytics

Azure resources can use Azure diagnostics to write logs and metrics to an Azure storage account. Log Analytics can consume this data and make it easier to monitor your Azure resources.

>[AZURE.NOTE] For monitoring Azure virtual machines (both Linux and Windows) we recommend installing the Microsoft Monitoring Agent VM extension. This will provide you with deeper insights on your virtual machines than if you use the diagnostics written to storage.

Depending on the resource, Azure diagnostics will write to either Azure table storage or Azure blob storage. 

## Supported Azure Resources

Log Analytics can read the Azure diagnostics output for the following resources:

| Resource Type | Logs (Diagnostic Categories) | Log Analytics Solution |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Automation <br> Microsoft.Automation/AutomationAccounts | JobLogs <br> JobStreams          | AzureAutomation | 
| Key Vault <br> Microsoft.KeyVault/Vaults               | AuditEvent                       | KeyVault        |
| Application Gateway <br> Microsoft.Network/ApplicationGateways   | ApplicationGatewayAccessLog <br> ApplicationGatewayPerformanceLog | AzureNetworking |
| Network Security Group <br> Microsoft.Network/NetworkSecurityGroups | NetworkSecurityGroupEvent <br> NetworkSecurityGroupRuleCounter | AzureNetworking |
| Service Fabric                          | ETWEvent <br> Operational Event <br> ReliableActor Event <br> Reliable Service Event| ServiceFabric |
| Virtual Machines | Event <br> IIS Log | *none* |
| Web Roles <br> Worker Roles | Event <br> IIS Log | *none* |




## Collect data using Azure diagnostics

OMS can analyze data written to Azure storage by Azure diagnostics. There are 2 main steps to perform:

- Configure the collection of diagnostic data to Azure storage
- Configure OMS to analyze data in the storage account

The topics below describe how to enable collection of diagnostics data to Azure storage and then how to configure OMS to analyze the data in Azure storage.

Azure Diagnostics is an Azure extension that enables you to collect diagnostic data from a worker role, web role, or virtual machine running in Azure. The data is stored in an Azure storage account and can then be used by OMS.

>[AZURE.NOTE] If you have a paid subscription, you'll be charged normal data rates for storage and transactions when you send diagnostics to a storage account and for when OMS reads the data from your storage account.

Azure Diagnostics can collect the following types of telemetry:

Data Source|Description
 ---|---
IIS Logs|Information about IIS web sites.
Azure Diagnostic infrastructure logs|Information about Diagnostics itself.
IIS Failed Request logs |Information about failed requests to an IIS site or application.
Windows Event logs|Information sent to the Windows event logging system.
Performance counters|Operating System and custom performance counters.
Crash dumps|Information about the state of the process in the event of an application crash.
Custom error logs|Logs created by your application or service.
NET EventSource|Events generated by your code using the .NET [EventSource class](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.diagnostics.tracing.eventsource%28v=vs.110%29.aspx)
Manifest based ETW|ETW events generated by any process
Syslog|Events sent to the Syslog or Rsyslog daemons


Currently, OMS is able to analyze:

- IIS logs from Web roles and virtual machines
- Windows Event logs and ETW logs from Web roles, Worker roles and Azure virtual machines running a Windows operating system
- Syslog from Azure virtual machines running a Linux operating system
- Diagnostics written to blob storage in json format for Network Security Group, Application Gateway, and KeyVault resources

The logs must be in the following locations:

- WADWindowsEventLogsTable (Table Storage) – Contains information from Windows Event logs.
- WADETWEventTable (Table Storage) – Contains information from Windows ETW logs.
- WADServiceFabricSystemEventTable, WADServiceFabricReliableActorEventTable, WADServiceFabricReliableServiceEventTable (Table Storage) - Contains information on Service Fabric Operational, Actor and Service events.
- wad-iis-logfiles (Blob Storage) – Contains information about IIS logs.
- LinuxsyslogVer2v0 (Table Storage) – Contains Linux syslog events.

    >[AZURE.NOTE] IIS logs from Azure Websites are not currently supported.

For virtual machines, you also have the option of installing the [Microsoft Monitoring Agent](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=517269) into your virtual machine to enable additional insights. In addition to being able to analyze IIS logs and Event Logs you will also allow be able to perform additional analysis including configuration change tracking, SQL assessment and update assessment.

## Enable Azure diagnostics in a Web role for IIS log and event collection

Refer to [How To Enable Diagnostics in a Cloud Service](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn482131.aspx). You’ll use the basic information from there and customize the steps here for use with OMS.

With Azure diagnostics enabled:

- IIS logs are stored by default, with log data transferred at the scheduledTransferPeriod transfer interval.

- Windows Event Logs are not transferred by default.

### To enable diagnostics

To enable Windows Event Logs, or to change the scheduledTransferPeriod, configure Azure Diagnostics using the XML configuration file (diagnostics.wadcfg), as shown in [Step 2: Add the diagnostics.wadcfg file to your Visual Studio solution](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn482131.aspx#BKMK_step2) and [Step 3: Configure diagnostics for your application](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn482131.aspx#BKMK_step3) in the How To Enable Diagnostics in a Cloud Service topic. The following example configuration file collects IIS Logs and all Events from the Application and System logs:

```
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
    <DiagnosticMonitorConfiguration xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/ServiceHosting/2010/10/DiagnosticsConfiguration"
          configurationChangePollInterval="PT1M"
          overallQuotaInMB="4096">

      <Directories bufferQuotaInMB="0"
         scheduledTransferPeriod="PT10M">  
        <!-- IISLogs are only relevant to Web roles -->
        <IISLogs container="wad-iis" directoryQuotaInMB="0" />
      </Directories>

      <WindowsEventLog bufferQuotaInMB="0"
         scheduledTransferLogLevelFilter="Verbose"
         scheduledTransferPeriod="PT10M">
        <DataSource name="Application!*" />
        <DataSource name="System!*" />
      </WindowsEventLog>

    </DiagnosticMonitorConfiguration>
```

In [Step 4: Configure storage of your diagnostics data](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn482131.aspx#BKMK_step4) of the How To Enable Diagnostics in a Cloud Service topic, ensure that your ConfigurationSettings specifies a storage account, as in the following example:

```
    <ConfigurationSettings>
       <Setting name="Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Plugins.Diagnostics.ConnectionString" value="DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=<AccountName>;AccountKey=<AccountKey>"/>
    </ConfigurationSettings>
```

The **AccountName** and **AccountKey** values are found in the Microsoft Azure Management Portal in the storage account dashboard, under Manage Access Keys. The protocol for the connection string must be **https**.

Once the updated diagnostic configuration is applied to your cloud service and it is writing diagnostics to Azure Storage, then you are ready to configure OMS.

## Enable Azure diagnostics in a virtual machine for event log and IIS log collection

Use the following procedure to enable Azure diagnostics in a virtual machine for Event Log and IIS log collection using the Microsoft Azure management portal.

### To enable Azure diagnostics in a virtual machine with the Azure management portal

1. Install the VM Agent when you create a virtual machine. If the virtual machine already exists, verify that the VM Agent is already installed.
	- If you use the default Azure management portal to create the virtual machine, perform a **Custom Create** and select **Install the VM Agent**.
	- If you use the new Azure management portal to create a virtual machine, select **Optional Configuration**, then **Diagnostics** and set **Status** to **On**.

	Upon completion, the VM will automatically have the Azure Diagnostics extension installed and running which will be responsible for collecting your diagnostics data.

2. Enable monitoring and configure event logging on an existing VM. You can enable diagnostics at the VM level. To enable diagnostics and then configure event logging, perform the following steps:
	1. Select the VM.
	2. Click **Monitoring**.
	3. Click **Diagnostics**.
	4. Set the **Status** to **ON**.
	5. Select each diagnostics metric that you want to use. OMS can analyze Windows event system logs, Windows event application logs and IIS logs.
	7. Click **OK**.

Using Azure PowerShell you can more precisely specify the events that are written to Azure Storage. Refer to the Azure Diagnostics 1.2 Configuration Schema for a sample configuration file and detailed documentation on its schema. Ensure that you install and configure Azure PowerShell version 0.8.7 or later from [How to install and configure Azure PowerShell](../powershell-install-configure.md). If you have a version of Microsoft Azure Diagnostics installed that is earlier than version 1.2 you cannot use the new portal to enable or configure diagnostics.

You can enable and update the Agent using the following PowerShell script. You can also use this script with custom logging configuration. You will need to modify the script to set the storage account, service name and virtual machine name.

### To enable diagnostics in a virtual machine with Azure PowerShell

Review the following script sample, copy it, modify it as needed, save the sample as a PowerShell script file, and then run the script.


	#Connect to Azure
	Add-AzureAccount

	# settings to change:
	$wad_storage_account_name = "myStorageAccount"
	$service_name = "myService"
	$vm_name = "myVM"

	#Construct Azure Diagnostics public config and convert to config format

	# Collect just system error events:
	$wad_xml_config = "<WadCfg><DiagnosticMonitorConfiguration><WindowsEventLog scheduledTransferPeriod=""PT1M""><DataSource name=""System!* "" /></WindowsEventLog></DiagnosticMonitorConfiguration></WadCfg>"

	$wad_b64_config = [System.Convert]::ToBase64String([System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes($wad_xml_config))
	$wad_public_config = [string]::Format("{{""xmlCfg"":""{0}""}}",$wad_b64_config)

	#Construct Azure diagnostics private config

	$wad_storage_account_key = (Get-AzureStorageKey $wad_storage_account_name).Primary
	$wad_private_config = [string]::Format("{{""storageAccountName"":""{0}"",""storageAccountKey"":""{1}""}}",$wad_storage_account_name,$wad_storage_account_key)

	#Enable Diagnostics Extension for Virtual Machine

	$wad_extension_name = "IaaSDiagnostics"
	$wad_publisher = "Microsoft.Azure.Diagnostics"
	$wad_version = (Get-AzureVMAvailableExtension -Publisher $wad_publisher -ExtensionName $wad_extension_name).Version # Gets latest version of the extension

	(Get-AzureVM -ServiceName $service_name -Name $vm_name) | Set-AzureVMExtension -ExtensionName $wad_extension_name -Publisher $wad_publisher -PublicConfiguration $wad_public_config -PrivateConfiguration $wad_private_config -Version $wad_version | Update-AzureVM


## Enable Azure Storage analysis by OMS

You can enable storage analysis and configure OMS to read from the Azure Storage account with Azure Diagnostics by using the information at [Data sources in Log Analytics](log-analytics-data-sources.md#collect-data-from-azure-diagnostics).

In approximately 1 hour you will begin to see data from the storage account available for analysis within OMS.


## Next steps

- [Configure proxy and firewall settings in Log Analytics](log-analytics-proxy-firewall.md) if your organization uses a proxy server or firewall so that agents can communicate with the Log Analytics service.
