# Windows event log in Log Analytics

Windows Event logs are one of the most common data sources used for Windows agents since this is the method used by many applications to log information and errors.  You can collect events from standard logs such as System and Application in addition to specifying any custom logs created by applications you need to monitor.

# Configuring Windows Event logs

Events will only be collected from the Windows event logs that are specified.  You can add a new log by typing in the name of the log and clicking **+**.  For each log, only events with the selected severities will be collected.  Check the severities for the particular log that you want to collect.

# Data collection

Log Analytics will collect each event that matches a selected severity from a monitored event log as the event is created.  The agent will record its place in each event log that it collects from.  If the agent goes offline for a period of time, then Log Analytics will collect events from where it last left off, even if those events were created while the agent was offline.
