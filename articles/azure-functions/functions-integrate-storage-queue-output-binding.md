# Add messages to an Azure Storage queue using Functions

Learn how to update an existing function by adding an output binding that sends messages to Azure Queue storage. 

![View message in the logs.](./media/functions-integrate-storage-queue-output-binding/functions-integrate-storage-binding-in-portal.png)

[!INCLUDE [Next steps note](../../includes/functions-quickstart-previous-topics.md)]

You also need to download and install the [Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer](http://storageexplorer.com/). 

It should take you less than five minutes to complete all the steps in this topic.

## Find your function    

1. Log in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/). 

2. In the search bar at the top of the portal, type the name of your function app, select it from the list. Under the function app, select and expand the HTTP triggered function you created in the previous topic. 

## <a name="add-binding"></a>Add a Queue storage output binding
 
1. In your function, click **Integrate** and **+ New output**, then click **Azure Queue storage** and click **Select**.
    
    ![Add a Queue storage output binding to a function in the Azure portal.](./media/functions-integrate-storage-queue-output-binding/function-add-queue-storage-output-binding.png)

2. Choose a **Storage account connection** or click **New** to create a new one. Type `outqueue` for **Queue name** and `outQueueItem` for **Message parameter name**, then click **Save**.

    ![Add a Queue storage output binding to a function in the Azure portal.](./media/functions-integrate-storage-queue-output-binding/function-add-queue-storage-output-binding-2.png) 

Now that you have an output binding defined, you need to update the code to use the binding to add messages to a queue.  

## Update the function code

1. Click your function to display the function code in the editor. 

2. For a C# function, update your function definition as follows to add the **outQueueItem** storage binding parameter:

    ```cs   
    public static async Task<HttpResponseMessage> Run(HttpRequestMessage req, 
        ICollector<string> outQueueItem, TraceWriter log)
    {
        ....
    }
    ```

3. Add the following code for your chosen language to the function just before the method returns: 

    ```javascript
        context.bindings.outQueueItem = "Name passed to the function: " + 
                (req.query.name || req.body.name);
    ```

    ```cs
    outQueueItem.Add("Name passed to the function: " + name);     
    ```

The value passed to the HTTP trigger is included in the message added to the queue.
 
## Test the function 

1. After the code changes are saved, click **Run**. 

    ![Add a Queue storage output binding to a function in the Azure portal.](./media/functions-integrate-storage-queue-output-binding/functions-test-run-function.png)

2. Check the logs to make sure that the function succeeded. A new queue named **outqueue** is created in your Storage account by the Functions runtime when the output binding is first used.

Next, you can connect to your storage account to verify the new queue and the message you added to it.

## Connect to the queue

1. In your function, click **Integrate** and the new **Azure Queue storage** output binding, then expand **Documentation**. Copy both **Account name** and **Account key**. You use these credentials to connect to the storage account.
 
    ![Get the Storage account connection credentials.](./media/functions-integrate-storage-queue-output-binding/function-get-storage-account-credentials.png)

2. Run the [Microsoft Azure Storage Explorer](http://storageexplorer.com/) tool, click the connect icon on the left, choose **Use a storage account name and key**, and click **Next**.

    ![Run the Storage Account Explorer tool.](./media/functions-integrate-storage-queue-output-binding/functions-storage-manager-connect-1.png)
    
3. Enter the **Account name** and **Account key** from step 1, click **Next** and then **Connect**. 
  
    ![Enter the storage credentials and connect.](./media/functions-integrate-storage-queue-output-binding/functions-storage-manager-connect-2.png)

4. Expand the attached storage account, right-click **Queues** and verify that a queue named **outqueue** exists. You should also see a message already in the queue.
