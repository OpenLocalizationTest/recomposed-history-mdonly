# Azure Functions Overview

Azure functions is a solution for easily running small pieces of code, or "functions," in the cloud. You can write just the code you need for the problem at hand, without worrying about a whole application or the infrastructure to run it. This can make development even more productive, and you can [get started with your first function](functions-create-first-azure-function.md) in just minutes.

Write any function under a minute - either when you need a simple job to clean a database or to build functionality that processes millions of messages from connected devices. Use your development language of choice (C#, Node.JS, Python and more). Pay only for the time your code runs and trust Azure to scale as needed.

This topic provides a high-level overview of Azure Functions. If you want to jump right in and get started with Azure Functions, start with [Create your first Azure Function](functions-create-first-azure-function.md). If you are looking for more technical information about Functions, see the [developer reference](functions-reference.md).

## What can I do with Functions?

Azure Functions is a great solution for processing data, and integrating systems, working with the internet-of-things (IoT), and building simple APIs and microservices.

Functions includes a gallery of templates for common scenarios, such as:

* Responding to a GitHub webhook request.
* Resizing an image that was uploaded to Azure Storage.
* Working with order processing queues.


## Features

Here are some key features of Azure Functions:
    
* **Choice of language** - Write functions using C#, Node.js, Python, F#, PHP, batch, bash, Java, or any executable.  
* **Pay-per-use pricing model** - Pay only for the time spent running your code. See the Dynamic App Service Plan option in the [pricing section](#pricing) below.  
* **Bring your own dependencies** - Functions supports NuGet and NPM, so you can use your favorite libraries.  
* **Integrated security** - Protect HTTP-triggered functions with OAuth providers such as Azure Active Directory, Facebook, Google, Twitter, and Microsoft Account.  
* **Simplified integration** - Easily leverage Azure services and software-as-a-service (SaaS) offerings. See the [integrations section](#integrations) below for some examples.  
* **Flexible development** - Modify your functions with an in-portal editor, or set up continuous integration and deploy your code through GitHub, Visual Studio Team Services, and other <<<fix this>>>  
* **Open-source** - The Functions runtime is open-source and [available on GitHub](https://github.com/azure/azure-webjobs-sdk-script).  

### <a name="integrations"></a>Integrations

Azure Functions supports a variety of integrations with Azure and 3rd-party services. You can use these to trigger your function and start execution or to serve as input and output for your code. The table below shows some example integrations supported by Azure Functions. <<List services here>>

## <a name="pricing"></a>How much does Functions cost?

There are two pricing plans that you can choose for your Azure Functions: 

**Dynamic App Service Plan** - you don't have to worry about resource management. Whenever your function is run, Azure will provide all of the necessary computational resources. You only pay for the time that your code spends running. Full pricing details are available on the [Functions Pricing page](/pricing/details/functions). 

**Classic App Service Plan** allows you to run functions just like your web, mobile, and API apps. This is a great solution if you are already using App Service for other applications - your functions can run on the same plan for no additional cost. Full details can be found on the [App Service Pricing page](/pricing/details/app-service/).
