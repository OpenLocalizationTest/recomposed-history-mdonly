# Create a Function App in an App Service plan

This sample script creates an Azure Function App, which is a container for your functions. The Function App will be created using a dedicated App Service plan, which means your server resources are always on.

[!INCLUDE [sample-cli-install](../../../includes/sample-cli-install.md)]

## Sample script

Create app sample

[!code-azurecli[main](../../../cli_scripts/azure-functions/create-function-app-app-service-plan/create-function-app-app-service-plan.sh "Create an Azure Function on an App Service plan")]

## Clean up deployment

After the script sample has been run, the follow command can be used to remove the resource group, App Service app, and all related resources.

[!INCLUDE [cli-script-clean-up](../../../includes/cli-script-clean-up.md)]
