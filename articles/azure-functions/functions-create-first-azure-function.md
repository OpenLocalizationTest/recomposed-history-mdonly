# Create your first function in the Azure portal

This topic shows you how to use Azure Functions to create a "hello world" function that is invoked by an HTTP request. Before you can create a function in the Azure portal, you must create a function app to host the serverless execution of your function.

To complete this quickstart, you must have an Azure account. [Free accounts](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) are available. You can also [try Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/app-service/functions/) without having to register with Azure.

## Log in to Azure

Log in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
## Create a function from the portal quickstart

1. Go to the [Azure Functions portal](https://functions.azure.com/signin) and sign in with your Azure account. 
 
2. Type a unique **Name** for your new function app or accept the autogenerated one, select your preferred **Region**, then click **Create + get started**. A valid name can contain only letters, numbers, and hyphens. Underscore (**_**) is not an allowed character.

3. In the **Quickstart** tab, click **WebHook + API** and choose a language for your function, then click **Create this function**. A new predefined function is created in your chosen language.

4. (Optional) At this point in the quickstart, you can choose to take a quick tour of Azure Functions features in the portal. After you have completed or skipped the tour, you can test your new function by sending an HTTP request.

## Test the function
