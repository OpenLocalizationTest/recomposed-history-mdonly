# Create a function app in the Azure portal

This topic shows you how to create a simple "hello world" Azure Function that is invoked by an HTTP request. Before you can create a function in the Azure portal, you must create a function app in Azure App Service to host the execution of your function.

To complete this quickstart, you must have an Azure account. [Free accounts](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) are available. You can also [try Azure Functions](https://azure.microsoft.com/try/app-service/functions/) without having to register with Azure.

## Create a function app

[!INCLUDE [functions-create-function-app-portal](../../includes/functions-create-function-app-portal.md)]

## Create a function
These steps create a function in the new function app by using the Azure Functions quickstart.

1. In the **Quickstart** tab, click **WebHook + API** and choose a language for your function, then click **Create a function**. A new predefined function is created in your chosen language.

4. (Optional) At this point in the quickstart, you can choose to take a quick tour of Azure Functions features in the portal. After you have completed or skipped the tour, you can test your new function by sending an the HTTP request.


## Test the function
