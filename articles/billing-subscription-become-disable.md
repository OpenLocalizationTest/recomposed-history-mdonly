# Reactivate disabled Azure subscription

You might have your Azure subscription disabled because you reached your spending limits, have an overdue bill, hit your credit card limit, or because the subscription was cancelled by the administator of your subscription. See what issue applies to you and follow the steps in this article to get your subscription reactivated. 

## You reached your spending limit

When your usage exhausts the monthly amounts included with your subscription, we disable your service for the remainder of that billing month. This is to protect you from accidentally incurring charges for usage beyond the amount included with your subscription. You can remove the spending limit and [set up billing alerts for your Microsoft Azure subscriptions](billing-set-up-alerts.md) to help you monitor and manage billing activity for your Azure accounts.

To remove your spending limit,

1. Log in to the [Azure Account Center](https://account.windowsazure.com/Home/Index).

2. Click on **Subscriptions**.

3. Select a subscription.

4. Click **Subscription reached the Spending Limit and has been disabled to prevent charges**.

	If you don't see that option, click **Remove spending limit** in the subscription **Status** area.

5. Select one of the following options.

|Option|Effect|
|------|------|
|Remove spending limit indefinitely|Removes the spending limit until you turn it back on.|
|Remove spending limit for the current billing period|Removes the spending limit but the spending limit restarts for the next billing period.|

If you have a Free Trial subscription and you remove the spending limits, your subscription converts to Pay-As-You-Go at the end of the free trial.

## Your bill is past due

Pay your outstanding balance in full. To do this, see the article [Why have you received a notification that your Azure subscription has a past due balance?](billing-azure-subscription-past-due-balance.md#what-can-you-do-to-resolve-the-issue)

## The bill exceeds your credit card limit

To resolve this, [switch to a different credit card](billing-how-to-change-credit-card.md). Or if you're representing a business, you can [switch to pay by invoice](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/invoicing/).

## The subscription was cancelled by the Account Administrator

If you're the account administrator, reactivate your Pay As You Go subscription by using the following steps. 

1. Log in to the [Azure Account Center](https://account.windowsazure.com/Home/Index).
2. Select the cancelled subscription.
3. Click **Reactivate**.

For other subscription types, create a support ticket to have your subscription reactivated.

1. Sign into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/). 
2. Select **Help + support** > **New support request**.
