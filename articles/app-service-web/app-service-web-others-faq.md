## Why is Autoscale not working as expected

If you have noticed that Autoscale has not scaled-in or scaled-out the web app instances as you expected, you may be running into a scenario where we intentionally choose not to scale to avoid an infinite loop due to flapping. This usually happens when there isn't adequate margin between the scale-out and scale-in thresholds. How to avoid flapping and other Autoscale best practices are explained in good detail at this [link](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/insights-autoscale-best-practices/#autoscale-best-practices).

## Functions Preview Versions Deprecation

As discussed at https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/appserviceteam/2017/01/03/azure-functions-preview-versioning-update/ we recommend that you upgrade your Functions version to ~1 in the App Settings. The ~1 syntax means that you will use the latest version of the host with a major version of 1.
