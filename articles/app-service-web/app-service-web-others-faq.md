## Functions Preview Versions Deprecation

As discussed at https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/appserviceteam/2017/01/03/azure-functions-preview-versioning-update/ we recommend that you upgrade your Functions version to ~1 in the App Settings. The ~1 syntax means that you will use the latest version of the host with a major version of 1.
