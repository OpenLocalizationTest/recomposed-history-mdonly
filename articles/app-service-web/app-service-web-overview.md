# Web Apps overview

*App Service Web Apps* is a fully managed compute platform that is optimized for hosting websites and web applications. This [platform-as-a-service](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Platform_as_a_service) (PaaS) offering of Microsoft Azure lets you focus on your business logic while Azure takes care of the infrastructure to run and scale your apps.

For a 5-minute video overview, see [Azure App Service Web Apps with Yochay Kiriaty](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/videos/azure-app-service-web-apps-with-yochay-kiriaty/).

## What is a web app in App Service?

In App Service, a *web app* is the compute resources that Azure provides for hosting a website or web application.  

The compute resources may be on shared or dedicated virtual machines (VMs), depending on the pricing tier that you choose. Your application code runs in a managed VM that is isolated from other customers.

Your code can be in any language or framework that is supported by [Azure App Service](../app-service/app-service-value-prop-what-is.md), such as ASP.NET, Node.js, Java, PHP, or Python. You can also run scripts that use [PowerShell and other scripting languages](web-sites-create-web-jobs.md#acceptablefiles) in a web app.

Typical application scenarios that you can use Web Apps for include [global web presence sites](web-sites-global-web-presence-solution-overview.md), [digital marketing campaigns](web-sites-digital-marketing-application-solution-overview.md), and [business applications](web-sites-business-application-solution-overview.md).

## Why use Web Apps?

Here are some key features of App Service that apply to Web Apps:

- **Fully managed platform** - Automatic OS and framework patching, built-in support for backup and disaster recovery. 

- **Use your existing skills** - Code in your favorite language, framework, and development environment. App Service supports .NET, Node.js, Java, PHP, and Python. 

- **Fast deployment** - Provision new apps and deploy code to them in seconds.

- **Continuous Integration** - Set up [continuous integration and deployment](../app-service-web/app-service-continous-deployment.md) with Visual Studio Team Services, GitHub, or BitBucket.

- **Staging and test environments** - Implement [staged deployment](../app-service-web/web-sites-staged-publishing.md) to verify your code in a preproduction environment that is identical to your production environment. When you're ready, release a new version of your app with zero downtime by performing a swap operation. 

- **Testing in Production** - Take staged deployments to the next level and [perform A/B testing](../app-service-web/app-service-web-test-in-production-get-start.md) to verify your new code with a configurable fraction of your live traffic. 

- **Authentication and authorization** - Protect an app from unauthenticated access with no changes to your code. Built-in authentication services secure your apps for access by users, by clients representing users, or by services. Supported identity providers include Azure Active Directory, Facebook, Twitter, Google, and Microsoft Account. For more information, see [Authentication and authorization in Azure App Service](../app-service/app-service-authentication-overview.md).

- **Connect to any service** - Connect your app to enterprise systems or software-as-a-service (SaaS) platforms in minutes with built-in [connectors](../connectors/apis-list.md). Choose from more than 50 connectors for enterprise systems such as SAP, Siebel, and Oracle, popular enterprise SaaS services like Salesforce and Office 365, and popular internet services such as Facebook, Twitter, and Dropbox.

- **Global scale** - Scale [up](../app-service/app-service-scale.md) or [out](../azure-portal/insights-how-to-scale.md) to handle any incoming customer load. Manually select the number and size of VMs or set up auto-scaling based on load or schedule. Microsoft's global datacenter infrastructure hosts your apps and makes it easy to replicate data and hosting services in multiple locations. 

- **Enterprise-grade** - App Service is designed for building and hosting secure mission-critical applications. Build Active Directory integrated business apps that connect securely to on-premises resources, then host them on a secure cloud platform that is [ISO, SOC, and PCI compliant](https://www.microsoft.com/TrustCenter/). All with an enterprise-level [SLA](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/app-service/).

- **Azure Marketplace** - Select from an ever-growing [list of application templates](https://azure.microsoft.com/marketplace/). Leverage the best of the OSS app community with one-click installation of packages such as WordPress, Joomla and Drupal.

- **WebJobs** - [Run any program or script](../app-service-web/web-sites-create-web-jobs.md) on App Service VMs. Run jobs continuously, on a schedule, or triggered by events. The Azure [WebJobs SDK](../app-service-web/websites-dotnet-webjobs-sdk.md) simplifies the code you write to integrate with other Azure and third-party services.

- **Hybrid connections** - Access on-premises data using [Hybrid Connections](../biztalk-services/integration-hybrid-connection-overview.md) and [Azure Virtual Networks](../app-service-web/web-sites-integrate-with-vnet.md).

- **Visual Studio integration** - Dedicated tools in Visual Studio streamline the work of creating, deploying, consuming, debugging, and managing web apps, mobile apps, and API apps.

In addition, a web app can take advantage of features offered by [API Apps](../app-service-api/app-service-api-apps-why-best-platform.md) (such as CORS support) and [Mobile Apps](../app-service-mobile/app-service-mobile-value-prop.md) (such as push notifications). The only difference between these three app types (API, web, mobile) is the name and icon used for them in the Azure portal. For more information about app types in App Service, see [Azure App Service overview](../app-service/app-service-value-prop-what-is.md).

Besides Web Apps in App Service, Azure offers other services that can be used for hosting websites and web applications. For most scenarios Web Apps is the best choice.  For microservice architecture consider [Service Fabric](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/services/service-fabric), and if you need more control over the VMs that your code runs on, consider [Azure Virtual Machines](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/services/virtual-machines/).  For more information about how to choose between these Azure services, see [Azure App Service, Virtual Machines, Service Fabric, and Cloud Services](choose-web-site-cloud-service-vm.md).

## Getting started

To get started by deploying sample code to a new web app in App Service, follow the [Deploy your first web app to Azure in 5 minutes](app-service-web-get-started.md) tutorial. You'll need a free Azure account.

If you want to get started with Azure App Service before signing up for an Azure account, go to [Try App Service](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=523751), where you can immediately create a short-lived starter web app in App Service. No credit cards required; no commitments.
