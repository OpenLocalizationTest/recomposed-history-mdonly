# Create a Ruby App with Azure App Service on Linux - Preview

Azure App Service on Linux is currently in public preview and supports running web apps natively on Linux.

## Overview

This tutorial will show you how to create a basic ruby on rails application locally and prepare/deploy it to Azure App Service on Linux.

## Prerequisites

* [Ruby 2.3.3 or higher](https://www.ruby-lang.org/documentation/installation/#rubyinstaller)  installed on your development machine.
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) is installed on your development machine
* An [active Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/)
* This tutorial is written in the context of an Ubuntu environment. All system commands are bash specific.


## Create a new local rails application

1. Create a directory for the new app and change to that directory.

2. Initialize Ruby and check the version using the `ruby -v` command.

    ![Ruby init](./media/app-service-linux-ruby-get-started/ruby-version.png)

3. Install rails using the `gem install rails` command.

## SSH support with custom Docker images

In order for a custom Docker image to support SSH communication between the container and the client in the Azure portal, perform the following steps for your Docker image. 

These steps are are shown in the Azure App Service repo as an example [here](https://github.com/Azure-App-Service/node/tree/master/4.4.7-1).

1. Include the `openssh-server` installation in [`RUN` instruction](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#run) in the Dockerfile for your image and set the password for the root account to `"Docker!"`. 

	> [!NOTE] 
	> This configuration does not allow external connections to the container. SSH can only
	> be accessed via the Kudu / SCM Site, which is authenticated using the publishing
	> credentials.

		```docker
        # ------------------------
        # SSH Server support
        # ------------------------
        RUN apt-get update \ 
		  && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends openssh-server \
		  && echo "root:Docker!" | chpasswd 

2. Add a [`COPY` instruction](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#copy) to the Dockerfile to copy a [sshd_config](http://man.openbsd.org/sshd_config) file to the */etc/ssh/* directory. Your configuration file should be based on our sshd_config file in the Azure-App-Service GitHub repo [here](https://github.com/Azure-App-Service/node/blob/master/6.9.3-1/sshd_config).

	> [!NOTE] 
	> The *sshd_config* file must include the following or the connection fails: 
	> * `Ciphers` must include at least one of the following: `aes128-cbc,3des-cbc,aes256-cbc`.
	> * `MACs` must include at least one of the following: `hmac-sha1,hmac-sha1-96`.

		```docker
		COPY sshd_config /etc/ssh/


3. Include port 2222 in the [`EXPOSE` instruction](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#expose) for the Dockerfile. Although the root password is known, port 2222 cannot be accessed from the internet. It is an internal only port accessible only by containers within the bridge network of a private virtual network.

		```docker
		EXPOSE 2222 80

4. Make sure to start the ssh service. The example [here](https://github.com/Azure-App-Service/node/blob/master/6.9.3-1/init_container.sh) uses a shell script in */bin* directory.

		```bash
		#!/bin/bash
		service ssh start

	The Dockerfile uses the [`CMD` instruction](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#cmd) to run the script.

		```docker
		COPY init_container.sh /bin/
		...
		RUN chmod 755 /bin/init_container.sh 
		...		
		CMD ["/bin/init_container.sh"]
