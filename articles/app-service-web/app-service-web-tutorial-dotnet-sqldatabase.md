# Create a data-driven ASP.NET app with Azure with SQL Database

This tutorial shows you how to get started in developing a data-driven ASP.NET application in [Azure App Service](../app-service/app-service-value-prop-what-is.md). Connect your application to Azure SQL Database in just a few minutes, and enable your data-driven functionality with minimal configuration.

![Published ASP.NET application in Azure web app](./media/app-service-web-get-started-dotnet/published-azure-web-app.png)

## Before you begin

Install [Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) with the Azure workload.

## Create an ASP.NET application

In Visual Studio, create a new project with `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`N`.

In the **New Project** dialog, click **Visual C# > Web > ASP.NET Web Application (.NET Framework)**.

Name the application **myWebAppWithSqlDb**, and then click **OK**.
   
![New Project dialog box](./media/app-service-web-get-started-dotnet/new-project.png)

Select the **MVC** template. Then, change authentication to Individual User Accounts by clicking **Change Authentication > Individual User Accounts > OK**.

This template uses [ASP.NET Entity Framework](https://docs.microsoft.com/aspnet/entity-framework) to manage user profiles in the web application. 

Click **OK**

![New ASP.NET Project dialog box](./media/app-service-web-get-started-dotnet/select-mvc-template.png)

Once the project is created, the project overview page is opened. 

## Test data-driven functionality

Type `F5` to run the application in the browser.

In the homepage, click **Register** and follow the on-page instructions to register a dummy user.

Once registered, you should see **Hello &lt;user_name>!** in place of **Register**. This change indicates that database connectivity is working.

![New ASP.NET Project dialog box](./media/app-service-web-get-started-dotnet/user-registered.png)

Your app is only connected to the [LocalDB](https://docs.microsoft.com/sql/database-engine/configure-windows/sql-server-2016-express-localdb) instance on your machine. Azure SDK will help you create the SQL Database in Azure as well as connect your Azure web app to it in the same integrated wizard.

## Open the Create App Service dialog

In the project overview page, click **Publish > Microsoft Azure App Service > Publish**.

![Publish from project overview page](./media/app-service-web-get-started-dotnet/publish-to-azure.png)

If you already closed the project overview page, you can return to it from **Solution Explorer** by right-clicking your project and click **Overview**.

## Sign in to Azure

In the **Create App Service** dialog, click **Add an account**, and then sign in to your Azure subscription.
   
![Sign in to Azure](./media/web-sites-dotnet-get-started/configuresitesettings.png)

## Configure resources your Azure web app needs

Once signed in, configure the App Service resources with the following settings:

- **Web App Name**: Use the autogenerated name. The SDK makes sure that it is unique.
- **Subscription**: Skip unless you have multiple subscriptions. 
- **Resource Group**: Click **New**, name the new resource group **myResourceGroup**, and click **OK**.
- **App Service Plan**: Click **New**, configure the App Service plan, and click **OK**.
    - **App Service Plan**: Use the autogenerated name. 
    - **Location**: Choose **West Europe** (or any other region you like).
    - **Size**: Choose **Free** (or any other [pricing tier](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/app-service/) you like).

> [!NOTE]
> A _resource group_ is a logical container into which Azure resources like web apps, databases and storage accounts are deployed and managed.
>
> An _App Service plan_ represents the collection of physical resources used to host your apps. All applications assigned to an App Service plan share the resources defined by it allowing you to save cost when hosting multiple apps.
>
> App Service plans define:
> 
> - Region (North Europe, East US, Southeast Asia)
> - Instance Size (Small, Medium, Large)
> - Scale Count (one, two or three instances, etc.) 
> - SKU (Free, Shared, Basic, Standard, Premium)
>

Don't click **Create** yet. Your **Create App Service** dialog show now look like the following screenshot:

![Configure Azure resources for web app](./media/app-service-web-get-started-dotnet/configure-app-resources.png)

## Configure a SQL Database

Click **Explore additional Azure services**.

In the **Services** tab, click the **+** sign next to **SQL Database**. 

In the **Configure SQL Database** dialog, click **New** for a new database instance. Configure this server instance and click **OK**.

The rest of the dialog is now automatically filled. You can accept the default values. 

> [!NOTE]
> **Connection String Name** is set to **DefaultConnection** by default, which is the default connection string name for your ASP.NET application. You can find this connection string name in `Web.config`. 
>
> The value in **Connection String Name** allows the Azure .NET SDK to create a connection string specific to your Azure SQL Database in the Azure web app. When deployed to Azure, your ASP.NET application knows to use this SQL Database connection string instead of the one configured in `Web.config`. However, if the DbContext in your code uses a different connection string name, you should change this value in the dialog accordingly. 
>

## Create and publish the web app

Click **Create**. 

Once the wizard finishes creating the Azure resources, it automatically publishes your ASP.NET application to Azure for the first time, and then launches the published Azure web app in your default browser.

Congratulations, your first ASP.NET web app is running live in Azure App Service.
