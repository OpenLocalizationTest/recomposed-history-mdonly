# Create a web app and deploy code from a local Git repository

This sample script creates a web app in App Service with its related resources, and then deploys your web app code in a local Git repository.

Before running this script, ensure that a connection with Azure has been created using the `az login` command, and that your application code is committed into a local Git repository.

This sample works in a Bash shell. For options on running Azure CLI scripts on Windows client, see [Running the Azure CLI in Windows](../../virtual-machines/virtual-machines-windows-cli-options.md).
