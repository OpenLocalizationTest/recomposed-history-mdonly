# Create a web app with continuous deployment from GitHub

This sample script creates a web app in App Service with its related resources, and then sets up continuous deployment from a GitHub repository. For GitHub deployment without continuous deployment, see [Create a web app and deploy code from GitHub](app-service-cli-deploy-github.md).

Before running this script, ensure the following:

- A connection with Azure has been created using the `az login` command.
- The application code is in a public or private GitHub repository that you own.
- You have [created an access token in your GitHub account](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-access-token-for-command-line-use/).

This sample works in a Bash shell. For options on running Azure CLI scripts on Windows client, see [Running the Azure CLI in Windows](../../virtual-machines/virtual-machines-windows-cli-options.md).
