# Assign a custom domain to a web app

This sample script creates a web app in App Service with its related resources, and then maps `www.<yourdomain>` to it. 

Before running this script, ensure that a connection with Azure has been created using the `Login-AzureRmAccount` cmdlet, and that you have access to your domain registrar's DNS configuration page.

## Sample script

[!code-powershell[main](../../../powershell_scripts/app-service/map-custom-domain/map-custom-domain.ps1?highlight=3 "Assign a custom domain to a web app")]

## Clean up deployment 

After the script sample has been run, the follow command can be used to remove the Resource Group, web app, and all related resources.

```powershell
Remove-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name myResourceGroup -Force
```
