# Create a web app with continuous deployment from Visual Studio Team Services

This sample script creates a web app in App Service with its related resources, and then sets up continuous deployment from a Visual Studio Team Services repository. 

If needed, install the Azure CLI using the instruction found in the [Azure CLI installation guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). Also, ensure that:

- A connection with Azure has been created using the `az login` command.
- The application code is in a Visual Studio Team Services repository that you own.
- You have [created an access token in your Visual Studio Team Services account](https://www.visualstudio.com/docs/setup-admin/team-services/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate).

This sample works in a Bash shell. For options on running Azure CLI scripts on Windows client, see [Running the Azure CLI in Windows](../../virtual-machines/windows/cli-options.md).
