# Scale a web app worldwide with a high-availability architecture

In this scenario you will create a resource group, two app service plans, two web apps, a traffic manager profile, and two traffic manager endpoints. Once the exercise is complete you will have a high-available architecture which allows provides global availability of your web app based on the lowest network latency.

If needed, install the Azure PowerShell using the instruction found in the [Azure PowerShell guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/azureps-cmdlets-docs/), and then run `Login-AzureRmAccount` to create a connection with Azure.

## Sample script

[!code-powershell[main](../../../powershell_scripts/app-service/scale-geographic/scale-geographic.ps1 "Scale a web app worldwide with a high-availability architecture")]

## Clean up deployment 

After the script sample has been run, the following command can be used to remove the resource group, web app, and all related resources.

```powershell
Remove-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name myResourceGroup -Force
```

## Script explanation

This script uses the following commands. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.
