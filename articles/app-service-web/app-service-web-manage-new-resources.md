## Manage your new Azure web app

Go to the Azure portal to take a look at the web app you just created.

To do this, sign in to [https://portal.azure.com](https://portal.azure.com).

From the left menu, click **App Services**, then click the name of your Azure web app.

You have landed in your web app's _blade_ (a portal page that opens horizontally).

By default, your web app's blade shows the **Overview** page. This page gives you a view of how your app is doing. Here, you can also perform basic management tasks like browse, stop, start, restart, and delete. The tabs on the left side of the blade shows the different configuration pages you can open.

These tabs in the blade show the many great features you can add to your web app. The following list gives you just a few of the possibilities:

* Map a custom DNS name
* Bind a custom SSL certificate
* Configure continuous deployment
* Scale up and out
* Add user authentication
