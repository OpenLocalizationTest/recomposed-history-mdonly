# Using .NET Core in Azure Web App on Linux #

[!INCLUDE [app-service-linux-preview](../../includes/app-service-linux-preview.md)]


With the latest update to our backend, we introduced support for .NET Core v.1.0 and .NET Core v.1.1. We will support .NET Core v.2.0 soon. By setting the configuration of your Linux web app, you can change the application stack.

## Prerequisites ##

* **.NET Core SDK** is installed from [Download .NET Core](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download/core) to your local machine.

* [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) is installed on your development machine
* An [active Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/)

## Step 1 - Creating a .NET Core app ##

First you need to create an empty web app. Log in to the Azure portal at [https://portal.azure.com/](https://portal.azure.com/) and navigate through as shown in the following image:

![Creating a web app][1]

When the Create blade opens, click **Configuration container** and choose either .Net Core 1.0 or 1.1 from **Runtime Stack**, depending on which runtime stack that your app is using:

![Choosing a .NET Core runtime stack][2]

Click **OK** to close the Docker Container blade and fill out the Create blade. Press **Create** to start creating an app.

## Step 2 - Create a local .NET Core application (from Command Line) ##

1. Start a new command-line session. If your machine is Windows, press **Windows** + **R** key, followed by typing either `cmd` or `powershell`. If your machine is Linux or Mac, start a terminal session. In this document, we use a Linux machine.

1. Create a directory named your project and change the current directory to it. Then type `dotnew new web`. The following example is creating a project named **hellodotnetcore**.

![Creating a .NET Core app][3]

The previous command creates three files (`hellodotnetcore.csproj`, `Program.cs`, and `Startup.cs`) and one empty folder (`wwwroot/`) under the current directory. The content of csproj file is something like the following (Note: empty lines are omitted):

        <Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk.Web">
          <PropertyGroup>
            <TargetFramework>netcoreapp1.1</TargetFramework>
          </PropertyGroup>
          <ItemGroup>
            <Folder Include="wwwroot\" />
          </ItemGroup>
          <ItemGroup>
            <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore" Version="1.1.2" />
          </ItemGroup>
        </Project>

In the previous example, .NET Core 1.1 is specified as the framework version with the `<TargetFramework>` tag at line 3. If you want a specific framework version, use `--framework` option (Not available to all platforms):

        dotnet new web --framework netcoreapp1.0

To find out which operating systems and versions are supported by .NET Core, visit [.NET Core Roadmap](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/roadmap.md).

Since this app is a web application, a reference to an ASP.NET Core package was automatically added to the hellodotnetcore.csproj file. The version number of the package is set according to the chosen framework. This example is referencing ASP.NET Core version 1.1.2 because .NET Core 1.1 is used.

## Step 3 - Building and testing the application locally (Optional) ##

Although it is not mandatory, it is always better to test your application locally before deploying it to cloud. So, let's build it on your local machine.

First, build your .NET Core app by resolving depending on packages followed by building it. Type `dotnet restore` and if it succeeds then type `dotnet build`. The following screenshot shows a command line doing the two commands together:

![Building your .NET Core application][4]

Once built, run it on your local machine to confirm it works. In the previous case, you can do it by typing `dotnet bin/Debug/netcoreapp1.1/hellodotnetcore.dll` because the DLL was built under `bin/Debug/netcoreapp1.1/`. This directory structure is consistent across operating systems except that you can use backslash characters instead of forward slashes if your machine is Windows, as you know.

Windows:

        dotnet bin\Debug\netcoreapp1.1\hellodotnetcore.dll

Unix/Linux/Mac/Windows (Yes, Windows actually accepts forward slashes as well):

        dotnet bin/Debug/netcoreapp1.1/hellodotnetcore.dll

When the application starts, you see a message indicating the app is listening to incoming requests at a port. Test it by executing cURL in another terminal session, or browse *http://localhost:5000/* with your browser. If everything works fine, you see "Hello World!" as the result text.

## Step 4 - Deploying your application via git ##

In this tutorial, we use **Git** to deploy the .NET Core application to Azure App Service Web App on Linux.

1. The new Azure website already has a Git deployment configured. You will find the Git deployment URL by navigating to the following URL after inserting your web app name:

		https://{your web app name}.scm.azurewebsites.net/api/scm/info

	The Git URL has the following form based on your web app name:

		https://{your web app name}.scm.azurewebsites.net/{your web app name}.git

1. Run the following commands to deploy the local application to your Azure website. You don't need to push any files under **bin/** or **obj/** directories because your application is built in the cloud when pushing your application. After the build process is complete, binary files are copied into the application's directory at **/home/site/wwwroot/**. 

        git init
        git remote add azure <Git deployment URL from above>
        git add *.csproj *.cs
        git commit -m "Initial deployment commit"
        git push master

1. Confirm that the remote deployment operations report success. Push operations may take a while since package resolution and build process run in the cloud.

![Pushing the application to the cloud][8]

1. Once the deployment has completed, restart your web app for the deployment to take effect. In the Azure portal, navigate to the **Overview** blade of your web app. Press the **Restart** button in the blade. When a popup window shows up, press **Yes** to confirm.

1. Browse your web app or refresh the web app. If your application isn't displayed correctly (For example, 404 Not Found Error), Azure may have failed to locate your DLL. In this case, you need to manually provide the main DLL filename from the portal. Navigate to **Docker Container** of your web app, update **Startup File** and press **Save**. Restart your web app again.

        dotnet your_application_name.dll
