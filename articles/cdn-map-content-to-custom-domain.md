#How to Map Content Delivery Network (CDN) Content to a Custom Domain

You can map a custom subdomain to a Content Delivery Network (CDN) endpoint in order to use your own domain name in URLs to cached content, rather than the CDN endpoint provided for you.  
  
There are two ways to map your custom domain to a CDN endpoint. The simplest way is to create a CNAME record with your domain registrar that maps your custom domain and subdomain to the CDN endpoint. A CNAME record is a DNS feature that maps a source domain to a destination domain. In this case, the source domain is your custom domain and subdomain â€” note that the subdomain is always required. The destination domain is your CDN endpoint.  

The process of mapping your custom domain to your CDN endpoint can, however, result in a brief period of downtime for the domain while you are registering the domain in the Azure Management Portal. If your custom domain is currently supporting an application with a service-level agreement (SLA) that requires that there be no downtime, then you can use the Azure **cdnverify** subdomain to provide an intermediate registration step so that users will be able to access your domain while the DNS mapping takes place.  

> AZURE.NOTE

-	You must create a CNAME record with your domain registrar to map your domain to the CDN endpoint. CNAME records map a specific subdomain such as www.mydomain.com or myblog.mydomain.com. It is not possible to map a CNAME record to a root domain, such as mydomain.com.
-	You must associate a dedicated subdomain with a CDN endpoint. The CNAME record that you create will route all traffic addressed to the subdomain to the specified endpoint. For example, if you associate the subdomain www.mydomain.com with your CDN endpoint, then you cannot associate that subdomain with any other kind of Azure endpoint, such as a storage account endpoint or a cloud service endpoint. However, you can use different subdomains on the same domain for different service endpoints. And you can also map different subdomains to the same CDN endpoint.

The procedures in this topic will show you how to:    

-	[Register a custom domain for an Azure CDN endpoint](#subheading1)
-	[Register a custom domain for an Azure CDN endpoint using the intermediary cdnverify subdomain](#subheading2)
-	[Verify that the custom subdomain references your CDN endpoint](#subheading3) 

##<a name="subheading1"></a>Register a custom domain for an Azure CDN endpoint

1.	Log into the [Azure Management Portal](http://manage.windowsazure.com/).
2.	In the navigation pane, click **CDN**.
3.	From the list view, click the name of the CDN endpoint with which you want to associate the subdomain, to navigate to the detail page for that endpoint.
4.	On the ribbon, click **Manage Domains** to display the **Manage custom domains** dialog box. In the text of the dialog box, you'll see the host name, derived from your CDN endpoint, to use in creating a new CNAME record. The format of the host name address will appear as **az#####.vo.msecnd.net** (where **az#####** is the identifier for your CDN endpoint). You can copy this host name to use in creating the CNAME record.  
For this procedure, ignore the text that refers to the **cdnverify** subdomain.
5.	Navigate to your domain registrar's web site, and locate the section for creating DNS records. You might find this in a section such as **Domain Name**, **DNS**, or **Name Server Management**.
6.	Find the section for managing CNAMEs. You may have to go to an advanced settings page and look for the words CNAME, Alias, or Subdomains.
7.	Create a new CNAME record that maps your chosen subdomain (for example, **www** or **cdn**) to the host name provided in the **Manage custom domains** dialog.
8.	Return to the **Manage custom domains** dialog, and enter your custom domain, including the subdomain, in the dialog box. For example, enter the domain name in the format www.mydomain.com or cdn.mydomain.com.   

	Azure will verify that the CNAME record exists for the domain name you have entered. If the CNAME is correct, your custom domain is validated and ready to use with your CDN content.  

	Note that in some cases it can take time for the CNAME record to propagate to name servers on the Internet. If your domain is not validated immediately, and you believe the CNAME record is correct, then wait a few minutes and try checking the domain again.

##<a name="subheading2"></a>Register a custom domain for an Azure CDN endpoint using the intermediary cdnverify subdomain  


1.	Log into the [Azure Management Portal](http://manage.windowsazure.com/).
2.	In the navigation pane, click **CDN**.
3.	From the list view, click the name of the CDN endpoint with which you want to associate the subdomain, to navigate to the detail page for that endpoint.
4.	On the ribbon, click **Manage Domains** to display the **Manage custom domains** dialog box. In the text of the dialog box, you'll see the host name, derived from your CDN endpoint, to use in creating a new CNAME record using the **cdnverify** intermediary subdomain. The format of the host name address will appear as **cdnverify.az#####.vo.msecnd.net**. You can copy this host name to use in creating the CNAME record.
5.	Navigate to your domain registrar's web site, and locate the section for creating DNS records. You might find this in a section such as **Domain Name**, **DNS**, or **Name Server Management**.
6.	Find the section for managing CNAMEs. You may have to go to an advanced settings page and look for the words **CNAME**, **Alias**, or **Subdomains**.
7.	Create a new CNAME record, and provide a subdomain alias that includes the **cdnverify** subdomain. For example, the subdomain that you specify will be in the format **cdnverify.www** or **cdnverify.cdn**. Then provide the host name, which is your CDN endpoint, in the format **cdnverify.az#####.vo.msecnd.net** (where **az#####** is the identifier for your CDN endpoint). The format of the host name is provided for you in the **Manage custom domains** dialog.
8.	Return to the **Manage custom domains** dialog, and enter your custom domain, including the subdomain, in the dialog box. For example, enter the domain name in the format **www.mydomain.com** or **cdn.mydomain.com**. Note that in this step, you do not need to preface the subdomain with **cdnverify**.  

	Azure will verify that the CNAME record exists for the cdnverify domain name you have entered.
9.	At this point, your custom domain has been verified by Azure, but traffic to your domain is not yet being routed to your CDN endpoint. To complete the process, return to your DNS registrar's web site, and create another CNAME record that maps your subdomain to your CDN endpoint. For example, specify the subdomain as **www** or **cdn**, and the hostname as **az#####.vo.msecnd.net**. With this step, the registration of your custom domain is complete. 
10.	Finally, you can delete the CNAME record you created using **cdnverify**, as it was necessary only as an intermediary step.

-	After you have completed the registration of your custom domain, you can access content that is cached at your CDN endpoint using the custom domain.
First, ensure that you have public content that is cached at the endpoint. For example, if your CDN endpoint is associated with a storage account, the CDN caches content in public blob containers. To test the custom domain, ensure that your container is set to allow public access and that it contains at least one blob.
-	In your browser, navigate to the address of the blob using the custom domain. For example, if your custom domain is **www.mydomain.com**, the URL to a cached blob will be similar to the following URL:  
	
		http://www.mydomain.com/mypubliccontainer/acachedblob.jpg
-	If your CDN endpoint is associated with a cloud service, then the address of your cached content will be similar to the following URL:

		http://www.mydomain.com/cdn/mycloudservice
