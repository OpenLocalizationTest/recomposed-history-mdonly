# What is the Azure .NET SDK

The Azure .NET SDK is a collection of Visual Studio tools, command-line tools, and runtime binaries that facilitate developing, testing, and deploying apps that run in Azure. This article details what you get in the SDK.

You can download the SDK from the [Azure Downloads page](/en-us/downloads/).

* [View and manage Cloud Service project settings in Visual Studio Project Properties windows](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee405486.aspx).
* View and manage [Cloud Services](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff683675.aspx), [Virtual Machines](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj131259.aspx), and [Service Bus](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj149828.aspx) in Server Explorer. 
* [Run in debug mode remotely for Cloud Services and Virtual Machines](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff683670.aspx).

###<a id="auth"></a>Microsoft Azure Authoring Tools

**Azure Authoring Tools** includes the following:

* The [CSPack command-line tool](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg432988.aspx) for creating deployment packages.
* Runtime binaries that Cloud Service projects require for communicating with their runtime environment. These binaries are not available in NuGet packages.

###<a id="emulator"></a>Microsoft Azure Emulator

The [Azure Emulator](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn339018.aspx) simulates the Cloud Service environment so that you can test cloud service projects locally.

###<a id="stgemulator"></a>Microsoft Azure Storage Emulator

The [Azure Storage Emulator](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh403989.aspx) uses a LocalDB database to simulate Azure Storage (queues, tables, blobs), so that you can test locally. 

###<a id="stgtools"></a>Microsoft Azure Storage Tools

**Azure Storage Tools** consists of [AzCopy](http://aka.ms/AzCopy), a command line tool for transferring data into and out of an Azure Storage account.

###<a id="libraries"></a>Microsoft Azure Libraries for .NET

**Azure Libraries for .NET** includes the following:

* NuGet packages for Azure Storage, Service Bus, and Caching that are stored on your computer so that Visual Studio can create new cloud service projects while offline.
* A Visual Studio plug-in that enables [In-Role Cache](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn386103.aspx) projects to run locally in Visual Studio. 

###<a id="ls"></a>LightSwitch Azure Publishing add-on for Visual Studio

The [LightSwitch publishing wizard](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj131261.aspx) enables you to publish LightSwitch projects to Azure Websites.

##<a id="notincluded"></a>What isn't included in the SDK

There are a few things that you need for Azure development that aren't included in the .NET SDK. The most important of these are the following:

* [Azure PowerShell](../install-configure-powershell/). 

	Azure PowerShell enables you to [automate Azure environment creation and deployment](http://www.asp.net/aspnet/overview/developing-apps-with-windows-azure/building-real-world-cloud-apps-with-windows-azure/automate-everything).

* [Current client libraries](http://www.nuget.org/packages?q=windowsazureofficial). 

	The Azure .NET SDK copies to your computer the NuGet packages for some Azure client libraries, such as Storage, Service Bus, and Caching. These client libraries are automatically included in new Cloud Service projects, so the local NuGet packages enable Visual Studio to create Cloud Service projects while you're not connected to the Internet.

	Client libraries included in the Azure .NET SDK may be out of date. New versions of the SDK are generally released every couple of months, while client libraries are typically updated more frequently than that. Therefore the client library NuGet packages available online at NuGet.org are generally more current than what you get with the Azure .NET SDK. After creating a project that includes client libraries by default, it's generally a good practice to update the NuGet packages.

	Only [Azure Cloud Service](../cloud-services-dotnet-get-started/) and [Azure Mobile Service](../mobile-services-dotnet-backend-windows-store-dotnet-leaderboard/) project templates automatically include some client libraries. If you need a client library in another project type, such as [ASP.NET Web Application](../web-sites-dotnet-get-started/) or [Microsoft Azure WebJob](../websites-dotnet-deploy-webjobs/), install the NuGet packages you need from [NuGet.org](http://www.nuget.org/packages?q=windowsazureofficial). You can also find the source code for many client libraries at [GitHub.com/Azure](https://github.com/azure/).

##<a id="faq"></a>Frequently Asked Questions

- [Many Azure features are already in Visual Studio. Do I need to install the Azure SDK?](#azinvs)
- [I only want a client library. Do I need to install the Azure SDK?](#clientlib1)
- [Is installing the Azure SDK all I need to do to get a client library?](#clientlib2)

###<a id="azinvs"></a>Many Azure features are already in Visual Studio. Do I need to install the Azure SDK?

In general it's a good practice to install the SDK if you want to develop for Azure using the latest tools. If you want to avoid installing the SDK, you can do so if the following conditions are true:

* You have installed the latest [Visual Studio Update](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=272487).
* You are developing only for Azure Websites or Mobile Services, not for Cloud services or Virtual Machines.
* Your application doesn't use Storage, or it uses Storage but you don't need the Storage Emulator or the AzCopy tool.

###<a id="clientlib1"></a>What's the best way to get an Azure client library?

Install the NuGet package for the client library you want from [NuGet.org](http://www.nuget.org/packages?q=windowsazureofficial). You can also find the source code for many client libraries at [GitHub.com/Azure](https://github.com/azure/). For more information, see [What isn't included in the SDK](#notincluded) earlier in this document.

###<a id="clientlib2"></a>Is installing the Azure SDK all I need to do to get a client library?

Visual Studio includes some client libraries by default in new Cloud Service projects. But those may be out of date, and for other project types you have to install the appropriate NuGet packages manually. For more information, see [What isn't included in the SDK](#notincluded) earlier in this document.
