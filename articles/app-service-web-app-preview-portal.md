# Reference for navigating the preview portal #

## How are the management portal and the preview portal different? ##

Azure Websites is now Web Apps in Azure App Service. At first glance, it is a rebranding of Websites to Web Apps. However, the changes set the foundation to do much more, interconnect the different Azure components and makes navigation and management much easier. 

Documentation is one of our highest priorities, and we will update content to reflect Web Apps and the [preview portal]. While the documentation is getting updated, this document will serve to highlight differences and help you follow our current documentation about features on Azure Websites on the [preview portal]. 

This guide will allow users to follow the documentation and blogs generated by Microsoft and its user community. This document will explain the overall organization of the preview portal compared to the management portal. It will then touch on some of the most common features and use patterns, and provide links to documents that offer more detail. 

## Future of Management Portal ##

While you will notice the branding changes on the management portal, this portal is deprecated. Not only will it be removed later, the Azure team is no longer making investments to it. All upcoming new features for web apps will come in the [preview portal]. To take advantage of the latest and greatest that web apps has to offer, start using the [preview portal] today.

## Layout differences between the management portal and preview portal ##

On the management portal, all the Azure services are listed on the left hand side. Navigation in the management portal follows a tree structure, where you start from the service and navigate into each element. This structure works well when managing independent components. However, applications built on Azure is a collection of services that are interconnected and some services share features. For example, the UI in parts of WebJobs is the same as the UI for Azure Scheduler. 

The preview portal enables users to build applications end-to-end with a series of components. Everything is dynamic, so when feature UI is shared across services, it is much easier to share, manage and organize them. Users are also given the tools to customize their portal experience. The preview portal is organized as *journeys*. A *journey* is the series of *blades*, which are containers for the different components. For example, creating a web app is a *journey* which will take you to web apps *blade*. The components within the *blades* are called *parts*, which look like tiles. This terminology is likely to be found in this and other documentation.

## Navigation examples ##

### How to Create a web app, empty, with databases, or from a gallery of applications. ###

Creating new sites is still as easy as 1-2-3. Notice that, other than layout, not much has changed in the number of steps needed to get a site up and running.

The [preview portal] shows you the most common types of websites, including popular gallery applications like WordPress. For a full list of available applications, visit the [Azure Marketplace].

The same steps are needed, but the preview portal lets you define other common settings. The resource groups make it simple to see and manage related Azure resources. You are able to create custom domains by clicking on **Settings**, then on **Custom domains and SSL**.

### Settings and Features ###

All the settings and features are now logically grouped in a single blade, from which you can navigate.

#### Example: Application Settings #### 

Other than the brand name, other few things in the portal have been renamed to better reflect the content. This effort is made so that customers find what they are looking for more intuitively.
