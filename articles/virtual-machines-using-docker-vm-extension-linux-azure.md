# Using the Docker Virtual Machine Extension for Linux on Azure
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/) is one of the most popular virtualization approaches that uses [Linux containers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LXC) rather than virtual machines as a way of isolating data and computing on shared resources. Using the Docker VM extension to the [Azure Linux Agent](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/virtual-machines-linux-agent-user-guide/), you can create a Docker VM that hosts any number of community containers

[MS Open Tech blog announcement](http://msopentech.com/blog/2014/08/15/getting_started_docker_on_microsoft_azure/)What docker is, what containers are, why you would use one over the other, and so on.
