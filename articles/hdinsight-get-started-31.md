HDInsight makes [Apache Hadoop][apache-hadoop] available as a service in the cloud. It makes the MapReduce software framework available in a simpler, more scalable, and cost efficient Azure environment. HDInsight also provides a cost efficient approach to the managing and storing of data using Azure Blob storage. 

In this tutorial, you will provision an Hadoop cluster in HDInsight using the Azure Management Portal, submit an Hive job to query against a sample Hive table using the HDInsight cluster dashboard, and then import the Hive job output data into Excel for examination.

> [WACOM.NOTE] This tutorial covers using Hadoop 2.4 clusters in HDInsight (preview). For other supported version, click the selector on the top of the page. For version information, see [What's new in the cluster versions provided by HDInsight?][hdinsight-versions]

In conjunction with the general availability of Azure HDInsight, Microsoft has also released HDInsight Emulator for Azure, formerly known as *Microsoft HDInsight Developer Preview*. This product targets developer scenarios and as such only supports single-node deployments. For using HDInsight Emulator, see [Get Started with the HDInsight Emulator][hdinsight-emulator].

**Prerequisites:**

Before you begin this tutorial, you must have the following:


- An Azure subscription. For more information about obtaining a subscription, see [Purchase Options][azure-purchase-options], [Member Offers][azure-member-offers], or [Free Trial][azure-free-trial].
- A computer with Office 2013 Professional Plus, Office 365 Pro Plus, Excel 2013 Standalone, or Office 2010 Professional Plus.
- For notes on the latest HDInsight releases, see [HDInsight Release Notes](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/hdinsight-release-notes/).

##<a name="provision"></a>Provision an HDInsight cluster

HDInsight uses Azure Blob Storage for storing data. It is called *WASB* or *Azure Storage - Blob*. WASB is Microsoft's implementation of HDFS on Azure Blob storage. For more information see [Use Azure Blob storage with HDInsight][hdinsight-storage].

When provision an HDInsight cluster, an Azure Storage account and a specific Blob storage container from that account is designated as the default file system, just like in HDFS. The storage account must be located in the same data center as the HDInsight compute resources. Currently, you can only provision HDInsight clusters in the following data centers:

- Southeast Asia
- North Europe
- West Europe
- East US
- West US

In addition to this storage account, you can add additional storage accounts from either the same Azure subscription or different Azure subscriptions. For instructions on adding additional storage accounts, see [Provision HDInsight clusters][hdinsight-provision]. 

To simply this tutorial, only the default blob container and the default storage account are used, and all of the files are stored in the default file system container, located at */tutorials/getstarted/*. In practice, the data files are usually stored in a designated storage account.


**To create an Azure Storage account**

1. Sign in to the [Azure Management Portal][azure-management-portal].
2. Click **NEW** on the lower left corner, point to **DATA SERVICES**, point to **STORAGE**, and then click **QUICK CREATE**.

	![HDI.StorageAccount.QuickCreate][image-hdi-storageaccount-quickcreate]

3. Enter **URL**, **LOCATION** and **REPLICATION**, and then click **CREATE STORAGE ACCOUNT**. Affinity groups are not supported. You will see the new storage account in the storage list. 
4. Wait until the **STATUS** of the new storage account is changed to **Online**.
5. Click the new storage account from the list to select it.
6. Click **MANAGE ACCESS KEYS** from the bottom of the page.
7. Make a note of the **STORAGE ACCOUNT NAME** and the **PRIMARY ACCESS KEY** (or the **SECONDARY ACCESS KEY**.  Either of the keys works).  You will need them later in the tutorial.


For more information, see
[How to Create a Storage Account][azure-create-storageaccount] and [Use Azure Blob Storage with HDInsight][hdinsight-storage].




















**To provision an HDInsight cluster** 

1. Sign in to the [Azure Management Portal][azure-management-portal]. 

2. Click **HDINSIGHT** on the left to list the HDInsight clusters under your account. In the following screenshot, there is no existing HDInsight cluster.

	![HDI.ClusterStatus][image-hdi-clusterstatus]

3. Click **NEW** on the lower left side, click **DATA SERVICES**, click **HDINSIGHT**, and then click **CUSTOM CREATE**.

	![HDI.CustomCreateCluster][image-hdi-customcreatecluster]

4. From the Cluster Details tab, enter or select the following values:

	<table border="1">
	<tr><th>Name</th><th>Value</th></tr>
	<tr><td><strong>Cluster Name</strong></td><td>Name of the cluster.</td></tr>
	<tr><td><strong>Data Nodes</strong></td><td>Number of data nodes you want to deploy. For testing purposes, create a single node cluster. <br />The cluster size limit varies for Azure subscriptions. Contact Azure billing support to increase the limit.</td></tr>
	<tr><td><strong>HDInsight Version</strong></td><td>Choose <strong>3.1</strong> to create a Hadoop 2.4 cluster on HDInsight.</td></tr>
	<tr><td><strong>Region</strong></td><td>Choose the same region as the storage account you created in the last procedure. HDInsight requires the storage account located in the same region. Later in the configuration, you can only choose a storage account that is in the same region as you specified here.
	</td></tr>
	</table>

4. Click the right arrow in the bottom right corner to configure cluster user. 
4. From the Configure Cluster user tab, enter **User Name** and **Password** for the HDInsight cluster user account. In addition to this account, you can create a RDP user account after the cluster is provisioned, so you can remote desktop into the cluster. For instructions, see [Administer HDInsight using Management portal][hdinsight-admin-portal]
4. Click the right arrow in the bottom right corner to configure the storage account. 
5. From the Storage Account tag, enter or select the following values:

	<table border="1">
	<tr><th>Name</th><th>Value</th></tr>
	<tr><td>STORAGE ACCOUNT</td><td>Select <strong>Use Existing Storage</strong>. You also have the option to have the management portal to create a new storage account if you don't have one created.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>ACCOUNT NAME</td><td>Specify the storage account you created in the last procedure of this tutorial. Note only the storage accounts in the same region are displayed in the list box.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>DEFAULT CONTAINER</td><td>Select <strong>Create defatul container</strong>. When this options is chosen, the default container name has the same name as the cluster name.</td></tr>
	<tr><td>ADDITIONAL STORATGE ACCOUNT</td><td>Select <strong>0</strong>. You have the option to connect the cluster to up to 7 additional storage acounts.</td></tr>
	</table>

5. Click the check icon in the bottom right corner to create the cluster. When the provision process completes, the  status column will show **Running**.














##<a name="sample"></a>Run an Hive job

Now you have an HDInsight cluster provisioned. The next step is to run an Hive job to query a sample Hive table that comes with HDInsight clusters.  The table name is *hivesampletable*.

**To open HDInsight cluster dashboard**

1. Sign in to the [Azure Management Portal][azure-management-portal]. 
2. Click **HDINSIGHT** from the left pane. You shall see a list of clusters created including the one you just created in the last section.
3. Click the cluster name where you want to run the Hive job.
4. Click **MANAGE CLUSTER** from the bottom of the page to open HDInsight cluster dashboard. It opens a Web page on a different browser tab.   
5. Enter the Hadoop User account username and password.  The default username is **admin**, the password is what you entered during the provision process.  The dashboard looks like :

	![hdi.dashboard][img-hdi-dashboard]

	There are several tabs on the top.  The default tab is *Hive Editor*, other tabs include Jobs and Files.  Using the dashboard, you can submit Hive queryes, check Hadoop job logs, and browse WASB files. 

> [wacom.note] Notice is the URL is *&lt;ClusterName&gt;.azurehdinsight.net*. Instead of opening the dashboard from the Management portal, you can also open the dashboard from a Web browser using the URL.

**To run an Hive query**

1. From HDInsight cluster dashboard, click **Hive Editor** from the top.
2. In **Query Name**, enter **HTC20**.  The query name is job title.
3. In the query pane, enter the following query: 

		SELECT * FROM hivesampletable
			WHERE devicemake LIKE "HTC%"
			LIMIT 20;

	![hdi.dashboard.query.select][img-hdi-dashboard-query-select]

4. Click **Submit**. It takes a few moments to get the results back. The screen refreshes every 30 seconds. You can also click **Refresh** to refresh the screen.
 
	Once completed, the screen looks like:

	![hdi.dashboard.query.select.result][img-hdi-dashboard-query-select-result]

	Make a note of **Job Start Time (UTC)**. You will need it later.

	Scroll down a little more, you will see **Job Log**. Job Output is stdout, Job Log is stderr.

5. If you want to reopen the log file again in the future, you can click **Jobs** from the top of the screen, and then click the job title (query name). For example **HTC20** in this case.

**To browse the output file**

1. From HDInsight cluster dashboard, click **Files** from the top.
2. Click **Templeton-Job-Status**.
3. Click the GUID number which has the last Modified time a little after the Job Start Time you wrote down earlier. Make a note of this GUID.  You will need it in the next section.
4. The **stdout** file has the data you need in the next section. You can click **stdout** to download a copy of the data file if you want.
	
##<a name="powerquery"></a>Connect to Microsoft business intelligence tools 

The Power Query add-in for Excel can be used to export output from HDInsight into Excel where Microsoft Business Intelligence (BI) tools can be used to further process or display the results. 

You must have Excel 2010 or 2013 installed to complete this part of the tutorial. 

**To download Microsoft Power Query for Excel**

- Download Microsoft Power Query for Excel from the [Microsoft Download Center](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=39379) and install it.

**To import HDInsight data**

1. Open Excel, and create a new blank workbook.
3. Click the **Power Query** menu, click **From Other Sources**, and then click **From Azure HDInsight**.

	![HDI.GettingStarted.PowerQuery.ImportData][image-hdi-gettingstarted-powerquery-importdata]

3. Enter the **Account Name** of the Azure Blob Storage Account associated with your cluster, and then click **OK**. This is the storage account you created earlier in the tutorial.
4. Enter the **Account Key** for the Azure Blob Storage Account, and then click **Save**. 
5. In the Navigator pane on the right, double-click the Blob storage container name. By default the container name is the same name as the cluster name. 

6. Locate **stdout** in the **Name** column (the path is *.../Templeton-Job-Status/<GUID>*), and then click **Binary** on the left of **stdout**.  The <GUID> must match the one you wrote down in the last section.

	![HDI.GettingStarted.PowerQuery.ImportData2][image-hdi-gettingstarted-powerquery-importdata2]

9. Click **Apply & Close** in the upper left corner. The query then imports the Hive job output into Excel.
