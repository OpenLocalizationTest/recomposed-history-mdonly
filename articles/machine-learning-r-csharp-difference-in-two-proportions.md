#Difference in Proportions Test


Are two proportions statistically different? Suppose a user wants to compare two movies to determine if one movie has a significantly higher proportion of ‘likes’ when compared to the other. With a large sample, there could be a statistically significant difference between the proportions 0.50 and 0.51, while with a small sample there may not be enough data to determine if these proportions are actually different. 

This web service conducts a hypothesis test of the difference in two proportions based on user input of number of successes and total number of trials for the 2 comparison groups. A scenario would be where this web service could be called from within a movie comparison app, telling the user based on movie ratings whether one of the movies is really ‘liked’ more often that the other.

>While this web service could be consumed by users – potentially through a mobile app, website, or even on a local computer for example, the purpose of the web service is also to serve as an example of how Azure ML can be used to create web services on top of R code. With just a few lines of R code and clicks of a button within the Azure ML Studio, a forecasting test experiment can be created with R code and published as a web service. The web service can then be published to the Azure Marketplace and consumed by users and devices across the world with no infrastructure set-up by the author of the web service.


##Consumption of Web Service

This service accepts 4 arguments and does a hypothesis test of proportions.

The input arguments are:

* Successes1: number of success events in sample-1
* Successes2: number of success events in sample-2
* Total1: size of sample-1
* Total2: size of sample-2

The output of the service is the result of the hypothesis test along with the chi-square statistic, df, p-value, proportion in sample-1/2 and confidence interval bounds.

>This service as hosted on the Microsoft Azure Marketplace is an OData service; these may be called through POST or GET methods. 

Two example ways to consume this service are through the creation of a web application that calls the web service in an automated fashion (an example app is [here](http://microsoftazuremachinelearning.azurewebsites.net/DifferenceInProportionsTest.aspx )), or the web service results may be examined in a more exploratory manner on the marketplace through the ‘EXPLORE THIS DATASET’ feature.

###Starting C# code for web service consumption:

	public class Input{
	public double Recency;
	public double Frequency;
	public double Monetary;
	public double Time;
	public double Class;
	}

	public AuthenticationHeaderValue CreateBasicHeader(string username, string password)
    {
        byte[] byteArray = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(username + ":" + password);
        System.Diagnostics.Debug.WriteLine("AuthenticationHeaderValue" + new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Basic", Convert.ToBase64String(byteArray)));
        return new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Basic", Convert.ToBase64String(byteArray));
    }
       
	void Main()
	{
  	var input = new Input(){Recency =1, Frequency=0,Monetary=0,Time=1, Class= 0};
	var json = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(input);
	var acitionUri =  "PutAPIURLHere,e.g.https://api.datamarket.azure.com/..../v1/Score";
       
  	var httpClient = new HttpClient();
   	httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization = CreateBasicHeader("PutEmailAddressHere","ChangeToAPIKey");
   	httpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Accept.Add(new MediaTypeWithQualityHeaderValue("application/json"));
  	var query = httpClient.PostAsync(acitionUri,new StringContent(json));
  	var result = query.Result.Content;
  	var scoreResult = result.ReadAsStringAsync().Result;
  	scoreResult.Dump();
	}

An example of how results can be found in a non-programmatic way through the ‘EXPLORE THIS DATASET’ feature of the Marketplace is displayed below

##Creation of Web Service

>This web service was created using Azure ML. For a free trial, as well as introductory videos on creating experiments and publishing web services, please see azure.com/ml. Below is a screenshots of the experiment that created the web service and example code for each of the modules within the experiment.

From within Azure ML, a new blank experiment was created with two “Execute R Scripts”. In the first module the data schema is defined while the second module uses the prop.test command within R to perform the hypothesis test for 2 proportions. 


###Experiment Flow:

![Experiment flow][2]


####Module 1:
	####Schema definition  
	data.set=data.frame(successes1=50,successes2=60,total1=100,total2=100);
	maml.mapOutputPort("data.set"); #send data to output port
	dataset1 = maml.mapInputPort(1) #read data from input port
	

####Module 2:

	test=prop.test(c(dataset1$successes1[1],dataset1$successes2[1]),c(dataset1$total1[1],dataset1$total2[1])) #conduct hypothesis test

	result=data.frame(
	result=ifelse(test$p.value<0.05,"The proportions are different!",
	"The proportions aren't different statistically."),
	ChiSquarestatistic=round(test$statistic,2),df=test$parameter,
	pvalue=round(test$p.value,4),
	proportion1=round(test$estimate[1],4),
	proportion2=round(test$estimate[2],4),
	confintlow=round(test$conf.int[1],4),
	confinthigh=round(test$conf.int[2],4)) 

	maml.mapOutputPort("result"); #output port
	

##Limitations 

This is a very simple example for test of difference in 2 proportions. As can be seen from the example code above, no error catching is implemented and the service assumes that all the variables are continuous.
