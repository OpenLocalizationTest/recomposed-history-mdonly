# NoSQL vs SQL

SQL Server and relational databases (RDBMS) have been the go-to databases for over 20 years. However, the increased need to process higher volumes and varieties of data at a rapid rate has altered the nature of data storage needs for application developers. In order to enable this scenario, NoSQL databases that enable storing unstructured and heterogeneous data have gained in popularity. 

NoSQL is a category of databases distinctly different from SQL databases. NoSQL means "Not-SQL" or "Not Only SQL". There are a number of technologies in the NoSQL category, including document databases, key value stores, and column family stores, which are popular with gaming, social, and IoT apps.

The goal of this article is to help you learn about the differences between NoSQL and SQL, and provide you with an introduction to the NoSQL and SQL offerings from Microsoft and Microsoft Azure.  

## When to use NoSQL?

Let's imagine you're building a new social media app. Users can create posts and add pictures, videos and music to them. Other users can comment on the posts and give points (likes) to rate the posts. The landing page will have a feed of posts that users can share and interact with. 

So how do you store this data? If you're familiar with SQL, you might start drawing something like this:

![Relational data model for social media app](./media/documentdb-nosql-vs-sql/nosql-vs-sql-social.png)

So far, so good, but now think about the structure of a single post and how to display it. If you want to show the post and the associated images, audio, video, comments, points, and user info on a website or application, you'd have to perform a query with eight table joins just to retrieve the content. Now imagine a stream of posts that dynamically load and appear on the screen and you can easily predict that it's going to require thousands of queries and many joins to complete the task.

Now you could use a relational solution like SQL Server or SQL Data Warehouse to store the data - but there's another option, a NoSQL option that simplifies the approach. By transforming the post into a JSON document like the following and storing it in DocumentDB, an Azure NoSQL document database service, you can retrieve the whole post with one query and no joins. It's a simpler and more straightforward result.

    {
        "id":"ew12-res2-234e-544f",
        "title":"post title",
        "date":"2016-01-01",
        "body":"this is an awesome post stored on NoSQL",
        "createdBy":User,
        "images":["http://myfirstimage.png","http://mysecondimage.png"],
        "videos":[
            {"url":"http://myfirstvideo.mp4", "title":"The first video"},
            {"url":"http://mysecondvideo.mp4", "title":"The second video"}
        ],
        "audios":[
            {"url":"http://myfirstaudio.mp3", "title":"The first audio"},
            {"url":"http://mysecondaudio.mp3", "title":"The second audio"}
        ]
    }

You can then build on this solution using other Azure services:

- [Azure Search](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/search/) can be used via the web app to enable users to search for posts.
- [Azure App Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/) can be used to host applications and background processes.
- [Azure Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/), [Azure SQL Database](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/sql-database/) can be used to store massive amounts of data such as login information, full profiles, and data for usage analytics.
- [Azure Machine Learning](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/machine-learning/)  can be used to build knowledge and intelligence that can provide feedback to the process and help deliver the right content to the right users.

This social media app is just one one scenario in which a NoSQL database is the right data model for the job. If you're interested in reading more about this scenario and how to model your data for DocumentDB in social media applications, see [Going social with DocumentDB](documentdb-social-media-app.md). 

## NoSQL vs SQL comparison

The following table compares the main differences between NoSQL and SQL.

If a NoSQL database best suits your requirements, continue to the next section to learn more about the NoSQL services available from Azure. Otherwise, if a SQL database best suits your needs, skip to [What are the Microsoft SQL offerings?](#what-are-the-microsoft-sql-offerings)

## What are the Microsoft Azure NoSQL offerings?

Azure has four fully-managed NoSQL services: 

- [Azure DocumentDB](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/documentdb/)
- [Azure Table Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/)
- [Azure HBase as a part of HDInsight](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/hdinsight/)
- [Azure Redis Cache](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cache/)

The following comparison chart maps out the key differentiators for each service. Which one most accurately describes the needs of your application? 

![Azure DocumentDB](./media/documentdb-nosql-vs-sql/nosql-vs-sql-documentdb-storage-hbase-hdinsight-redis-cache.png)

If one or more of these services might meet the needs of your application, learn more with the following resources: 

- [DocumentDB learning path](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/learning-paths/documentdb/) and [DocumentDB use cases](documentdb-use-cases.md)
- [Get started with Azure table storage](../storage/storage-dotnet-how-to-use-tables.md)
- [What is HBase in HDInsight](../hdinsight/hdinsight-hbase-overview.md)
- [Redis Cache learning path](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/learning-paths/redis-cache/)

## What are the Microsoft SQL offerings?

Microsoft has four SQL offerings: 

- [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/server-cloud/products/sql-server-2016/)
- [SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-machines/sql-server/)
- [Azure SQL Database](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/sql-database/)
- [Azure SQL Data Warehouse (Preview)](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/sql-data-warehouse/)

If you're interested in SQL Server on a Virtual Machine or SQL Database, then read [Choose a cloud SQL Server option: Azure SQL (PaaS) Database or SQL Server on Azure VMs (IaaS)](../sql-database/data-management-azure-sql-database-and-sql-server-iaas.md) to learn more about the differences between the two.

If SQL Server sounds like the best option, then go to [SQL Server Editions](https://www.microsoft.com/server-cloud/products/sql-server-editions/overview.aspx) to learn more about what the different versions of SQL offer.

Then go to [Next steps](#next-steps) for free trial and evaluation links.
