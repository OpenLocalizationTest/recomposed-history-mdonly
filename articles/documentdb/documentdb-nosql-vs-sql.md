# NoSQL vs SQL Comparison

SQL Server and relational databases (RDBMS) have been the go-to databases for over 20 years. However, the increased need to process higher volumes and varieties of data at a rapid rate has altered the nature of data storage needs for application developers. In order to enable this scenario, NoSQL databases that enable storing unstructured and heterogeneous data have gained in popularity. 

NoSQL is a category of databases and they are distinctly different from SQL databases. NoSQL means "Not-SQL" or "Not Only SQL". There are a number of technologies in the NoSQL category, including document databases, key value stores, and column family stores, which are popular with gaming, social, and IoT apps.

The goal of this article is to help you learn about the differences between NoSQL and SQL, and provide you with an introduction to the NoSQL and SQL offerings from Microsoft and Microsoft Azure.  

## NoSQL vs SQL 

The following table compares the benefits of NoSQL versus SQL. Which one best suits your requirements?

![Azure DocumentDB](./media/documentdb-nosql-vs-sql/nosql-vs-sql-comparison.png)

If a NoSQL database best suits your requirements, continue to the next section to learn more about the NoSQL services available from Azure. Otherwise, if a SQL database best suits your needs, skip to [What are the Microsoft SQL offerings?](#what-are-the-microsoft-sql-offerings)

## What are the Microsoft Azure NoSQL offerings?

Azure has four fully-managed NoSQL services: 

- [Azure DocumentDB](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/documentdb/)
- [Azure Table Storage](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/storage/)
- [Azure HBase as a part of HDInsight](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/hdinsight/)
- [Azure Redis Cache](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cache/)

The following comparison chart maps out the key differentiators for each service. Which one most accurately describes the needs of your application? 

![Azure DocumentDB](./media/documentdb-nosql-vs-sql/nosql-vs-sql-documentdb-storage-hbase-hdinsight-redis-cache.png)

If one or more of these services might meet the needs of your application, learn more with the following resources: 

- [DocumentDB learning path](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/learning-paths/documentdb/) and [DocumentDB use cases](documentdb-use-cases.md)
- [Get started with Azure table storage](../storage/storage-dotnet-how-to-use-tables.md)
- [What is HBase in HDInsight](../hdinsight/hdinsight-hbase-overview.md)
- [Redis Cache learning path](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/learning-paths/redis-cache/)

## What are the Microsoft SQL offerings?

Microsoft has four SQL offerings: 

- [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/server-cloud/products/sql-server-2016/)
- [SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-machines/sql-server/)
- [Azure SQL Database](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/sql-database/)
- [Azure SQL Data Warehouse (Preview)](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/sql-data-warehouse/)

The following comparison charts maps out the key differentiators for each offering. Which one most accurately describes the needs of your application? 

*For comparison, do you like the info in a text table like this - or is the image table better?*

|**Pricing**|License based on SQL Server edition|Size of virtual machine, time usage, and license based on SQL Server edition. SQL VM images licensing built into VM pricing|For single databases, based on service tier and performance level. For elastic database pools, based on performance level and usage|TBD|

If SQL Server on a Virtual Machine or SQL Database sound like the best options, then read [Choose a cloud SQL Server option: Azure SQL (PaaS) Database or SQL Server on Azure VMs (IaaS)](../sql-database/data-management-azure-sql-database-and-sql-server-iaas.md) to learn more about the differences between the two.

If SQL Server sounds like the best option, then go to [SQL Server Editions](https://www.microsoft.com/server-cloud/products/sql-server-editions/overview.aspx) to learn more about what the different versions of SQL offer.
