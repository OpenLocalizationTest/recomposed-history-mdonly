# Azure Cosmos DB: Connect to Xamarin using .NET

This quick start demonstrates how to use the Azure portal, [Xamarin](https://www.xamarin.com/), and [.NET](documentdb-sdk-dotnet.md) to connect to an Azure Cosmos DB account, create a database and collection, and then build and deploy a Xamarin app.


<!---This quick start uses as its starting point the resources created in one of these quick starts: 

- [Create account - Portal](documentdb-get-started-portal.md)
- [Create account - CLI](documentdb-automation-resource-manager-cli-nodejs.md)
- [Create account - PowerShell](documentdb-manage-account-with-powershell.md)
-->
## Before you begin

This tutorial demonstrates how to use Visual Studio 2017 to build and deploy an ASP.NET web app to Azure. If you donâ€™t already have Visual Studio 2017 installed, you can download and use the **free** [Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/). Make sure that you enable **Azure development** during the Visual Studio setup.

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

## Add a collection

Add a collection in the Azure portal. 

1. Log in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. On the left-hand menu, click ![The More services button](./media/documentdb-connect-xamarin-dotnet/azure-documentdb-more-services.png) at the bottom, type **DocumentDB** in the search box, and then click **NoSQL (DocumentDB)**.
3. In the **NoSQL (DocumentDB)** page, select the Azure Cosmos DB account to add collections to.
4. On the account page, on the left-hand menu, click **Quick start**.
5. On the Quick start page, click the **Xamarin** tab, in the Step 1 area, click **Create 'Items' Collection**. Or if you've already created the Items collection from a different quickstart tab, then proceed to step 6.

    Once the collection has been created, the text in the Step 1 area changes to `"Items" collection has been created with 10GB storage capacity and 400 Request Units/sec (RUs) throughput capacity, for up to 400 reads/sec. Estimated hourly bill: $0.033 USD.`

6. In the Step 2 area, click **Download**. When asked if you want to open or save DocumentDB-Quickstart-Xamarin.zip, click **Save** and then click **Open**. 

7. In File Explorer, extract the contents of the zip file. 

8. Open the DocumentDBTodo.sln solution in Visual Studio 2017.
    
## Build and deploy the web app

Build and deploy the sample app, then add some sample data to store in Azure Cosmos DB.

1. In Visual Studio 2017, press CTRL + F5 to run the application. 

    The sample application is displayed in your browswer.

2. Click **Create New** in the browser and create a few new tasks in your to-do app.

## Query data in the Data Explorer in the Azure portal

Once you've added a few sample tasks to your todo app, you can use the Data Explorer (preview) in the Azure portal to view, query, and run business-logic on your data.

* In the Azure portal, in the navigation menu, under **Collections**, click **Data Explorer (Preview)**. In the Data Explorer blade, expand your collection (the ToDoList collection), and then you can view the documents, perform queries, and even create and run stored procedures, triggers, and UDFs.

## Review metrics in the Azure portal

Use the Azure portal to review the availability, latency, throughput, and consistency of your collection. Each graph that's associated with the [Azure Cosmos DB Service Level Agreements (SLAs)](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/documentdb/) provides a line showing the quota required to meet the SLA and your actual usage, providing you transparency into the performance of your database. Additional metrics such as storage usage, number of requests per minute are also included in the portal

* In the Azure portal, in the left menu, under **Monitoring**, click **Metrics**.
