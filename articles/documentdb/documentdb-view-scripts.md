# Create and run stored procedures, triggers, and user-defined functions using the DocumentDB Script Explorer

This article provides an overview of the [Microsoft Azure DocumentDB](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/documentdb/) Script Explorer, an Azure Portal tool that enables you to view DocumentDB server-side programming artifacts including stored procedures, triggers, and user-defined functions.  Read more about DocumentDB server-side programming [here](documentdb-programming.md).

By completing this tutorial, you'll be able to answer the following questions:  

-	How can I easily view, edit, and create DocumentDB stored procedures via a web browser?
-	How can I easily view and edit DocumentDB triggers via a web browser?
-	How can I easily view and edit DocumentDB user-defined functions via a web browser?

## Launch Script Explorer

Script Explorer can be launched from any of the DocumentDB account, database, and collection blades.  

1. At the top of the DocumentDB account, database, or collection blade, simply click the **Script Explorer** command.

2. <p>The **Database** and **Collection** drop-down list boxes are pre-populated depending on the context in which you launch Script Explorer.  For example, if you launch from a database blade, then the current database is pre-populated.  If you launch from a collection blade, then the current collection is pre-populated.

3. The **Database** and **Collection** drop-down list boxes can be used to easily change the collection from which scripts are currently being viewed without having to close and re-launch Script Explorer.  

4. Script Explorer also supports filtering the currently loaded set of scripts by their id property.  Simply type in the filter box and the results in the Script Explorer list are filtered based on your supplied criteria.

	> [AZURE.IMPORTANT] The Script Explorer filter functionality only filters from the ***currently*** loaded set of scripts and does not automatically refresh the currently selected collection.

5. To refresh the list of scripts loaded by Script Explorer, simply click the **Refresh** command at the top of the blade.

	> [AZURE.NOTE] The timestamp (_ts) property is internally represented as epoch time, but Script Explorer displays the value in a human readable GMT format.

- To delete a script, select it in Script Explorer and click the **Delete** command.

## Execute stored procedures with Script Explorer

Script Explorer allows you to execute server-side stored procedures.

- When initially opening create stored procedure, a default script *prefix* is provided. Add an id and your input parameter. For multiple parameters, the inputs must be within an array (e.g. *["foo", "bar"]*).

	![Screenshot of Script Explorer script properties view](./media/documentdb-view-scripts/scriptexploreraddinput.png)

- To execute a script, simply click on the **Save & Execute** command within script editor pane.

	> [AZURE.NOTE] The **Save & Execute** command will save your stored procedure before executing, which will overwrite the previous version of the stored procedure.

	![Screenshot of Script Explorer script properties view](./media/documentdb-view-scripts/scriptexplorerexecsproc.png)

- Successful stored procedure executions will have a *Successfuly saved and executed the stored procedure* status and the returned results will be populated in the *Results* pane.

- If the execution encounters an error, the error will be populated in the *Results* pane.
