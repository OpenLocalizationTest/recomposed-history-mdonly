Sample projects that perform common operations on DocumentDB resources are included in the [azure-documentdb-js-server](https://github.com/Azure/azure-documentdb-js-server) GitHub repository. This article lists the tasks performed on each resource in the sample, and provides links to the related reference content.

**Prerequisites**

You need an Azure account to use these samples:

- You can [open an Azure account for free](/pricing/free-trial/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F): You get credits you can use to try out paid Azure services, and even after they're used up you can keep the account and use free Azure services, such as Websites. Your credit card will never be charged, unless you explicitly change your settings and ask to be charged.
- You can [activate MSDN subscriber benefits](/pricing/member-offers/msdn-benefits-details/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F): Your MSDN subscription gives you credits every month that you can use for paid Azure services.
