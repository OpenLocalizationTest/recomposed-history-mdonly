# DocumentDB protocol support for MongoDB

Azure DocumentDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service built for fast and predictable performance, high availability, automatic scaling, and ease of development. Its flexible data model, consistent low latencies, and rich query capabilities make it a great fit for web, mobile, gaming, IoT, and many other applications that need seamless scale.

DocumentDB databases can now be used as the data store for apps written for MongoDB. Using existing [drivers](https://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/drivers/) for MongoDB, applications can easily and transparently communicate with DocumentDB, in many cases by simply changing a connection string.  Using this preview feature, customers can now easily build and run applications in the Azure cloud - leveraging DocumentDB's fully managed and scalable NoSQL databases - while continuing to use familiar skills and tools for MongoDB.

DocumentDB protocol support for MongoDB enables the core MongoDB API functions to Create, Read, Update and Delete (CRUD) data as well as query the database. The currently implemented capabilities have been prioritized based on the needs of common platforms, frameworks, tools, and large scale MongoDB customers evaluating Azure for their cloud platform.
