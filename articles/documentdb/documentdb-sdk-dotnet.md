## Release & Retirement Dates
Microsoft will provide notification at least **12 months** in advance before retiring an SDK in order to smooth the transition to a newer/supported version.

> [AZURE.WARNING]
All versions of the Azure DocumentDB SDK for .NET prior to version **1.0.0** will be retired on **January 15, 2016**, as announced in this [Microsoft Azure DocumentDB Blog post](). Any application attempting to connect to DocumentDB using a retired SDK will be blocked. 

We strongly recommend that you upgrade to the latest version as early as possible. 
It is recommended that you begin application upgrades now in order to avoid being impacted when the earlier service versions are removed.
