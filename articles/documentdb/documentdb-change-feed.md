# Working with the ChangeFeed support in Azure DocumentDB
[Azure DocumentDB](documentdb-introduction.com) is a fast and flexible NoSQL database service that is used for storing high-volume transactional and operational data with predictable single-digit millsecond latency for reads and writes. This makes it well-suited for IoT, gaming, retail, and operational logging applications. A common design pattern in these applications is to track changes made to DocumentDB data, and update materialized views, perform real-time analytics, archive data to cold storage, and trigger notifications on certain events based on these changes. DocumentDB's **ChangeFeed support** allows you to build efficient and scalable solutions for each of these patterns.

With ChangeFeed support, DocumentDB provides a real-time sorted list of changes made to documents within a DocumentDB collection in the order in which it was applied. These changes can be read and processed by a single consumer, or distributed across a number of consumers. Let's take a look at the APIs for ChangeFeed and how you can use this to scale your applications.

# How ChangeFeed works in Azure DocumentDB
DocumentDB provides the ability to incrementally read updates made to a DocumentDB collection. This change log has the following properties:

* Changes to documents within a collection will be available immediately in real-time in the change log with no lag.
* Changes to documents will appear only once in the change log.
* Changes will be ordered by time within each partition key value. There is no guaranteed order across partition-key values.
* Changes can be synchronized from any point-in-time, i.e. there is no time limit/window for which changes are available.
* Only the most recent change for a given document is guaranteed to be included in the change log. Intermediate changes may not be available.
* Changes are available in chunks of partition key ranges. This allows change logs from large collections to be processed in parallel by multiple consumers/servers.
* Changes include inserts and updates to documents. To capture deletes, you must use [TTL expiration for documents](documentb-expire-data.md).

DocumentDB's change log is enabled by default for all accounts, and does not incure any additional costs on your account. You can use your [provisioned throughput](documentdb-request-units.md) in your write region or any [read region](documentdb-distribute-data-globally.md) to read from the change log, just like any other operation from DocumentDB. In the following section, we describe how to acess the change log using the DocumentDB REST API and SDKs.

## Working with the REST API and SDK
DocumentDB provides elastic containers or storage and throughput called **collections**. Data within collections is logically grouped using [partition keys](documentdb-partition-data.md) for scalability and performance. DocumentDB provides various APIs for accessing this data, including lookup by ID (Read/Get), query, and read-feeds (scans). The change log can be obtained by populating two new request headers to DocumentDB's `ReadDocumentFeed` API. 

### ReadDocumentFeed API
Let's take a brief look at how ReadDocumentFeed works. DocumentDB supports reading a feed of documents within a collection via the `ReadDocumentFeed` API. For example, the following request returns a page of documents inside the `serverlogs` collection. 

	GET https://mydocumentdb.documents.azure.com/dbs/smalldb/colls/smallcoll HTTP/1.1
	x-ms-date: Tue, 22 Nov 2016 17:05:14 GMT
	authorization: type%3dmaster%26ver%3d1.0%26sig%3dgo7JEogZDn6ritWhwc5hX%2fNTV4wwM1u9V2Is1H4%2bDRg%3d
	Cache-Control: no-cache
	x-ms-consistency-level: Strong
	User-Agent: Microsoft.Azure.Documents.Client/1.10.27.5
	x-ms-version: 2016-07-11
	Accept: application/json
	Host: mydocumentdb.documents.azure.com

Results can be limited by using the `x-ms-max-item-count` header, and reads can be resumed by resubmitting the request with a `x-ms-continuation` header returned in the previous response. When performed from a single client, `ReadDocumentFeed` iterates through results across partitions serially. 

You can retrieve this information using one of the supported [DocumentDB SDKs](documentdb-sdk-dotnet.md). For example, the following snippet shows how to perform ReadDocumentFeed in .NET.

    FeedResponse<dynamic> feedResponse = null;
    do
    {
        feedResponse = await client.ReadDocumentFeedAsync(collection, new FeedOptions { MaxItemCount = -1 });
    }
    while (feedResponse.ResponseContinuation != null);


**Serial Read Document Feed**

![DocumentDB ReadDocumentFeed serial execution](./media/documentdb-change-feed/ReadDocumentFeedserial.png)

### Distributed Execution of ReadDocumentFeed
For collections that contain terabytes of data or more, or ingest a large volume of updates, serial execution of read feed from a single client machine might not be a practical solution. In order to support these big data scenarios, DocumentDB provides APIs to distribute `ReadDocumentFeed` calls transparently across a number of client readers/consumers. 

**Distributed Read Document Feed**

![DocumentDB ReadDocumentFeed distributed execution](./media/documentdb-change-feed/ReadDocumentFeedparallel.png)

In order to provides scalable processing of incremental changes, DocumentDB supports a scale-out model for the ReadDocumentFeed API based on ranges of partition keys.

* By performing a `ReadPartitionKeyRanges` call on the collection, you can obtain a list of partition key ranges for a collection. 
* For each partition key range, you can perform a `ReadDocumentFeed` to read documents with partition keys within that range.

### Retrieving Partition Key Ranges for a Collection
You can retrive the Partition Key Ranges by requesting the `pkranges` resource within a collection. For example the following request retrieves the list of partition key ranges for the `serverlogs` collection:

	GET https://querydemo.documents.azure.com/dbs/bigdb/colls/serverlogs/pkranges HTTP/1.1
	x-ms-date: Tue, 15 Nov 2016 07:26:51 GMT
	authorization: type%3dmaster%26ver%3d1.0%26sig%3dEConYmRgDExu6q%2bZ8GjfUGOH0AcOx%2behkancw3LsGQ8%3d
	x-ms-consistency-level: Session
	x-ms-version: 2016-07-11
	Accept: application/json
	Host: querydemo.documents.azure.com

This request returns the following response containing metadata about the partition key ranges:

	HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
	Content-Type: application/json
	x-ms-item-count: 25
	x-ms-schemaversion: 1.1
	Date: Tue, 15 Nov 2016 07:26:51 GMT

	{
	   "_rid":"qYcAAPEvJBQ=",
	   "PartitionKeyRanges":[
	      {
	         "_rid":"qYcAAPEvJBQCAAAAAAAAUA==",
	         "id":"0",
	         "_etag":"\"00002800-0000-0000-0000-580ac4ea0000\"",
	         "minInclusive":"",
	         "maxExclusive":"05C1CFFFFFFFF8",
	         "_self":"dbs\/qYcAAA==\/colls\/qYcAAPEvJBQ=\/pkranges\/qYcAAPEvJBQCAAAAAAAAUA==\/",
	         "throughputFraction":0.04,
	         "_ts":1477100776
	      },
	      ...
	   ],
	   "_count": 25
	}


**Partition Key Range Properties**:
Each partition key range inherits properties of its source collection including ETag (`_etag`), ResourceId (`_rid`), and Timestamp (`_ts`). It also includes these metadata properties. The key property retured in `pkranges` is the id property, which is used within ReadDocumentFeed calls to parallelize reads across partitions. 

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Header name</th>
		<th>Description</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>id</td>
		<td>The ID for the partition key range. This is a stable and unique ID within each collection.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>maxExclusive</td>
		<td>The maximum partition key hash value for the partition key range. For internal use.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>minInclusive</td>
		<td>The minimum partition key hash value for the partition key range. For internal use.</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>throughputFraction</td>
		<td>The throughput fraction for the partition . For internal use.</td>
	</tr>		
</table>

You can retrieve this information using one of the supported [DocumentDB SDKs](documentdb-sdk-dotnet.md). For example, the following snippet shows how to retrive partition key ranges in .NET.

    List<PartitionKeyRange> partitionKeyRanges = new List<PartitionKeyRange>();
    FeedResponse<PartitionKeyRange> response;

    do
    {
        response = await client.ReadPartitionKeyRangeFeedAsync(collection);
        partitionKeyRanges.AddRange(response);
    }
    while (response.ResponseContinuation != null);



DocumentDB supports retrieval of documents per partition key range by setting the optional `x-ms-documentdb-partitionkeyrangeid` header. 

### Performing an Incremental ReadDocumentFeed
REST API versions `2016-07-11` and above support reading a change log. ReadDocumentFeed supports the following headers for performing incremental reads, that allow you to perform the following tasks:

* Read all changes to documents from the beginning, i.e. collection creation
* Read all changes to future updates to documents from current time
* Read all changes to documents from a logical version of the collection (ETag). You can checkpoint your consumers based on the returned ETag from incremental read-feed requests.

The following table lists the request and response headers for ReadDocumentFeed operations.

**Request Headers for incremental ReadDocumentFeed**:

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Header name</th>
		<th>Description</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>A-IM</td>
		<td>Must be set to "Incremental feed", or omitted otherwise</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>If-None-Match</td>
		<td>
			No header: returns all changes from the beginning (collection creation)
			"*": returns all new changes to data within the collection
			&lt;etag&gt;: If set to a collection ETag, returns all changes made since that logical timestamp
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>x-ms-documentdb-partitionkeyrangeid</td>
		<td>The partition key range ID for reading data.</td>
	</tr>
</table>

**Response Headers for incremental ReadDocumentFeed**:

<table>
	<tr>
		<th>Header name</th>
		<th>Description</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>etag</td>
		<td>The logical version of data within the collection.</td>
	</tr>
</table>

For example, the following snippet shows how to retrieve all changes from the beginning using the .NET SDK from a single client.

    private async Task<Dictionary<string, string>> GetChanges(
        DocumentClient client,
        string collection,
        Dictionary<string, string> checkpoints)
    {
        Dictionary<string, string> nextCheckpoints = new Dictionary<string, string>();

        List<PartitionKeyRange> partitionKeyRanges = new List<PartitionKeyRange>();
        FeedResponse<PartitionKeyRange> response;

        do
        {
            response = await client.ReadPartitionKeyRangeFeedAsync(collection);
            partitionKeyRanges.AddRange(response);
        }
        while (response.ResponseContinuation != null);

        foreach (PartitionKeyRange pkRange in partitionKeyRanges)
        {
            string continuation = (checkpoints == null) ? null : checkpoints[pkRange.Id];
            IDocumentQuery<Document> query = client.CreateDocumentChangeFeedQuery(
                collection,
                new ChangeFeedOptions
                {
                    PartitionKeyRangeId = pkRange.Id,
                    StartFromBeginning = true,
                    RequestContinuation = continuation,
                    MaxItemCount = 1
                });

            while (query.HasMoreResults)
            {
                FeedResponse<Document> readChangesResponse = query.ExecuteNextAsync<Document>().Result;
                foreach (Document changedDocument in readChangesResponse)
                {
                    Console.WriteLine(changedDocument.Id);
                }

                nextCheckpoints[pkRange.Id] = response.ResponseContinuation;
            }
        }

        return nextCheckpoints;
    }


And the following snippet shows how to process changes in real-time with DocumentDB by using the ChangeFeed support. 

    // Returns all documents in the collection.
    Dictionary<string, string> checkpoints = await GetChanges(client, collection, null);

    client.CreateDocumentAsync(collection, new { id = Guid.NewGuid().ToString() }).Wait();
    client.CreateDocumentAsync(collection, new { id = Guid.NewGuid().ToString() }).Wait();

    // Returns only the two documents created above.
    checkpoints = await GetChanges(client, collection, checkpoints);
