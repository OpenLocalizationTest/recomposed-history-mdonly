# Get DocumentDB connection string for MongoDB apps using the Azure CLI

This sample CLI script creates an Azure DocumentDB account, database and collection. Once the script has been successfully run, the DocumentDB database can be accessed from all Azure services. 

[!INCLUDE [sample-cli-install](../../../includes/sample-cli-install.md)]

## Sample script

`[!code-azurecli[main](../../../cli_scripts/documentdb/secure-documentdb-get-mongodb-connection-string/secure-documentdb-get-mongodb-connection-string.sh?highlight=38-41  "Get a DocumentDB connection string for MongoDB apps")]`

## Clean up deployment

After the script sample has been run, the following command can be used to remove the resource group and all resources associated with it.

```azurecli
az group delete --name myResourceGroup
```

## Script explanation

This script uses the following commands. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.

| Command | Notes |
|---|---|
| [az group create](/cli/azure/group#create) | Creates a resource group in which all resources are stored. |
| [az documentdb update](/cli/azure/documentdb/name#update) | Updates a DocumentDB account. |
| [az documentdb list-connection-strings](/cli/azure/documentdb/list-connection-strings) | Gets the connection string for the account.|
| [az group delete](/cli/azure/resource#delete) | Deletes a resource group including all nested resources. |
