# Azure Cosmos DB: Create a firewall using the Azure CLI

This sample CLI script creates a firewall policy for any kind of Azure Cosmos DB account. 

[!INCLUDE [sample-cli-install](../../../includes/sample-cli-install.md)]

## Sample script

[!code-azurecli[main](../../../cli_scripts/documentdb/secure-documentdb-create-firewall/secure-documentdb-create-firewall.sh?highlight=39-43 "Create an Azure Cosmos DB firewall")]

## Clean up deployment

After the script sample has been run, the following command can be used to remove the resource group and all resources associated with it.

```azurecli
az group delete --name myResourceGroup
```

## Script explanation

This script uses the following commands. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.

| Command | Notes |
|---|---|
| [az group create](/cli/azure/group#create) | Creates a resource group in which all resources are stored. |
| [az documentdb create](/cli/azure/documentdb/name#create) | Creates a DocumentDB account. |
| [az documentdb update](/cli/azure/sql/server#create) | Updates a DocumentDB account to include firewall settings. |
| [az group delete](/cli/azure/resource#delete) | Deletes a resource group including all nested resources. |
