# Create a Document Gremlin graph API account, database, and collection using the Azure CLI

This sample CLI script creates an Azure DocumentDB account, database and collection. Once the script has been successfully run, the DocumentDB database can be accessed from all Azure services. 

[!INCLUDE [sample-cli-install](../../../includes/sample-cli-install.md)]

## Sample script

[!code-azurecli[main](../../../cli_scripts/documentdb/create-documentdb-tables-account/create-documentdb-tables-account.sh?highlight=16-38 "Create an Azure Cosmos DB Tables API account, database, and collection")]

## Clean up deployment

After the script sample has been run, the following command can be used to remove the resource group and all resources associated with it.

```azurecli
az group delete --name myResourceGroup
```

## Script explanation

This script uses the following commands. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.

| Command | Notes |
|---|---|
| [az group create](/cli/azure/group#create) | Creates a resource group in which all resources are stored. |
| [az documentdb create](/cli/azure/sql/server#create) | Creates a DocumentDB account. |
| [az group delete](/cli/azure/resource#delete) | Deletes a resource group including all nested resources. |

## Next steps

For more information on the Azure CLI, see [Azure CLI documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/overview).

Additional Azure Cosmos DB CLI script samples can be found in the [Azure Cosmos DB CLI documentation](../documentdb-cli-samples.md).
