# 1.2 Get the tools (Windows 7 +) 
> [AZURE.SELECTOR]
- [Windows 7 +](iot-hub-raspberrypikit-node-lesson1-get-the-tools-win32.md)
- [Ubuntu 16.04](iot-hub-raspberrypikit-node-lesson1-get-the-tools-ubuntu.md)
- [OS X 10.10](iot-hub-raspberrypikit-node-lesson1-get-the-tools-mac.md)

## 1.2.1 What will you do

Download the development tools and the software for the first sample application for your Raspberry Pi 3.

## 1.2.2 What will you learn
- How to install Git and Node.js
  - [Git](https://git-scm.com) is an open source distributed version control system. The sample application for this lesson is stored on Git.
  - [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) is a JavaScript runtime with a rich package ecosystem.
- How to use NPM to install additional Node.js development tools.
  - The minimum version requirement of Node.js is 4.5 LTS.
  - [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com) is one of the package managers for Node.js.

## 1.2.3 What do you need

- An Internet connection to download the development tools and the software
- A computer that is running Windows

## 1.2.4 Install Git and Node.js

Click the links below to download and install Git and Node.js LTS for Windows.
- [Get Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win/)
- [Get Node.js LTS for Windows](https://nodejs.org/en/)

## 1.2.5 Install additional Node.js development tools

1. Download Gulp and device-discovery-cli.
  - [Get gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com).
    Gulp is a tool to automate the deployment of the sample application to your Pi.
  - [Get device-discovery-cli](https://github.com/Azure/device-discovery-cli).
    `device-discovery-cli` is a Node.js utility to retrieve network information about your Pi.
2. Install these development tools.
  1. Press `Windows + R`, type `cmd` and press Enter to open a command prompt window.
  2. Run the following command:
    ```bash
    npm install -g device-discovery-cli gulp
    ```
If you experience issues installing Node.js and these additional Node.js development tools on your computer, see [troubleshooting guide](iot-hub-raspberrypikit-node-troubleshooting.md) for solutions to common problems.

## 1.2.6 Install Visual Studio Code

[Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/windows) and install Visual Studio Code. Visual Studio Code is a lightweight but powerful source code editor for Windows, Linux and OS X. You use this later in the tutorial to edit the sample application.

## 1.2.7 Summary

You've installed all the required development tools and software for the first sample application. In the next section, you create, deploy, and run the sample application on your Pi.
