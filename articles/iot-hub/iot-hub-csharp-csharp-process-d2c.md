# Tutorial: How to process IoT Hub device-to-cloud messages

## Introduction

Azure IoT Hub is a fully managed service that enables reliable and secure bi-directional communications between millions of IoT devices and an application back end. Other tutorials ([Get started with IoT Hub] and [Send cloud-to-device messages with IoT Hub]) show you how to use the basic device-to-cloud and cloud-to-device messaging functionality of IoT Hub.

This tutorial builds on the code shown in the [Get started with IoT Hub] tutorial, and it shows two scalable patterns that you can use to process device-to-cloud messages:

- The reliable storage of device-to-cloud messages in [Azure Blob storage]. A very common scenario is *cold path* analytics, in which you store telemetry data in blobs to use as input into analytics processes. These processes can be driven by tools such as [Azure Data Factory] or the [HDInsight (Hadoop)] stack.

- The reliable processing of *interactive* device-to-cloud messages. Device-to-cloud messages are interactive when they are immediate triggers for a set of actions in the application back end. For example, a device might send an alarm message that triggers inserting a ticket into a CRM system. By contrast, *data point* messages simply feed into an analytics engine. For example, temperature telemetry from a device that is to be stored for later analysis is a data point message.

Because IoT Hub exposes an [Event Hubs][lnk-event-hubs]-compatible endpoint to receive device-to-cloud messages, this tutorial uses an [EventProcessorHost] instance. This instance:

* Reliably stores *data point* messages in Azure blob storage.
* Forwards *interactive* device-to-cloud messages to an [Azure Service Bus queue] for immediate processing.

Service Bus helps ensure reliable processing of interactive messages, as it provides per-message checkpoints, and time window-based de-duplication.

> [AZURE.NOTE] An **EventProcessorHost** instance is only one way to process interactive messages. Other options include [Azure Service Fabric][lnk-service-fabric] and [Azure Stream Analytics][lnk-stream-analytics].

At the end of this tutorial, you will run three Windows console apps:

* **SimulatedDevice**, a modified version of the app created in the [Get started with IoT Hub] tutorial, sends data point device-to-cloud messages every second, and interactive device-to-cloud messages every 10 seconds. This app uses the AMQPS protocol to communicate with IoT Hub.
* **ProcessDeviceToCloudMessages** uses the [EventProcessorHost] class to retrieve messages from the Event Hubs-compatible endpoint. It then reliably stores data point messages in  Azure Blob storage, and forwards interactive messages to a Service Bus queue.
* **ProcessD2CInteractiveMessages** de-queues the interactive messages from the Service Bus queue.

> [AZURE.NOTE] IoT Hub has SDK support for many device platforms and languages, including C, Java, and JavaScript. For step-by-step instructions on how to replace the simulated device in this tutorial with a physical device, and generally how to connect devices to an IoT Hub, see the [Azure IoT Developer Center].

This tutorial is directly applicable to other ways to consume Event Hubs-compatible messages, such as [HDInsight (Hadoop)] projects. For more information, see [Azure IoT Hub developer guide - Device to cloud].

To complete this tutorial, you'll need the following:

+ Microsoft Visual Studio 2015.

+ An active Azure account. <br/>If you don't have an Azure subscription, you can create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) in just a couple of minutes.

You should have some basic knowledge of [Azure Storage] and [Azure Service Bus].

[AZURE.INCLUDE [iot-hub-process-d2c-cloud-csharp](../../includes/iot-hub-process-d2c-cloud-csharp.md)]

## Run the applications

Now you are ready to run the applications.

1.	In Visual Studio, in Solution Explorer, right-click your solution and select **Set StartUp Projects**. Select **Multiple startup projects**, then select **Start** as the action for the **ProcessDeviceToCloudMessages**, **SimulatedDevice**, and **ProcessD2CInteractiveMessages** projects.

2.	Press **F5** to start the three console applications. The **ProcessD2CInteractiveMessages** application should process every interactive message sent from the **SimulatedDevice** application.

> [AZURE.NOTE] In order to see updates in your blob file, you may need to reduce the **MAX_BLOCK_SIZE** constant in the **StoreEventProcessor** class to a smaller value, such as **1024**. This is because it takes some time to reach the block size limit with the data sent by the simulated device. With a smaller block size, you will not need to wait so long to see the blob being created and updated. However, using a larger block size makes the application more scalable.

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you learned how to reliably process data point and interactive device-to-cloud messages by using the [EventProcessorHost] class.

The [Uploading files from devices] tutorial builds on this tutorial by using analagous message processing logic. It also describes a pattern that makes use of cloud-to-device messages to facilitate file uploads from devices.
