Other reference topics in the Developer Guide include:

- [IoT Hub endpoints][lnk-endpoints] describes the various endpoints that each IoT hub exposes for runtime and management operations.
- [Throttling and quotas][lnk-quotas] describes the quotas that apply to the IoT Hub service and the throttling behavior to expect when you use the service.
- [IoT Hub device and service SDKs][lnk-sdks] lists the various language SDKs you an use when you develop both device and service applications that interact with IoT Hub.
- [Query language for twins, methods, and jobs][lnk-query] describes the query language you can use to retrieve information from IoT Hub about your device twins, methods and jobs.
- [IoT Hub MQTT support][lnk-devguide-mqtt] provides more information about IoT Hub support for the MQTT protocol.
