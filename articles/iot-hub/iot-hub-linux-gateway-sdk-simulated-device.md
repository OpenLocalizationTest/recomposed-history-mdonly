# IoT Gateway SDK â€“ send device-to-cloud messages with a simulated device using Linux

[AZURE.INCLUDE [iot-hub-gateway-sdk-simulated-selector](../../includes/iot-hub-gateway-sdk-simulated-selector.md)]

## Build and run the sample

Before you get started, you must:

- [Set up your development environment][lnk-setupdevbox] for working with the SDK on Linux.
- [Create an IoT hub][lnk-create-hub] in your Azure subscription, you will need the name of your hub to complete this walkthrough. If you don't already have an Azure subscription, you can get a [free account][lnk-free-trial].
- Add two devices to your IoT hub and make a note of their ids and device keys. You can use the [Device Explorer or iothub-explorer][lnk-explorer-tools] tool to add your devices to the IoT hub you created in the previous step and retrieve their keys.

To build the sample:

1. Open a shell.
2. Navigate to the **azure-iot-gateway-sdk/tools/** folder in your local copy of the repository.
3. Run the **build.sh** script.

To run the sample:

In a text editor, open the file **azure-iot-gateway-sdk/samples/simple_device_cloud_upload/src/simple_device_cloud_upload_lin.json** in your local copy of the repository. This file configures the modules in the sample gateway:

- The **IoTHub** module connects to your IoT hub. You must configure it to send data to your IoT hub. Specifically, set the **IoTHubName** value to the name of your IoT hub and set the value of **IoTHubSuffix** to **azure-devices.net**.
- The **mapping** module maps the MAC addresses of your simulated devices to your IoT Hub device ids. Make sure that **deviceId** values match the ids of the two devices you added to your IoT hub, and that the **deviceKey** values contain the keys of your two devices.
- The **BLE1** and **BLE2** modules are the simulated devices. Note how their MAC addresses match those in the **mapping** module.
- The **Logger** module logs your gateway activity to a file.

            }
        },

            {
                "filename":"deviceCloudUploadGatewaylog.log"
            }
        }
    ]
}

```

Save any changes you made to the configuration file.

To run the sample:

1. In your shell, navigate to the **build** folder in your local copy of the repository.
2. Run the following command:

    ```
    ./samples/device_cloud_upload/device_cloud_upload {Path to your local copy of the repository}/azure-iot-field-gateway-sdk/samples/device_cloud_upload/src/device_cloud_upload_lin.json
    ```

3. You can use the [Device Explorer or iothub-explorer][lnk-explorer-tools] tool monitor the messages that IoT hub receives from the gateway.
