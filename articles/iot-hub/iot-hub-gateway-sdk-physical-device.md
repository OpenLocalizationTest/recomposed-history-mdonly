# IoT Gateway SDK (beta) â€“ send device-to-cloud messages with a real device using Linux

This walkthrough of the [Bluetooth low energy sample][lnk-ble-samplecode] shows you how to use the [Microsoft Azure IoT Gateway SDK][lnk-sdk] to forward device-to-cloud telemetry to IoT Hub from a physical device and how to route commands from IoT Hub to a physical device.

This walkthrough covers:

1. **Architecture**: important architectural information about the Bluetooth low energy sample.

2. **Build and run**: the steps required to build and run the sample.

## Architecture

The walkthrough shows you how to build and run an IoT Gateway on an Intel Edison Compute Module that runs Linux. The gateway is built using the IoT Gateway SDK. The sample uses a Texas Instruments SensorTag device to collect temperature data.

When you run the gateway it:

- Connects to a SensorTag device using the Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) protocol.
- Connects to IoT Hub using the AMQP protocol.
- Forwards telemetry from the SensorTag device to IoT Hub.
- Routes commands from IoT Hub to the SensorTag device.

The gateway contains the following modules:

- A *BLE module* that interfaces with a BLE device to receive temperature data from the device and send commands to the device.
- A *logger module* that produces message bus diagnostics.
- An *identity mapping module* that translates between BLE device MAC addresses and Azure IoT Hub device identities.
- An *IoT Hub HTTP module* that uploads telemetry data to an IoT hub and receives device commands from an IoT hub.
- A *BLE printer module* that interprets telemetry from the BLE device and prints formatted data to the console to enable troubleshooting and debugging.

### How data flows through the Gateway

The following block diagram illustrates the telemetry upload data flow pipeline:

Here are the steps in the journey that an item of telemetry takes from a BLE
device to IoT Hub.

1. The BLE device generates a temperature sample and sends it over Bluetooth to the BLE module in the gateway.
2. The BLE module receives the sample and publishes it to the message bus along with the MAC address of the device.
3. The identity mapping module picks up this message from the message bus and uses an internal table to translate the MAC address of the device into an IoT Hub device identity (a device ID and device key). It then publishes a new message to the message bus that contains the temperature sample data, the MAC address of the device, the device ID, and the device key.
4. The IoT Hub HTTP module receives this new message (generated by the identity mapping module) from the message bus and publishes it to the IoT bub.
5. The logger module logs all messages from the message bus into a disk file.

The following block diagram illustrates the device command data flow pipeline:

![](media/iot-hub-gateway-sdk-physical-device/gateway_ble_command_data_flow.png)

1. The IoT Hub HTTP module periodically polls the IoT hub for new command messages.
2. When the IoT Hub HTTP module receives a new command message, it publishes it to the message bus.
3. The identity mapping module picks up the command message from the message bus and uses an internal table to translate the IoT Hub device ID to a device MAC address. It then publishes a new message to the message bus that includes the MAC address of the target device in the properties map of the message.
4. The BLE module picks up this message and executes the I/O instruction by communicating with the BLE device.
5. The logger module logs all messages from the message bus into a disk file.

## Building the sample

At the time of writing, the Gateway SDK only supports gateways that contain BLE modules on Linux. The
sample gets built when you build the SDK by running `tools/build.sh`.  The
[devbox setup](devbox_setup.md) guide has information on how you can build the
SDK.

Preparing your BLE device
-------------------------

This sample has been tested with the [Texas Instruments SensorTag](http://www.ti.com/ww/en/wireless_connectivity/sensortag2015/index.html)
device on an Intel Edison board. Before running the sample you'll want to
prepare the device by following the instructions in the article that talks about
[connecting a BLE device on the Intel Edison](./connecting_to_ble_device_on_intel_edison.md).
Though the article talks about Intel Edison in particular it should be possible
to adapt the instructions to any arbitrary device that supports BLE and
runs Linux.

Running the sample
------------------

In order to bootstrap and run the sample, you'll need to configure each module
that participates in the gateway. This configuration is provided as JSON. All
5 participating modules will need to be configured. There is a sample JSON file
provided in the repo called `gateway_sample.json` which you can use as a
starting point for building your own configuration file. You should find the
file at the path `samples/ble_gateway_hl/src` relative to the root of the repo.

In order to run the sample you'll run the `ble_gateway_hl` binary passing the
path to the configuration JSON file.

```
ble_gateway_hl <<path to the configuration JSON>>
```

Template configuration JSONs are given below for all the modules that are a part
of this sample. The sample configuration for the BLE device assumes a Texas
Instruments SensorTag device. But any standard BLE device that can operate as a
GATT peripheral should work. You'll only need to update the GATT characterstic
IDs and data (for write instructions). 

### Logger configuration

```json
{
    "module name": "logger",
    "module path": "<</path/to/liblogger_hl.so>>",

      },
      {
        "type": "write_at_exit",
        "characteristic_uuid": "F000AA02-0451-4000-B000-000000000000",
        "data": "AA=="
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

      "deviceId": "<<Azure IoT Hub Device ID>>",
      "deviceKey": "<<Azure IoT Hub Device Key>>"
    }
  ]
}
```

### BLE Printer module configuration

```json
{
    "module name": "BLE Printer",
    "module path": "<</path/to/libble_printer.so",
    "args": null
}
```

Sending cloud-to-device messages
--------------------------------

The BLE module also supports sending of instructions from the Azure IoT Hub to
the device. You should be able to use the
[Azure IoT Hub Device Explorer](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks/blob/master/tools/DeviceExplorer/doc/how_to_use_device_explorer.md) or the [IoT Hub Explorer](https://github.com/Azure/azure-iot-sdks/tree/master/tools/iothub-explorer)
to craft and send JSON messages that are handled and passed on to the BLE device
by the BLE module. For example, if you were using a Texas Instruments SensorTag
device then you'd send the following sequence of JSON messages to the device
via IoT Hub to cause the red LED on the SensorTag to light up:

  - Reset all LEDs and the buzzer (turn them off)

    ```json
    {
      "type": "write_once",
      "characteristic_uuid": "F000AA65-0451-4000-B000-000000000000",
      "data": "AA=="
    }
    ```

  - Configure I/O as 'remote'

    ```json
    {
      "type": "write_once",
      "characteristic_uuid": "F000AA66-0451-4000-B000-000000000000",
      "data": "AQ=="
    }
    ```

  - Turn on red LED

    ```json
    {
      "type": "write_once",
      "characteristic_uuid": "F000AA65-0451-4000-B000-000000000000",
      "data": "AQ=="
    }
    ```
