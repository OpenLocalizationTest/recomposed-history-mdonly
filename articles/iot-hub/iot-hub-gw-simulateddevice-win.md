# IoT Gateway SDK â€“ send device-to-cloud messages with a simulated device using Windows

[AZURE.INCLUDE [iot-hub-gw-simulated-selector](../../includes/iot-hub-gw-simulated-selector.md)]

## Build and run the sample

Before you get started, you must:

- [Set up your C development environment][lnk-setupdevbox] for working with the SDK on Windows.
- [Create an IoT hub][lnk-create-hub] in your Azure subscription, you will need the name of your hub to complete this walkthrough. If you don't already have an Azure subscription, you can get a [free account][lnk-free-trial].
- Add two devices to your IoT hub and make a note of their ids and device keys. You can use the [Device Explorer or iothub-explorer][lnk-explorer-tools] tool to add your devices to the IoT hub you created in the previous step and retrieve their keys.

To build the sample:

1. Open a **Developer Command Prompt for VS2015** command prompt.
2. Navigate to the **azure-iot-gateway-sdk\build\** folder in your local copy of the repository.
3. Run the **build.cmd** script.

To run the sample:

In a text editor, open the file **azure-iot-gateway-sdk\samples\simple_device_cloud_upload\src\simple_device_cloud_upload_win.json** in your local copy of the repository. This file configures the modules in the sample gateway:

- The **IoTHub** module which connects to your IoT hub. Make sure that the **IoTHubName** value is set to the name of your IoT hub. The value of **IoTHubSuffix** should be **azure-devices.net**.
- The **mapping** module which maps the MAC addresses of your simulated devices to you IoT Hub device ids. Make sure that **deviceId** values match the ids of the two devices you added to your IoT hub, and that the **deviceKey** values contain the keys of your two devices.
- The **BLE1** and **BLE2** modules are the simulated devices. Note how their MAC addresses match those in the **mapping** module.
- The **Logger** module logs your gateway activity to a file.

            {
                "macAddress" : "01-01-01-01-01-01"
            }
        },
        {
            "module name":"BLE2",
            "module path" : "modules\\ble_fake\\Debug\\ble_fake_hl.dll",
            "args":
            {
                "macAddress" : "02-02-02-02-02-02"
            }
        },
        {
            "module name":"Logger",
            "module path" : "modules\\logger\\Debug\\logger_hl.dll",
            "args":
            {
                "filename":"deviceCloudUploadGatewaylog.log"
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

Save any changes you made to the configuration file.

To run the sample:

1. In your **Developer Command Prompt for VS2015** command prompt, navigate to the **azure-iot-gateway-sdk\.cmake\samples\simple_device_cloud_upload** folder in your local copy of the repository.
2. Run the following command:

    ```
    Debug\simple_device_cloud_upload.exe ..\samples\simple_device_cloud_upload\src\simple_device_cloud_upload_win.json
    ```

3. You can use the [Device Explorer or iothub-explorer][lnk-explorer-tools] tool monitor the messages that IoT hub receives from the gateway.
