# 4.2 Complimentary reading: Change the on and off behavior of the LED

## 4.2.1 What will you do

Customize the messages to change the LED’s on and off behavior.

## 4.2.2 What will you learn

Use additional Node.js functions to change the LED’s on and off behavior.

## 4.2.3 Add Node.js functions

1. Open the sample application in Visual Studio code by running the following commands:

    ```bash
    cd Lesson4
    code .
    ```

2. Open the app.js file, and then add the following functions at the end:

    ```javascript
    function turnOnLED() {
      wpi.digitalWrite(CONFIG_PIN, 1);
    }

    function turnOffLED() {
      wpi.digitalWrite(CONFIG_PIN, 0);
    }
    ```

3. Add the following conditions in the switch-case block of the receiveMessageAndBlink function:

    ```javascript
    case ‘on’:
      turnOnLED();
      break;
    case ‘off’
      turnOffLED();
      break;
    ```

    Now you’ve configured the sample application to respond to more instructions through messages. The “on” instruction turns on the LED and the “off” instruction turns off the LED.

4. Open the gulpfile.js file, and then add the following code between line 39 and line 40:

    ```javascript
    var buildCustomMessage = function (messageId) {
      if (messageId & 1 && messageId < MAX_MESSAGE_COUNT) {
        return new Message(JSON.stringify({ command: 'on', messageId: messageId }));
      } else if (messageId < MAX_MESSAGE_COUNT) {
        return new Message(JSON.stringify({ command: 'off', messageId: messageId }));
      } else {
        return new Message(JSON.stringify({ command: 'stop', messageId: messageId }));
      }
    }
    ```

5. In the `sendMessage` function, replace the line `var message = buildMessage(sentMessageCount);` with the new line below.

    ```javascript
    var message = buildCustomMessage(sentMessageCount);
    ``` 



6. Save all the changes.

### 4.2.4 Deploy and run the sample application
Deploy and run the sample application on your Pi by running the following command:

```bash
gulp
```

### 4.2.5 Deploy and run the sample application

You should see the LED turned on for two seconds, and then turned off for another two seconds. The last “stop” message stops the sample application from running.

You rock! You’ve successfully customized the messages that are sent to the sample application from your IoT hub.

### 4.2.6 Summary

This complimentary reading demos how to customize the messages so that the sample application can control the on and off behavior of the LED in a different way.

In the next lesson, you will learn how to gather data from real sensors and use Azure Machine Learning to do further analysis of the data. (Coming Soon...)
