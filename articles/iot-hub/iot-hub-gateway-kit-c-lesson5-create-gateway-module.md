1. Initialize the configuration files by running the following commands:

   ```bash
   cd iot-hub-c-intel-nuc-gateway-getting-started
   cd Lesson5
   npm install
   gulp init
   ```

1. Update the gateway configuration file with the MAC address of Intel NUC. Skip this step if you have gone through the lesson to [configure and run a BLE sample application][config_ble].

   1. Open the gateway configuration file by running the following command:

      ```bash
      # For Windows command prompt
      code %USERPROFILE%\.iot-hub-getting-started\config-gateway.json

      # For MacOS or Ubuntu
      code ~/.iot-hub-getting-started/config-gateway.json
      ```

   1. Update the gateway's MAC address when you [set up Intel NUC as a IoT gateway][setup_nuc], and then save the file.

1. Compile the sample source code by running the following command:

   ```bash
   gulp compile
   ```

   The command transfers the sample source code to Intel NUC and runs `build.sh` to compile it.

1. Run the `hello_world` app on Intel NUC by running the following command:

   ```bash
   gulp run
   ```

   The command runs `../Tools/run-hello-world.js` that is specified in `config.json` to start the sample app on Intel NUC.
