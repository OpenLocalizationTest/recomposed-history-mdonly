# Devices supported by the Azure IoT device SDKs

This article provides a list of the device, operating system, and language combinations that are supported by the Azure IoT device SDKs. The IoT device SDKs help you to connect to an IoT hub, send device-to-cloud telemetry data, and receive cloud-to-device commands.

## List of supported devices

The following table lists the IoT device SDK languages that support each combination of device and operating system.

| Device           | Operating System     | IoT device SDK language         |
| :-------------   | :-------------       | :-------------                  |
| BeagleBone Black | Debian Linux         | C                               |
| BeagleBone Black | Snappy Ubuntu Core   | C                               |
| PC               | Ubuntu Linux         | C                               |
| PC               | Fedora Linux         | C                               |
| PC               | Windows              | C, .NET                         |
| mbed Enabled Freescale K64F | RTOS      | C                               |
| Raspberry Pi     | Raspbian             | C                               |
| Raspberry Pi     | Windows 10 IoT Core  | C                               |

[_TBD_ update this table with details of .NET, Java, and node support.]
