# Azure IoT Gateway SDK - Get started using Windows
[!INCLUDE [iot-hub-gateway-sdk-getstarted-selector](../../includes/iot-hub-gateway-sdk-getstarted-selector.md)]

## How to build the sample
Before you get started, you must [set up your development environment][lnk-setupdevbox] for working with the SDK on Windows.

1. Open a **Developer Command Prompt for VS2015** command prompt.
2. Navigate to the root folder in your local copy of the **azure-iot-gateway-sdk** repository.
3. Run the **tools\\build.cmd** script. This script creates a Visual Studio solution file, builds the solution, and runs the tests. You can find the Visual Studio solution in the **build** folder in your local copy of the **azure-iot-gateway-sdk** repository.

## How to run the sample
1. The **build.cmd** script creates a folder called **build** in your local copy of the repository. This folder contains the two modules used in this sample.
   
    The build script places **logger.dll** in the **build\\modules\\logger\\Debug** folder and **hello_world.dll** in the **build\\modules\\hello_world\\Debug** folder. Use these paths for the **module path** value as shown in the JSON settings file below.
2. The hello_world_sample process takes the path to a JSON configuration file as an argument in the command line. An example JSON file has been provided as part of the repo at **azure-iot-gateway-sdk\samples\hello_world\src\hello_world_win.json** and is copied below. It will work as is unless you have modified the build script to place modules or sample executables in non-default locations. 

   > [!NOTE]
   > The module paths are relative to the directory where the hello_world_sample.exe is located. The sample JSON configuration file defaults to writing 'log.txt' in your current working directory.
   
    ```
    {
      "modules": [
        {
          "module name": "logger",
          "loading args": {
            "module path": "..\\..\\..\\modules\\logger\\Debug\\logger.dll"
          },
          "args": { "filename": "log.txt" }
        },
        {
          "module name": "hello_world",
          "loading args": {
            "module path": "..\\..\\..\\modules\\hello_world\\Debug\\hello_world.dll"
          },
            "args": null
          }
      ],
      "links": [
        {
          "source": "hello_world",
          "sink": "logger"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```
3. Navigate to the root folder of your local copy of the **azure-iot-gateway-sdk** repository.

4. Run the following command:
   
   ```
   build\samples\hello_world\Debug\hello_world_sample.exe samples\hello_world\src\hello_world_win.json
   ```
