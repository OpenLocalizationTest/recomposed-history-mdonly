# IoT Gateway SDK - Getting Started using Windows

[AZURE.INCLUDE [iot-hub-gateway-sdk-getstarted-selector](../../includes/iot-hub-gateway-sdk-getstarted-selector.md)]

## How to build the sample

Before you get started, you must [set up your development environment][lnk-setupdevbox] for working with the SDK on Windows.

1. Open a **Developer Command Prompt for VS2015** command prompt.
2. Navigate to the folder **azure-iot-gateway-sdk\build\** in your local copy of the repository.
3. Run the **build.cmd** script. This script creates a Visual Studio solution file, compiles the solution, and runs the tests. You can find the Visual Studio solution in the **azure-iot-gateway-sdk\.cmake** folder in your local copy of the repository.

## How to run the sample

1. The **build.cmd** script creates a folder called **.cmake** in your local copy of the repository. This includes the two modules used in this sample.

    The build script places **logger_hl.dll** in the **modules\logger\** folder and **helloworld_hl.dl** in the **modules\helloworld** folder. Use these paths for the **module path** value as shown in the JSON settings file below.

2. For the **logger_hl** module, in **args** set the **filename** value to the path of the file that will contain the log data.

    This is an example of a JSON settings file for Windows that will write to the **log.txt** file in your current working directory. The Hello World sample already has a JSON settings file and you do not need to change it. Use this example as guidance if you want to change the output location for the log file.

    ```
    {
      "modules" :
      [
        {
          "module name" : "logger_hl",
          "module path" : "..\\..\\..\\modules\\logger\\Debug\\logger_hl.dll",
          "args" : 
          {
            "filename":"log.txt"
          }
        },
        {
          "module name" : "helloworld",
          "module path" : "..\\..\\..\\modules\\helloworld\\Debug\\helloworld_hl.dll",
          "args" : 
          {
            "notused":"at_all"
          }
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

3. At the command prompt, navigate to the **.cmake\samples\helloworld\Debug\** folder.
4. Run the **helloworld_sample.exe** executable.
