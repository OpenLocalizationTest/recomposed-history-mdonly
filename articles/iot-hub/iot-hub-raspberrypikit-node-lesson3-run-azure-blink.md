# 3.2 Run the Azure blink sample application on your Raspberry Pi 3
## 3.2.1 What you will do
Deploy and run a sample application to your Raspberry Pi 3 device that sends messages to IoT hub.

## 3.2.2 What you will learn
- How to use gulp to deploy and run the sample Node.js application with your Raspberry Pi 3

## 3.2.3 What you need
- You must have successfully completed the previous section, Create an Azure function app and a storage account to process and store IoT hub messages, in this lesson.

## 3.2.4 Get your IoT hub and device connection strings
You can get your IoT hub connection string from Azure-cli. Run the following command to show the IoT hub connection string. The `{my hub name}` is the one you specified in Lesson 2. And the default value of `{resource group name}` should be `iot-sample` 

```bash
az iot hub show-connection-string --name {my hub name} --resource-group {resource group name}
```

You also need to get the device connection string to connect the Pi to your IoT hub. Run the following command to show the device connection string. The parameters `{my hub name}` and `{resource group name}` are the same as the ones above. The default value of `{device id}` should be `myraspberrypi` 

```bash
az iot device show-connection-string --hub {my hub name} --device-id {device id} --resource-group {resource group name}
```

## 3.2.5 Configure the device connection

Initialize the configuration file with the following commands.

```bash
npm install
gulp init
```

Update your device configuration file `config.json` using VS Code so you can deploy the sample application from your computer:

```bash
// For Windows command prompt
code %USERPROFILE%\.iot-hub-getting-started\config-raspberrypi.json

// For MacOS or Ubuntu
code ~/.iot-hub-getting-started/config-raspberrypi.json
```


![config.json](media/iot-hub-raspberry-pi-lessons/lesson3/config.png)

1. Replace **[device hostname or IP address]** with the device IP address or hostname you got from `device-discovery-cli` or inherited from you've configured in Lesson1. 
2. Replace **[IoT device connection string]** with the `device connection string` you obtained.
3. Replace **[IoT hub connection string]** with the `iot hub connection string` you obtained. 

## 3.2.6 Deploy and run the sample app
Use the following command to deploy the sample application to your Pi and run it:

```bash
npm install
gulp
```

> [AZURE.NOTE] The default gulp task runs `install-tools`, `deploy`, and `run` tasks sequentially. In [Lesson 1](iot-hub-raspberrypikit-node-lesson1-deploy-blink-app.md), you ran these tasks one after another manually.

## 3.2.7 Verify the app works
You should now see the LED on your Pi flashing every two seconds. Every time the LED flashes, it sends a message to your IoT hub and verifies that the message has been sent to IoT hub. In addition, every time a message is received by the IoT hub, it will be printed in the console window. This application terminates automatically after sending 20 messages.

## 3.2.8 Summary
You have now deployed the Azure blink sample application on your Raspberry Pi 3 and ran it to send device-to-cloud messages to your IoT hub. You can move to the next section to monitor your messages as they are written to the storage account.
