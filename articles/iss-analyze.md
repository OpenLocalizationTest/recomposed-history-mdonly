#Analyze your ISS data with Power Query
For analyzing data from your Azure Intelligent Systems Service (ISS) account, we recommend Microsoft Power Query for Excel, part of the PowerBI for Office 365 suite. In this section, we’ll point to resources that can help you better use Power Query with your machine-generated data.   

For more information about Power Query, see [Microsoft Power Query for Excel Help](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=401291).

##Import your data
With Power Query, you can import data from a wide variety of sources, including text files, OData feeds, database files, Azure blob storage, Azure table storage, and web services. For information on how to connect Power Query to the ISS OData feeds, see [Retrieve your data from the OData feeds](./iss-retrieve-odata-feed.md).   

##Shape your data
You can use the **Query Editor** to transform and shape your data before you import it into your worksheet. For details on shaping your data, see [Shape your data](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=401164). On that page you will find instructions for the following tasks:   

-	Combine data from multiple data sources
-	Filter your data
-	Sort your data
-	Aggregate or group rows in your data
-	Insert a custom column
-	Remove columns
-	Merge columns
-	Remove duplicates   

After you are satisfied with your query, click **Load to worksheet** to load your query results to your worksheet.   

For information on creating more advanced queries, see [Create an advanced query](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=401165).   

##Model and visualize your data 
In addition to Power Query, Power BI contains tools to help you model your data and visualize your data. For more information about these tools, see the following resources:  

•	[Power Pivot: Powerful data analysis and data modeling in Excel](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=401166)
•	[Get started with Power Map](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=401168)
•	[Power View: Explore, visualize, and present your data](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=401167)
