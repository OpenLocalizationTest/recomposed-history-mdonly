# Create a Fully Qualified Domain Name in Azure Portal

When you create a virtual machine in the [Azure Preview Portal](https://portal.azure.com), it also creates a public IP resource. You can use this IP address to remotely access the virtual machine. However, the portal does not create a Fully Qualified Domain Name (or FQDN) by default. This article demonstrates how you can add a domain name to your virtual machine.

The article assumes that you have logged in to your subscription in the portal, and created a virtual machine with the available images, using the **Resource Manager** deployment model. Follow these steps once your virtual machine starts running.

1.  View the virtual machine settings on the portal and click on the Public IP address.

2.  **Dissociate** the Public IP from the virtual machine. Note that it does not yet show a domain name. After you click on the **Yes** button, it might take a few seconds before it completes the dissociation.

3.  Once the **Dissociate** button grays out, click the **All settings** section of the Public IP and open the **Configuration** tab. Enter the desired DNS name label. **Save** this configuration.

4.  Go back to the virtual machine blade in the portal and click the **All settings** for the virtual machine. Open the **Network interfaces** tab and click on the Network interface resource associated with this virtual machine. This will open the **Network interface** blade in the portal.

5.  Note that the **Public IP address** field for the Network interface is blank. Click the **All settings** section for this Network interface and open the **IP addresses** tab. On the **IP addresses** blade, click **Enabled** for the **Public IP address** field. Select the **IP address Configure required settings** tab and select the default IP that you had dissociated earlier. Click **Save**. It might take a few moments to add back the IP resource.

6.  Close all other blades and go back to the **Virtual Machine** blade. Click on the Public IP resource in the settings. Notice that the Public IP blade now shows the desired FQDN as the **DNS name**.

    You can now connect remotely to the virtual machine using this DNS name, for example, `SSH adminuser@testdnslabel.eastus.cloudapp.azure.com`.
