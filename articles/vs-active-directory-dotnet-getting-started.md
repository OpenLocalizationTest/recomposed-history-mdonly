######Code files were added to your project 

An authentication startup class, App\_Start/Startup.Auth.cs was added to your project containing startup logic for Azure AD authentication. Also, a controller class, Controllers/AccountController.cs was added which contains SignIn() and SignOut() methods. Finally, a partial view, Views/Shared/_LoginPartial.cshtml was added containing an action link for SignIn/SignOut. 

######Startup code was added to your project
 
If you already had a Startup class in your project, the Configuration() method was updated to include a call to ConfigureAuth(app) was added to that method. Otherwise, a Startup class was added to your project. 

######Your app.config or web.config has new configuration values 

The following configuration entries have been added. 
	<pre>
	`<appSettings>
	    <add key="ida:ClientId" value="ClientId from the new Azure AD App" /> 
	    <add key="ida:Tenant" value="Your selected Azure AD Tenant" /> 
	    <add key="ida:AADInstance" value="https://login.windows.net/{0}" /> 
	    <add key="Ida:PostLogoutRedirectURI" value="Your project start page" /> 
	</appSettings>` </pre>

######An Azure Active Directory (AD) App was created 
An Azure AD Application was created in the directory that you selected in the wizard. 

##Getting Started with Azure Active Directory (AD)

Here is what you can do with the code that was added.
 
######Requiring authentication to access controllers 

All controllers in your project were adorned with the [Authorize] attribute. This attribute will require the user to be authenticated before accessing these controllers. To allow the controller to be accessed anonymously, remove this attribute from the controller.
 
######Adding SignIn / SignOut Controls 

To add a the SignIn/SignOut controls to your view, you can use the _LoginPartial.cshtml partial view to add the functionality to one of your views. Here is an example of the functionality added to the standard _Layout.cshtml view:
	<pre> 
	`<!DOCTYPE html> 
	<html> 
	<head> 
	    <meta charset="utf-8" /> 
	    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> 
	    <title>@ViewBag.Title - My ASP.NET Application</title> 
	    @Styles.Render("~/Content/css") 
	    @Scripts.Render("~/bundles/modernizr") 
	</head> 
	<body> 
	    <div class="navbar navbar-inverse navbar-fixed-top"> 
	        <div class="container"> 
	            <div class="navbar-header"> 
	                <button type="button" class="navbar-toggle" data-toggle="collapse" data-target=".navbar-collapse"> 
	                    <span class="icon-bar"></span> 
	                    <span class="icon-bar"></span> 
	                    <span class="icon-bar"></span> 
	                </button> 
	                @Html.ActionLink("Application name", "Index", "Home", new { area = "" }, new { @class = "navbar-brand" }) 
	            </div> 
	            <div class="navbar-collapse collapse"> 
	                <ul class="nav navbar-nav"> 
	                    <li>@Html.ActionLink("Home", "Index", "Home")</li> 
	                    <li>@Html.ActionLink("About", "About", "Home")</li> 
	                    <li>@Html.ActionLink("Contact", "Contact", "Home")</li> 
	                </ul> 
	                @Html.Partial("_LoginPartial") 
	            </div> 
	        </div> 
	    </div>

	        </footer> 
	    </div> 
	    @Scripts.Render("~/bundles/jquery") 
	    @Scripts.Render("~/bundles/bootstrap")
