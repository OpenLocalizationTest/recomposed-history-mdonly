# Help I forgot my password

Step 1... don't panic

If the following scenarios apply to you, we can help

* You are unsure how to access your account and can't remember your password
* A password was not assigned and your administrator sent you here

## Unlock your account

If you are here to unlock your account, follow the steps below. 
When you see **Chose a new password** at step 6 below, you are able to unlock or change your password and be unlocked.

## Reset my password

To get back into your account, follow these steps below.

1. From any work or school sign-in page, click the **Can't access your account? link** then **Work or school account** or go directly to the [password reset page](https://passwordreset.microsoftonline.com/)

    ![Can't access your account?][Login]

2. Enter your work or school **User ID** and prove you aren't a robot by passing the CAPTCHA challenge and entering the text presented to you and click **Next**
3. Depending on how your administrator has configured things you will see one or more of the following
    * **Email my alternate email** - Sends an email with a 6-digit code to either your alternate email or your authentication email (you choose).
    * **Text my mobile phone** - Texts your phone with a 6-digit code to either your mobile phone or your authentication phone (you choose).
    * **Call my mobile phone** - Calls either your mobile phone or your authentication phone (you choose). Press the # key to verify the call.
    * **Call my office phone** - Calls your office phone. Press the # key to verify the call.
    * **Answer my security questions** - Displays your preregistered security questions for you to answer.
4. Populate the required fields with answers to the challenge information and click **Next**

    ![Verify your authentication data][Verification]

5. Your administrator may require an additional verification step and you may have to repeat step 4 again with a different option
6. On the **Choose a new password** page, enter a new password that meets your organizations requirements, confirm your password and then click **Finish**

    ![Change your password][Change]

7. When you see **Your password has been reset**, you can sign in with your new password.

    ![Your password has been reset][Complete]

> [NOTE!]
> If your administrator has not enabled this functionality, you are presented with a "contact your administrator" link so that your administrator can provide assistance via email or a web portal of their own.
>

After using this method to unlock or reset your password, you may receive an email confirming this process has been completed that comes from an account like "Microsoft on behalf of Your Organization Here". If you get an email like this, and did not use self-service password reset to regain access to your account contact your administrator.
