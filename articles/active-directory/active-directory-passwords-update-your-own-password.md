   * **Text my mobile phone**: Texts your phone with a 6-digit code to either your **mobile phone** or your **authentication email** (you choose).

7. Enter the 6-digit code you received, and click **Next**.

8. Your administrator might require an additional verification step. If so, repeat step 4 with a different option selected.
