# How to update your own password
If you are unsure how to manage your work or school account password, you've come to the right place! Read below to learn how to perform common steps, like changing a password, resetting a password, or registering for password reset.

* [**Don’t lose access to your account!**](#dont-lose-access-to-your-account)
* [**How to change your password from Office 365**](#how-to-change-your-password-from-o365)
* [**How to change your password from the access panel**](#how-to-change-your-password-from-the-access-panel)
* [**How to reset your password**](#how-to-reset-your-password)
* [**How to unlock your account**](#how-to-unlock-your-account)
* [**Common problems and their solutions**](#common-problems-and-their-solutions)

## Don’t lose access to your account!
> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Why am I seeing this?** If you followed a link to get here, you're probably seeing this because your administrator requires you to register for password reset to gain access to your app. You might be asked for phone or email information, or to set up security questions.  Don’t worry – we only use this information to keep your account more secure. The steps presented here should help you to reach your goal.

The fastest way to register for password reset is to go to [http://aka.ms/ssprsetup](http://aka.ms/ssprsetup).  

1. Navigate to [http://aka.ms/ssprsetup](http://aka.ms/ssprsetup).
2. Enter your username and password.
3. Choose an option to register for by clicking **set it up now**. In this case, I demonstrate registering my **authentication phone**. Your administrator may require you to register for more than one option. 

   ![][101]
4. Select your country code from the dropdown and enter your **full phone number including area code** and choose **text me** or **call me** either option provides you a code. In this example I chose text me.

   ![][102]
5. Once the code arrives, enter it into the input box, and then click "verify." 

   ![][103]
6. When you see **finish**, that's it! Now you can use what you registered for to reset your password at any time by going to [https://passwordreset.microsoftonline.com](https://passwordreset.microsoftonline.com).

   ![][104]

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > If your admin lets you register for more than one option, we highly recommend you also register a back-up option in case you lose your phone or access to your email.

## How to reset your password
Follow the steps below to reset your work or school account password from any work or school account sign in screen.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This feature is only available to you if your admin has turned it on. If it's not turned on, you will see a message indicating your account is not enabled for this feature.  You can use the "contact your administrator" link in this case to get in touch with your admin to unlock your account.
>
> If your admin has enabled you for this feature, you are required to sign up before you can use it. You can do that here: http://aka.ms/ssprsetup.
>
>

1. On any work or school account sign-in page, click the "can't access your account?" link, or navigate to https://passwordreset.microsoftonline.com directly.

   ![][110]
2. On the "who are you?" page, enter your work or school account ID and prove you aren't a robot by passing the CAPTCHA challenge.

   ![][111]
3. Click the "next" button.
4. Choose an option to reset your password. Depending on how your admin has configured the system, you might see one or more of the following choices:

   * **Email my alternate email** - sends an email with a 6-digit code to either your **alternate email** or **authentication email** (you choose).
   * **Text my mobile phone** - texts your phone with a 6-digit code to either your **mobile phone** or **authentication email** (you choose).
   * **Call my mobile phone** - calls your **mobile phone** or **authentication phone** (you choose) - press the *#* key to verify the call.
   * **Call my office phone** - calls your **office phone** - press the *#* key to verify the call.
   * **Answer my security questions** - displays your pre-registered security questions for you to answer.

   ![][109]
5. We'll use the "text my mobile phone" option as an example. If you are using a phone-based option, you need to verify your phone number before we send a text. Enter your full phone number and then click **Text** to verify it's correct and send a text.

6. When you receive the text, make sure you use the verification code in the message body, not the number the code was sent from. It might take several minutes to get the text.

7. Now, enter the code you just received on your phone into the input box on the page and choose **Next**.

8. Your administrator may require an additional verification step, in which case repeat step 4 with a different option selected.
9. On the "choose a new password" screen, select a new password and confirm your choice, then click **Finish**.

   ![][107]

10. Once your password is accepted, you can sign in with the new password.

## How to unlock your account
Follow the steps below to unlock your local account from any work or school account sign in screen. **Note: You are only able to unlock your account if it has been locked on-premises.**

>
> If your admin has enabled you for this feature, you'll first need to sign up before you can use it. You can do that here: http://aka.ms/ssprsetup.

   * **Call my office phone** - calls your **office phone** - press the *#* key to verify the call.
   * **Answer my security questions** - displays your pre-registered security questions for you to answer.

   ![][112]

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Make sure you update all your devices to your newest password, as often times a rogue app with an old password (like your phone email client) can be the culprit behind why your account got locked out in the first place.
