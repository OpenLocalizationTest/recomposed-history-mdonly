# Group Policy and MDM Settings

We recommend that these Group Policy and MDM settings should be used only on corporate-owned devices, because these policies are applied to the userâ€™s entire device. Applying an MDM policy to disable settings sync for a personal, user-owned device will negatively impact the use of that device. Additionally, other user accounts on the device will also be affected by the policy. 

Enterprises that want to manage roaming for personal (unmanaged) devices can use the Azure portal to enable or disable roaming, rather than using Group Policy or MDM. 
The following tables describe the policy settings available.
MDM settings
The MDM policy settings apply to both Windows 10 and Windows 10 Mobile.

| Name                               | Description                                                          |
|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Allow Microsoft Account Connection | Allows users to authenticate using a Microsoft account on the device |
| Allow Sync My Settings             | Allows users to roam Windows settings and app data                   |
 
## Group Policy settings
The Group Policy settings apply to Windows 10 devices that are joined to an Active Directory domain. The table includes legacy settings that would appear to manage sync settings, but that do not work for Enterprise Sync for Windows 10.
