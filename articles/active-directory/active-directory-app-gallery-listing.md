# Listing your application in the Azure Active Directory application gallery

To list an application that supports single sign-on with Azure Active Directory in the [Azure AD gallery](http://azure.microsoft.com/marketplace/active-directory/all/) and in the Azure Marketplace, the Azure AD team will need to verify your integration. This requires that you send the following information to <waadpartners@microsoft.com>:

- Provide a brief description of how your customers create the connection between your application and Azure AD. This could be:
  - Built into the application using the [Azure AD consent framework](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/b08d91fa-6a64-4deb-92f4-f5857add9ed8#BKMK_Consent)
  - By configuring Azure AD as an identity provider (SAML 2.0, WS-Federation, or OpenID Connect) using an you applicationâ€™s administrative portal
  - By contacting someone in your organization to manually create the connection
- Provide access to an instance of your application that is or can be configured to connect to Azure Active Directory, including any user accounts required and instructions on how this test the integration
