# Listing your application in the Azure Active Directory application gallery
To list an application that supports single sign-on with Azure Active Directory in the [Azure AD gallery](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/category/azure-active-directory-apps?page=1), the application must first be registered with Azure Active Directory and implement single sign-on using one of the methods described in this article:

[How to sign in any Azure Active Directory (AD) user using the multi-tenant application pattern](active-directory-devhowto-multi-tenant-overview.md)

Single sign on may be implemented using any of the supported federation protocols, including OAuth2, OpenID Connect, SAML, or WS-Federation. The app must also support [user consent](active-directory-integrating-applications.md#overview-of-the-consent-framework) as the means to connect the app to other instances of Azure AD.

Once you app is ready to be used and tested by users with their own instances of Azure Active Directory, please complete the questions below and send to waadpartners@microsoft.com.

* Provide credentials for a test tenant or account with your application that can be used by the Azure AD team to test the integration.  
* Provide instructions on how the Azure AD team can sign in and connect an instance of Azure AD to your application using the [Azure AD consent framework](active-directory-integrating-applications.md#overview-of-the-consent-framework). 

* Provide any further instructions required for the Azure AD team to test single sign-on with your application.
