# Using Azure AD Connect Health with AD DS
The following documentation is specific to monitoring Active Directory Domain Services with Azure AD Connect Health. For information on monitoring AD FS with Azure AD Connect Health see [Using Azure AD Connect Health with AD FS](active-directory-aadconnect-health-adfs.md). Additionally, for information on monitoring Azure AD Connect (Sync) with Azure AD Connect Health see [Using Azure AD Connect Health for Sync](active-directory-aadconnect-health-sync.md).

## Alerts for Azure AD Connect Health for AD DS
The Alerts section within Azure AD Connect Health for AD DS, provides you a list of active and resolved alerts, related to your Domain Controllers. Selecting an active or resolved alert will open a new blade with additional information, along with resolution steps, and links to supporting documentation. 

Enabling email notifications for alerts is available within this blade, as well as changing the time range in view. Expanding the time range will allow you to see prior resolved alerts.

## Domain Controllers
This feature provides a view of your environment while grouping domain controllers by domain or site, and including key operational metrics. This provides a quick and easy way to understand not only the layout of your environment (great if you have a large set of domain controllers) but also a way to understand the health status and identify any domain controllers that may require further investigation.

By default, only a preselected number of columns are displayed by default; however, to see more operations on the connector or to view operations from other connectors, click on the columns command and choose the specific metrics you are interested in.

## Replication Status
This feature enables you to keep an eye on the state of replication. Not only does it allow you to see where replication is happening from, but it also includes helpful links to documentation, when an error is found.

## Monitoring
This feature provides a graphical trend of different performance counters that are being collected from each of the monitored domain controllers. Today, trying to see this information across multiple domain controllers is difficult. The chart gives you, not only a simpler way of monitoring the performance of your domain controllers, but also a single visual across your entire environment.

By default, the Used Processor metric is displayed. To see other performance metrics, click on the edit chart command and choose the specific performance counter and desired time range.
