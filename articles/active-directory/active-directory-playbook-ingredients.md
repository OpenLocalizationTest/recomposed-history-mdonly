# Azure Active Directory Proof of Concept Playbook Ingredients 

## Theme
Azure AD provides identity and access solutions across multiple areas in the enterprise. We classify the scenarios in the following areas: 

* Lots of apps, one identity 
* Increase your security 
* Scale with Self Service 

Defining a theme to frame the PoC helps to focus the efforts that resonates with business goals, which oftentimes are the triggers of the interest in a proof of concept in the first place.
