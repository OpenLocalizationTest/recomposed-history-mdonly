# User sign-in with Azure Active Directory Pass-through Authentication

## What is Azure Active Directory Pass-through Authentication?

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Pass-through Authentication allows your users to sign in to both on-premises and cloud-based applications using the same passwords. This feature provides your users a better experience - one less password to remember, and reduces IT helpdesk costs because your users are less likely to forget how to sign in. When users sign in using Azure AD, this feature validates users' passwords directly against your on-premises Active Directory.

This feature is an alternative to [Azure AD Password Hash Synchronization](active-directory-aadconnectsync-implement-password-synchronization.md), which provides the same benefit to organizations. However, security and compliance policies in certain organizations don't permit these organizations to send users' passwords, even in a hashed form, outside their internal boundaries. Pass-through Authentication is the right solution for such organizations.

You can combine Pass-through Authentication with the [Seamless Single Sign-on](active-directory-aadconnect-sso.md) feature. This way, when your users are accessing applications on their corporate machines inside your corporate network, they don't need to type in their passwords to sign in.

## Key benefits of using Azure AD Pass-through Authentication

- Great user experience
  - Users use the same passwords to sign into both on-premises and cloud-based applications.
  - Users spend less time talking to the IT helpdesk resolving password-related issues.
- Easy to deploy & administer
  - No need for complex on-premises deployments or network configuration.
  - Needs just a lightweight agent to be installed on-premises.
  - No management overhead. The agent automatically receives improvements and bug fixes.
- Secure
  - On-premises passwords are never stored in the cloud in any form.
  - The agent only makes outbound connections from within your network. Therefore, there is no requirement to install the agent in a perimeter network, also known as a DMZ.
  - Works seamlessly with Azure Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
- Highly available
  - Additional agents can be installed on multiple on-premises servers to provide high availability of sign-in requests.

## Feature highlights

- Supports user sign-in into all web browser-based applications and into Microsoft Office client applications that use [modern authentication](https://aka.ms/modernauthga).
- Sign-in usernames can be either the on-premises default username (`userPrincipalName`) or another attribute configured in Azure AD Connect (known as `Alternate ID`).
- The feature works seamlessly with [conditional access](../active-directory-conditional-access.md) features such as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to help secure your users.
- Multi-forest environments are supported if there are forest trusts between your AD forests and if name suffix routing is correctly configured.
- It is a free feature, and you don't need any paid editions of Azure AD to use it.
- It can be enabled via [Azure AD Connect](active-directory-aadconnect.md).
- It uses a lightweight on-premises agent that listens for and responds to password validation requests.
- Installing multiple agents provides high availability of sign-in requests.

## What's available during preview?

>[!NOTE]
>Azure AD Pass-through Authentication is currently in preview. It is a free feature, and you don't need any paid editions of Azure AD to use it.

The following scenarios are fully supported during preview:

- All web browser-based applications
- Office 365 client applications that support [modern authentication](https://aka.ms/modernauthga)

The following scenarios are _not_ supported during preview:

- Legacy Office client applications and Exchange ActiveSync (that is, native email applications on mobile devices). Organizations are encouraged to switch to modern authentication, if possible. Modern authentication allows for Pass-through Authentication support but also helps you secure your identities by using [conditional access](../active-directory-conditional-access.md) features such as Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
- Azure AD Join for Windows 10 devices.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>As a workaround for scenarios not supported today, Password Hash Synchronization is also enabled by default when you enable Pass-through Authentication. Password Hash Synchronization acts as a fallback in these specific scenarios only. If you don't need these scenarios, you can turn off Password Hash Synchronization on the [Optional features](active-directory-aadconnect-get-started-custom.md#optional-features) page in the Azure AD Connect wizard.
