# Azure Active Directory Pass-through Authentication: Exchange ActiveSync support

## Overview

This article is for customers who want Exchange ActiveSync support with Azure AD Pass-through Authentication. Ensure that you use the instructions specific to your configuration:

- [Configuration 1: I have Exchange mailboxes and I am enabling Pass-through Authentication as my Azure AD sign-in method](configuration-1-i-have-exchange-mailboxes-and-i-am-enabling-pass-through-authentication-as-my-azure-ad-sign-in-method)
- [Configuration 2: I have Exchange mailboxes and I am switching from AD FS to Pass-through Authentication as my Azure AD sign-in method](configuration-2-i-have-exchange-mailboxes-and-i-am-switching-from-ad-fs-to-pass-through-authentication-as-my-azure-ad-sign-in-method)
- [Configuration 3: I already have Pass-through Authentication as my Azure AD sign-in method, and I am now setting up Exchange mailboxes](configuration-3-i-already-have-pass-through-authentication-as-my-azure-ad-sign-in-method-and-i-am-now-setting-up-exchange-mailboxes)

### Configuration 1: I have Exchange mailboxes and I am enabling Pass-through Authentication as my Azure AD sign-in method

1. Enable Pass-through Authentication on your tenant using the instructions in [this article](active-directory-aadconnect-pass-through-authentication-quick-start.md).
2. Use [Exchange PowerShell](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt587043(v=exchg.150).aspx) to run the following command:

```Get-OrganizationConfig | fl per*```

3. Check the value of the `PerTenantSwitchToESTSEnabled` setting. If the value is **true**, your tenant is correctly configured. If the value is **false**, run the following command:

```Set-OrganizationConfig -PerTenantSwitchToESTSEnabled:$true```

Contact Microsoft Support if Step 3 fails with the following error.

```TBD```

4. Ensure that the value of the `PerTenantSwitchToESTSEnabled` setting is set to **true**. At this stage, your tenant is correctly configured for Exchange ActiveSync support with Pass-through Authentication.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>It takes up to an hour for Exchange ActiveSync to start working after you complete all the instructions.

### Configuration 2: I have Exchange mailboxes and I am switching from AD FS to Pass-through Authentication as my Azure AD sign-in method

### Configuration 3: I already have Pass-through Authentication as my Azure AD sign-in method, and I am now setting up Exchange mailboxes
