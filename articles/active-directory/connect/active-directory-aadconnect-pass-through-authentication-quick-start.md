# Azure Active Directory Pass-through Authentication: Quick start

Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) Pass-through Authentication allows your users to sign in to both on-premises and cloud-based applications using the same passwords. It signs users in by validating their passwords directly against your on-premises Active Directory.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Azure AD Pass-through Authentication is currently in preview.

## How to deploy Azure AD Pass-through Authentication

To deploy Pass-through Authentication, you need to follow these instructions:
1. *Check prerequisites*: Set up your tenant and on-premises environment correctly before you enable the feature.
2. *Enable the feature*: Turn on Pass-through Authentication on your tenant and install a lightweight on-premises agent to handle password validation requests.
3. *Test the feature*: Test user sign-in using Pass-through Authentication.
4. *Ensure high availability*: Install a second standalone agent to provide high availability for sign-in requests.

## Step 1: Check prerequisites

Ensure that the following prerequisites are in place:

### On the Azure portal

1. Create a cloud-only Global Administrator account on your Azure AD tenant. This way, you can manage the configuration of your tenant should your on-premises services fail or become unavailable. Learn about [adding a cloud-only Global Administrator account](../active-directory-users-create-azure-portal.md). Doing this step is critical to ensure that you don't get locked out of your tenant.
2. Add one or more [custom domain name(s)](../active-directory-add-domain.md) to your Azure AD tenant. Your users sign in using one of these domain names.

### In your on-premises environment

1. Identify a server running Windows Server 2012 R2 or later on which to run Azure AD Connect. Add the server to the same AD forest as the users whose passwords need to be validated.
2. Install the [latest version of Azure AD Connect](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=47594) on the server identified in Step 2. If you already have Azure AD Connect running, ensure that the version is 1.1.557.0 or later.
3. Identify an additional server running Windows Server 2012 R2 or later on which to run a standalone Authentication Agent. The Authentication Agent version needs to be 1.5.193.0 or later. This server is needed to ensure high availability of sign-in requests. Add the server to the same AD forest as the users whose passwords need to be validated.
4. If there is a firewall between your servers and Azure AD, you need to configure the following items:
   - Open up your ports: Ensure that the Authentication Agents installed on your servers can make outbound requests to Azure AD over ports **80** (for downloading certificate revocation lists (CRLs) while validating the SSL certificate) and **443** (all outbound communication with our service). If your firewall enforces rules according to originating users, open these ports for traffic coming from Windows services running as a Network Service.
   - Allow Azure AD endpoints: If URL filtering is enabled, ensure that the Authentication Agents can communicate with **login.windows.net**, **login.microsoftonline.com**, **\*.msappproxy.net** and **\*.servicebus.windows.net**.
   - Verify direct IP connections: Ensure that the Authentication Agents on your servers can make direct IP connections to the [Azure data center IP ranges](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=41653).

## Step 2: Enable the feature

Pass-through Authentication can be enabled using [Azure AD Connect](active-directory-aadconnect.md).

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Pass-through Authentication can be enabled on the Azure AD Connect primary or staging server. It is highly recommended that you enable it from the primary server.

If you are installing Azure AD Connect for the first time, choose the [custom installation path](active-directory-aadconnect-get-started-custom.md). At the **User sign-in** page, choose **Pass-through Authentication** as the Sign on method. On successful completion, a Pass-through Authentication agent is installed on the same server as Azure AD Connect. In addition, the Pass-through Authentication feature is enabled on your tenant.

If you have already installed Azure AD Connect (using the [express installation](active-directory-aadconnect-get-started-express.md) or the [custom installation](active-directory-aadconnect-get-started-custom.md) path), select **Change user sign-in page** on Azure AD Connect, and click **Next**. Then select **Pass-through Authentication** as the Sign on method. On successful completion, a Pass-through Authentication agent is installed on the same server as Azure AD Connect and the feature is enabled on your tenant.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Pass-through Authentication is a tenant-level feature. Turning it on impacts sign-in for users across _all_ the managed domains in your tenant.

## Step 3: Test the feature

Follow these instructions to verify that you have enabled Pass-through Authentication correctly:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with the Global Administrator credentials for your tenant.
2. Select **Azure Active Directory** on the left hand navigation.
3. Select **Azure AD Connect**.
4. Verify that the **Pass-through Authentication** feature shows as **Enabled**.
5. Select **Pass-through Authentication**. This blade lists the servers where your Authentication Agents are installed.

![Azure portal - Pass-through Authentication blade](./media/active-directory-aadconnect-pass-through-authentication/pta8.png)

At this stage, users from all managed domains in your tenant can sign in using Pass-through Authentication. However, users from federated domains continue to sign in using Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) or another federation provider that you have previously configured. If you convert a domain from federated to managed, all users from that domain automatically start signing in using Pass-through Authentication. Cloud-only users are not impacted by the Pass-through Authentication feature.

## Step 4: Ensure high availability

If you plan to deploy Pass-through Authentication in a production environment, you should install a standalone Authentication Agent. Install this second Authentication Agent on a server _other_ than the one running Azure AD Connect and the first Authentication Agent. This setup provides you high availability of sign-in requests. Follow these instructions to deploy a standalone Authentication Agent:

1. **Download the latest version of the Authentication Agent (versions 1.5.193.0 or later)**: Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with your tenant's Global Administrator credentials.
2. Select **Azure Active Directory** on the left hand navigation.
3. Select **Azure AD Connect** and then **Pass-through Authentication**. And select **Download agent**.

5. Click the **Accept terms & download** button.

6. **Install the latest version of the Authentication Agent**: Run the executable downloaded in Step 5. Provide your tenant's Global Administrator credentials when prompted.
