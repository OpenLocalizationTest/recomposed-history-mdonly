# Tutorial: Configuring Citrix GoToMeeting for Automatic User Provisioning

The objective of this tutorial is to show you the steps you need to perform in Citrix GoToMeeting and Azure AD to automatically provision and de-provision user accounts from Azure AD to Citrix GoToMeeting.

## Prerequisites

The scenario outlined in this tutorial assumes that you already have the following items:

*   An Azure Active directory tenant.
*   A Citrix GoToMeeting single-sign on enabled subscription.
*   A user account in Citrix GoToMeeting with Team Admin permissions.

## Assigning users to Citrix GoToMeeting

Azure Active Directory uses a concept called "assignments" to determine which users should receive access to selected apps. In the context of automatic user account provisioning, only the users and groups that have been "assigned" to an application in Azure AD is synchronized.

Before configuring and enabling the provisioning service, you need to decide what users and/or groups in Azure AD represent the users who need access to your Citrix GoToMeeting app. Once decided, you can assign these users to your Citrix GoToMeeting app by following the instructions here:

[Assign a user or group to an enterprise app](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-coreapps-assign-user-azure-portal)

### Important tips for assigning users to Citrix GoToMeeting

*   It is recommended that a single Azure AD user is assigned to Citrix GoToMeeting to test the provisioning configuration. Additional users and/or groups may be assigned later.

*   When assigning a user to Citrix GoToMeeting, you must select a valid user role. The "Default Access" role does not work for provisioning.

## Enable Automated User Provisioning

This section guides you through connecting your Azure AD to Citrix GoToMeeting's user account provisioning API, and configuring the provisioning service to create, update, and disable assigned user accounts in Citrix GoToMeeting based on user and group assignment in Azure AD.

**Tip:** You may also choose to enabled SAML-based Single Sign-On for Citrix GoToMeeting, following the instructions provided in [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). Single sign-on can be configured independently of automatic provisioning, though these two features compliment each other.

### To configure automatic user account provisioning:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), browse to the **Azure Active Directory > Enterprise Apps > All applications** section.

2. If you have already configured Citrix GoToMeeting for single sign-on, search for your instance of Citrix GoToMeeting using the search field. Otherwise, select **Add** and search for **Citrix GoToMeeting** in the application gallery. Select Citrix GoToMeeting from the search results, and add it to your list of applications.

3. Select your instance of Citrix GoToMeeting, then select the **Provisioning** tab.

4. Set the **Provisioning** Mode to **Automatic**.

5. Under the Admin Credentials section, perform the following steps:
   
    a. In the **Citrix GoToMeeting Admin User Name** textbox, type the user name of an administrator.

    b. In the **Citrix GoToMeeting Admin Password** textbox, the administrator's password.

6. In the Azure portal, click **Test Connection** to ensure Azure AD can connect to your Citrix GoToMeeting app. If the connection fails, ensure your Citrix GoToMeeting account has Team Admin permissions and try the **"Admin Credentials"** step again.

7. Enter the email address of a person or group who should receive provisioning error notifications in the **Notification Email** field, and check the checkbox.

8. Click **Save.**

9. Under the Mappings section, select **Synchronize Azure Active Directory Users to Citrix GoToMeeting.**

10. In the **Attribute Mappings** section, review the user attributes that are synchronized from Azure AD to Citrix GoToMeeting. The attributes selected as **Matching** properties are used to match the user accounts in Citrix GoToMeeting for update operations. Select the Save button to commit any changes.

11. To enable the Azure AD provisioning service for Citrix GoToMeeting, change the **Provisioning Status** to **On** in the Settings section

12. Click **Save.**

It starts the initial synchronization of any users and/or groups assigned to Citrix GoToMeeting in the Users and Groups section. The initial sync takes longer to perform than subsequent syncs, which occur approximately every 20 minutes as long as the service is running. You can use the **Synchronization Details** section to monitor progress and follow links to provisioning activity reports, which describe all actions performed by the provisioning service on your Citrix GoToMeeting app.
