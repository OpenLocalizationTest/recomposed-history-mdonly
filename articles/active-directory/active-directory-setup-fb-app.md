# Azure Active Directory B2C - Provide sign up and sign in to consumers with Facebook accounts in your applications

## Create a Facebook application

To use Facebook as an identity provider in Azure AD B2C, you will first need to create a Facebook application and supply it with the right parameters. You will need a Facebook account to do this; if you donâ€™t have one, you can get it at [https://www.facebook.com/](https://www.facebook.com/).

1. Go to the [Facebook Developers website](https://developers.facebook.com/) and sign in with your Facebook account credentials.
2. If you have not already done so, click **Apps** then click **Register as a Developer**, accept the policy and follow the registration steps.
3. Click **Apps** and then **Add a new App**. Then choose **Website** as the platform, and then click **Skip and Create App ID**.
4. On the form, provide a **Display Name**, choose the appropriate **Category** and click **Create App ID**. Note: This requires you to accept Facebook Platform Policies and complete an online Security Check.
5. Click **Settings** on the left hand navigation. Enter a valid **Contact Email**.
6. Click on **+Add Platform** and then select **Website**.
7. Enter [https://login.microsoftonline.com/](https://login.microsoftonline.com/) in the **Site URL** field and then click **Save Changes**.
8. Copy the value of **App ID**. Click **Show** and copy the value of **App Secret**. You will need both of them to configure Facebook as an identity provider in your directory.

> [AZURE.NOTE]
**App Secret** is an important security credential.

9. Click the **Advanced** tab at the top, and then enter [https://login.microsoftonline.com/te/<directory>/oauth2/authresp](https://login.microsoftonline.com/te/<directory>/oauth2/authresp) in the **Valid OAuth redirect URIs** field (in the **Security** section), where **<directory>** is to be replaced with your directory's name (for e.g., contoso.onmicrosoft.com). Click **Save Changes** at the bottom of the page.
10. To make your Facebook application usable by Azure AD B2C, you need to make it publicly available. You can do this by clicking on **Status & Review** on the left navigation and turning the switch at the top of the page to **YES**. And click **Confirm**.

## Configure Facebook as an identity provider in your directory

1. Navigate to the B2C features blade on the [Azure Portal](htts://portal.azure.com/). Read [here](active-directory-b2c-app-registration.md#navigate-to-the-b2c-features-blade-on-the-azure-portal) on how to do this.
2. On the B2C features blade, click **Social identity providers**.
3. Click **+Add** at the top of the blade.
4. Provide a friendly **Name** for the identity provider configuration. For e.g., enter "Facebook (Contoso)".
5. Click **Identity provider type**, select **Facebook** and click **OK**.
6. Click **Set up this identity provider** and enter the **App ID** and **App secret** of the Facebook application that you created earlier.
7. Click **OK** and then **Create** to save your Facebook configuration.
