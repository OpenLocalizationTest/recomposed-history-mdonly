# About the Azure AD B2B collaboration preview
This article discusses the goals, features, and benefits of the refresh of the Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) B2B collaboration public preview.

Whether you're an IT pro or an information worker, you can take advantage of many Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) B2B collaboration capabilities. You can work closely with partners in other organizations everywhere, regardless of their size, industry, or compliance and governance requirements. And you can provide them access to documents, resources, and applications while you maintain complete control over your internal data.

If you're a developer, you can use the Azure AD B2B APIs to write applications that bring organizations together securely. For information-worker users, the process and navigation are straightforward.

## How B2B collaboration works

In the current preview release, IT pros and information workers establish relationships with partner organizations by adding their users one or a few at a time through the Azure portal or the invitation manager API.

Admins can use the new portal experiences in the Azure portal (https://portal.azure.com) and PowerShell to establish relationships.

Information workers can use the access-panel experiences in http://myapps.microsoft.com.

Developers can create applications by using the Azure AD B2B invitation manager API to add B2B collaboration users and customize the invitation and onboarding workflows.

B2B collaboration users are typically added through an invitation and redemption process. Here's how it works:

1. John Doe from WoodGrove wants to add Sam Oogle as a user with his Gmail address (gsamoogle@gmail.com).

2. John Doe goes to the WoodGrove portal (portal.azure.com) or access panel (myapps.microsoft.com), signs in, and then adds user Sam Oogle to the WoodGrove directory, or group or application.

3. John Doe specifies a custom invitation email to send to Sam Oogle.

4. When John Doe sends the invitation, user Sam Oogle is created in the WoodGrove Active Directory, as shown here:

  ![The admin user interface in portal.azure.com](media/active-directory-b2b-what-is-azure-ad-b2b/user-is-added.png)

5. After the user is created, Azure AD sends an invitation email to Sam Oogle:

  ![Invitation mail to Sam Oogle](media/active-directory-b2b-what-is-azure-ad-b2b/invitation-mail-sent-to-sam.png)

6. In the invitation, Sam Oogle selects **Get Started**.  
The Azure portal opens.

7. Sam Oogle signs in to the Azure portal.

8. Azure AD updates the Sam Oogle user object in the Active Directory with information from his token, as shown here:

  ![Sam Oogle user profile in the Azure portal](media/active-directory-b2b-what-is-azure-ad-b2b/user-profile-is-populated.png)

9. Now that user Sam Oogle has redeemed the invitation, he can access WoodGrove resources. And like any other user in the Active Directory, he can be managed by the administrator. The user list is shown here:

## Public preview features
Based on user feedback, the B2B collaboration public preview refresh provides key features that include:

* For administrators: get user interface enhancements in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). For example, administrators can invite B2B users to the directory, or to any group or application.  

* For information workers: get B2B collaboration self-service invitation capabilities in the [access panel](https://myapps.microsoft.com). Information workers can invite B2B collaboration users to any self-service group or application that they manage.

* Allow invited users to have any email address. Whether it's an Office 365 or on-premises Microsoft Exchange address, an outlook.com address, or any social address (Gmail, Yahoo!, and so on), users can access the invited organization with the creation of an Azure AD or Microsoft account.

* Create professional, tenant-branded invitation email.

* Customize user orientation by using the invitation APIs.

* Set up multi-factor authentication for B2B collaboration users in the inviting organization.

* Delegate invitations to non-administrators.

* Provide PowerShell support for B2B collaboration.

* Provide auditing and reporting capabilities.
