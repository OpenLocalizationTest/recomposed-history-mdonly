# Disable user sign-ins for an enterprise app in Azure Active Directory

It's easy to disable an enterprise application so that no users may sign in to it in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). You must have the appropriate permissions to manage the enterprise app. In the current preview, you must be global admin for the directory.

## How do I disable user sign-ins?

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with an account that's a global admin for the directory.

2. Select **More services**, enter Active Directory in the text box, and then select **Enter**.

3. On the **Azure Active Directory - *directoryname*** blade (that is, the Azure AD blade for the directory you are managing), select **Enterprise apps**.

6. On the ***appname*** blade (that is, the blade with the name of the selected app in the title), select **Properties**.
