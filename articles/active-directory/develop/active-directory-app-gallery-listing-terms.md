# Microsoft Azure Active Directory Application Gallery Terms & Conditions


*Last updated: March 2017*

Thank you for your interest in listing your application (“**App**”) in
the Microsoft Azure Active Directory Application Gallery (the
“**Gallery**”). These Gallery Terms & Conditions (“**Terms**”)
describe the relationship between you and Microsoft Corporation
(“**Microsoft**,” “**we**” or “**us**”) and governs the inclusion of
your App in the Gallery. PLEASE REVIEW THESE TERMS CAREFULLY. IF YOU
DO NOT AGREE WITH THESE TERMS, YOU SHOULD NOT SUBMIT YOUR APP FOR
LISTING IN THE GALLERY. IF YOU SUBMIT AN APP TO THE GALLERY, YOU AGREE
THAT YOU OR THE ENTITY YOU REPRESENT (“**YOU**” or “**YOUR**”) IS
BOUND BY THESE TERMS.

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** The Microsoft Marketplace Publisher Agreement DOES
NOT apply to the Gallery and DOES NOT govern the inclusion of your App
in the Gallery. These Terms constitute the entire agreement between
you and Microsoft with respect to your App and the Gallery. Microsoft
may update these Terms from time to time. By continuing to list your
App in the Gallery, you agree to be bound by the then-current Terms.

A.  **Description of the Gallery; Microsoft’s Rights**. The Gallery is a
    marketing platform that displays links to third party cloud-based
    multi-tenant SaaS business applications that support single sign-on
    with Azure Active Directory. The Apps listed in the Gallery must
    implement an integration mode and integrate with Azure Active
    Directory, according to our then-current requirements and
    instructions. Microsoft reserves the right to accept or reject your
    proposed App in its sole discretion and reserves the right to
    determine the manner in which Apps are presented, promoted, or
    featured in the Gallery.

B.  **App Submission Process**. To submit your App for consideration,
    you must follow our then-current instructions guidelines for
    submitting your App.

C.  **Your Marks and Logos**. If we list your App in the Gallery, you
    grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free, personal license to display
    the trademarks and logos you provide to us in connection with the
    marketing and promotion of your App in the Gallery (“**Your
    Marks**”). You represent that you are the owner or authorized
    licensor of Your Marks, and all goodwill associated with Your Marks
    inures to your or your licensor’s benefit. We may reformat or resize
    Your Marks as necessary without altering the overall appearance of
    Your Marks. You may notify us if you to request modifications to how
    Your Marks are used in the Gallery and we will correct such use
    within a reasonable time.

D.  **Relationship with Your Customers**. You are responsible for
    licensing and providing your App to any potential customer that is
    directed to your website from the Gallery (“**Your** **Customer**”).
    Any such license or grant of rights is between you and Your Customer
    and does not create any obligation or responsibilities for
    Microsoft. You understand that Microsoft will not directly provide
    or sell your App to Your Customers. You also understand that
    Microsoft will not provide any support to Your Customers.

E.  **Termination**. Microsoft reserves the right to remove your App
    from appearing in the Gallery at any time, for any or no reason.
    Microsoft also reserves the right to modify, update, or discontinue
    the Gallery at any time, without notice, and for any or no reason.
    To delete your App from the Gallery, send a request email to
    <waadpartners@microsoft.com>. After receiving your request, we will
    remove your App from the Gallery within a reasonable amount of time.

F.  **Disclaimer**. The Gallery is provided to you “AS-IS” and
    “AS-AVAILABLE.” You are listing your App in the Gallery at your own
    risk. MICROSOFT DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR
    IMPLIED, OF MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR
    NON-INFRINGEMENT. MICROSOFT IS NOT LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES OF ANY
    KIND ARISING FROM THE LISTING OF YOUR APP IN THE GALLERY, INCLUDING,
    BUT NOT LIMITED TO DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, PUNITIVE, AND
    CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, UNLESS OTHERWISE SPECIFIED IN WRITING.
    CERTAIN STATE LAWS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR
    THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES. IF THESE LAWS APPLY
    TO YOU, SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE DISCLAIMERS OR LIMITATIONS MAY NOT
    APPLY TO YOU. The disclaimers and limitations set forth in this
    Section F pertain to you solely with respect to your App’s listing
    in the Gallery. These Terms do not apply to your use of any Azure
    services or in your capacity as an Azure customer, if applicable.

G.  **Miscellaneous**. These Terms are governed by the laws of the State
    of Washington and any dispute relating to these Terms must be
    brought in the federal courts in King County, Washington. The
    parties acknowledge that these Terms are non-exclusive and neither
    party is prohibited from engaging in similar or competitive
    activities with other third parties. You may not assign any rights
    or obligations under these Terms without our prior written consent,
    except for an assignment by you: (1) to an affiliate; or (2) in
    connection with a merger, acquisition, or sale of all or
    substantially all of its assets. Subject to the foregoing, these
    Terms are binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and
    their permitted successors and assigns. Except as expressly
    provided, nothing in these Terms transfers, conveys, or grants any
    right, title, or interest in any software or other materials
    exchanged by the parties.
