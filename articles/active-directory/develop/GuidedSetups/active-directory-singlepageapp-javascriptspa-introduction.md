# Call the Microsoft Graph API from a JavaScript Single Page Application (SPA)

This guide demonstrates how a JavaScript Single Page Application (SPA) can sign-in, get an access token and call Microsoft Graph API or other APIs that require access tokens from Azure Active Directory v2 endpoint.

At the end of this guide, your application will be able to call Graph API using personal accounts (including outlook.com, live.com, and others) as well as work and school accounts from any company or organization that has Azure Active Directory

### More Information

The sample application created by this guide enables JavaScript SPA to query Microsoft Graph API or a Web API that accepts tokens from Azure Active Directory v2 endpoint. For this scenario, after user signs-in, a token is added to HTTP requests via the Authorization header. Token acquisition and renewal is handled by the Microsoft Authentication Library (MSAL).
