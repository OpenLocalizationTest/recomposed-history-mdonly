> Note
> ### Restricting users from only one organization to sign in to your application
> By default, personal accounts (including outlook.com, live.com, and others) as well as work and school accounts from any company or organization that has integrated with Azure Active Directory can sign in to your application. If you want your application to accept sign-ins only from one organization, replace the `Tenant` parameter in `web.config` from `Common` to the tenant name of the organization – example, `contoso.onmicrosoft.com`. After that, change the *ValidateIssuer* argument in your OWIN Startup class to `true`.
To allow users from only a list of specific organizations, set `ValidateIssuer` to `true` and use the `ValidIssuers` parameter to specify a list of organizations.
Another option is to implement a custom method to validate the issuers using `IssuerValidator parameter`. For more information about `TokenValidationParameters`, please see [this](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.identitymodel.tokens.tokenvalidationparameters(v=vs.114).aspx) MSDN article.
