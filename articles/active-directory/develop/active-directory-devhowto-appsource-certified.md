# How to get AppSource Certified for Azure Active Directory (AD)
[AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/) is the premier destination to market and distribute your apps, content packs, and add-ins â€” all backed by a brand that billions of customers already know and trust.

To receive AppSource certification for Azure Active Directory, your application must accept single sign-on from work accounts from any company or organization that has Azure Active Directory. The sign-in process must use the OpenID Connect or OAuth 2.0 protocols.

## Guides and code samples
Gor code samples and guides for your platform, see [this document](active-directory-developers-guide#get-started "Get Started with Azure AD for developers")

## Multi-tenant applications
An application that accepts sign-ins from users from any company or organization that have Azure Active Directory without requiring a separate instance, configuration, or deployment is known as a multi-tenant application. AppSource recommends that applications implement multi-tenancy to enable the single-click customer-led trial experience.

For more information about multi-tenancy, see: [How to sign in any Azure Active Directory (AD) user using the multi-tenant application pattern](active-directory-devhowto-multi-tenant-overview).

## Trial Experience
AppSource recommends offering a trial option for users to allow them to use your application for a limited time with no cost. The trial experience can be timed-based, as well as reduced functionality, and can take two possible forms:
