# How to get AppSource Certified for Azure Active Directory
[Microsoft AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/) is a destination for business users to discover, try and manage line of business SaaS applications (standalone SaaS and add-on to existing Microsoft SaaS products).

To list a standalone SaaS application on AppSource, your application must accept single sign-on from work accounts from any company or organization that has Azure Active Directory. The sign-in process must use the OpenID Connect or OAuth 2.0 protocols - integration via SAML protocol does not qualify for certification.

## Guides and code samples
For code samples and guides for your platform, see the [Azure Active Directory developer's guide](./active-directory-developers-guide.md#get-started "Get Started with Azure AD for developers")

## Multi-tenant applications
An application that accepts sign-ins from users from any company or organization that have Azure Active Directory without requiring a separate instance, configuration, or deployment is known as a *multi-tenant application*. AppSource recommends that applications implement multi-tenancy to enable the *single-click* free trial experience.

For more information about multi-tenancy, see: [How to sign in any Azure Active Directory (AD) user using the multi-tenant application pattern](./active-directory-devhowto-multi-tenant-overview.md).

### Free Trial (Customer-led trial experience) 
The *customer-led trial* is the experience that AppSource recommends as it offers a single-click access to your application. Below an illustration of how this experience looks like:

<table >
<tr>
    <td valign="top" width="33%">1.<br/><img src="media/active-directory-devhowto-appsource-certified/customer-led-trial-step1.png" width="85%"/><ul><li>User finds your application in AppSource Web Site</li><li>Selects ‘Free trial’ option</li></ul></td>
    <td valign="top" width="33%">2.<br/><img src="media/active-directory-devhowto-appsource-certified/customer-led-trial-step2.png" width="85%" /><ul><li>AppSource redirects user to a URL in your web site</li><li>Your web site starts the <i>single-sign-on</i> process automatically (on page load)</li></ul></td>
    <td valign="top" width="33%">3.<br/><img src="media/active-directory-devhowto-appsource-certified/customer-led-trial-step3.png" width="85%"/><ul><li>User is redirected to Microsoft Sign-in page</li><li>User provides credentials to sign in</li></ul></td>
</tr>
<tr>
    <td valign="top" width="33%">4.<br/><img src="media/active-directory-devhowto-appsource-certified/customer-led-trial-step4.png" width="85%"/><ul><li>User gives consent for your application</li></ul></td>
    <td valign="top" width="33%">5.<br/><img src="media/active-directory-devhowto-appsource-certified/customer-led-trial-step5.png" width="85%"/><ul><li>Sign-in completes and user is redirected back to your web site</li><li>User starts the free trial</li></ul></td>
    <td></td>
</tr>
</table>

### Request Trial (Partner-led trial experience)
The *partner trial experience* can be used when a manual or a long-term operation need to happen to provision the user/ company to be able to access your application: for example, your application need to provision virtual machines, database instances, or operations that take much time to complete. In this case, after user selects the Request Trial button and fills out a form, AppSource sends you the user contact's information, then you provision the environment and send information to the user on how to access the trial experience.

        </tr>
        </table><br/><br/>
        <ul><li>You receive user's information and setup trial instance</li><li>You send user's an hyperlink to access your application</li></ul>
    </td>
