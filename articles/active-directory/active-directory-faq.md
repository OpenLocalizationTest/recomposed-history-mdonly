# Azure Active Directory FAQ

Azure AD is a comprehensive IDaaS solution spanning all aspects of identity, access management, and security. For a general overview of Azure AD please look at 

## Accessing Azure and Azure AD

**Q: I cannot find Azure AD in http://portal.azure.com?**

**A:** Azure AD administration experience is still offered through http://manage.windowsazure.com; we expect a public preview of the new administration experiences to be available in Sept 2016. Get all Azure AD announcements [Alex’s AAD blog]

---

**Q: When trying to access Azure AD on http://manage.windowsazure.com I get “No subscriptions found”?**

**A:** you will need permissions on an Azure subscription, if you have a paid Office 365 or Azure AD navigate to http://aka.ms/accessAAD for a one-time activation step, otherwise you will need to activate a full Azure trial or paid subscription. Azure trial [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial/]

---

**Q: What’s the connection between Azure AD, Office 365, and Azure?**

**A:** Azure AD enables all Microsoft Online services with common identity and access management capabilities. Learn more [https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/ad/2016/02/26/azure-ad-mailbag-azure-subscriptions-and-azure-ad-2/]

---

**Q: Which Azure AD features are available for free?**

**A:** Azure AD is available as a free solution enabling a clod IDaaS, synchronization from an on-premises directory, and SSO access to up to 10 pre-integrated cloud applications through individual assignment. With Office 365 you can also enable directory branding, and cloud only SSPR and MFA for office applications. All other Azure AD capabilities require a paid subscription for Azure AD.

Q: **How can I connect my on-premises directory to Azure AD?**

A: using Azure AD Connect [here] you can connect your on-premises directory to an Azure AD to provision users, groups, and devices and maintain their synchronization over time. Azure AD connect includes support for Active Directory on premises as well as several other directory types. In many cases you could even connect your HR system to provision to both an on-premises directory and Azure AD.

---

**Q: How do I set up SSO between my on-premises directory and cloud applications?**

**A:** You only need to setup SSO between your on-premises directory and Azure AD. As long as all other cloud applications are managed through Azure AD that SSO experience will carry through. Enabling SSO from on-premises to Azure AD can be done through federation or, in the case of AD on-premises, through password hash sync. The Azure AD connect wizard will help guide you through the installation and even configure your ADFS federation if you choose that option.

**Q: Does Azure AD help me manage my on-premises infrastructure?**

**A:** With Azure AD premium, Azure AD connect health enables you to monitor your on-premises identity ingratitude from the cloud. Learn more about Azure AD connect health [link to AAD connect health intro article]
Other questions on Azure AD connect and connect health are addressed Azure AD Connect FAQ [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-aadconnect-faq/] and Azure AD Connect Health Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-aadconnect-health-faq/]


## Password management

**Q: Can I use Azure AD password writeback without password hash sync? (AKA, I would like to use Azure AD SSPR with password writeback but I don’t want my passwords stored in the cloud?)**

**A:** You do not need to synchronize your AD passwords to Azure AD in order to enable writeback. When used with federation Azure AD SSO relies on the on-premises directory to authenticate the user and NO record of the password is recorded in Azure AD.

---

**Q: How long does it take for a password to be written back to AD on-premises?**

**A:** Password Writeback is instant. It is a synchronous pipeline that works fundamentally differently than password hash synchronization. Password Writeback allows users to get realtime feedback about the success of their password reset or change operation. The average time for a successful writeback of a password is under 500 ms.

---

**Q: Can I use password writeback with Administrator managed password?**

**A:** Yes, when password writeback is enabled administrator password operations are written back to on-premises using the same mechanisms. Neither the administrator nor the user need to know where the password is stored, Azure AD make this decision and drives the appropriate workflow depending on the specific user’s authentication configuration.
Other questions on Azure AD password management are addressed through Password Management Frequently Asked Questions [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/active-directory-passwords-faq/]


## Application access


**Q: Where do I find out about which applications are pre-integrated with Azure AD and what are their capabilities?**

**A:** Azure AD has over 2600 pre-integrated applications. The applications are integrated by Microsoft, the application service provider, or partners. All pre-integrated applications support SSO, enabling users to use their organizational credentials for access. Some of the applications also support automated provisioning and de-provisioning. For a full list of pre-integrated applications please refer to the Azure AD marketplace [https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/active-directory/]

---

**Q: What if the application I need is not in the Azure AD marketplace?**

**A:** With Azure AD premium you can add and configure any application you want. In these cases, SSO can be achieved through either SAML or password SSO depending on the application’s capabilities and your preferences. When the application itself exposes APIs or a provisioning service, automated provisioning can be configured through Azure AD SCIM endpoint. Learn more about adding your own applications []

---

**Q: Can I add applications I’m running on-premises?**

**A:** Azure AD cloud application proxy enables you easily publish your on-premises applications to mobile internet access. The users get a consistent SSO experience, identical to their cloud applications, and they do NOT have to VPN to access. You get enhanced security since the solution does NOT require any inbound access to your network. Learn more about Azure AD cloud application proxy []

--- 

**Q: How do I require MFA for users accessing a particular application?**

**A:** Using Azure AD conditional access you can assign a unique access policy for each application. Through this you can require MFA at all times, or when users are away from the local network. You can also apply other conditions like a known or healthy device. You can even block access to your cloud apps when users are not on the corporate network.
