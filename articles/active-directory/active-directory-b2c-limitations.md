# Azure Active Directory B2C preview: Limitations & Restrictions

There are several features & functionalities of Azure Active Directory (AD) B2C that are not yet supported during the preview. Many of these limitations will be removed before Azure AD B2C reaches general availability, but you should be aware of them if you are building consumer-facing applications during preview.

## Support for Production Applications

Applications that integrate with Azure AD B2C should not be released to the public as production level applications. Azure AD B2C is in preview at this time - breaking changes may be introduced at any point in time, and there is no SLA guaranteed by the service. Support will not be provided for any incidents that may occur. If you are willing to accept the risks of taking a dependency on a service that is still in development, you must tweet us @AzureAD to discuss the scope of your application or service.
