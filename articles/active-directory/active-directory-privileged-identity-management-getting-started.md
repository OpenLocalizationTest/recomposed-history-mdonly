# Get started with Azure AD Privileged Identity Management


Azure Active Directory (AD) Privileged Identity Management lets you manage, control, and monitor your privileged identities and access to resources in Azure AD as well as other Microsoft online services like Office 365 or Microsoft Intune.  

You can start using Azure AD Privileged Identity Management by accessing the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/). Azure AD Privileged Identity Management does not appear in the earlier classic portal. You must be a global administrator with an organizational account, not a Microsoft Account, to enable Azure AD Privileged Identity Management for a directory.

## Add the Privileged Identity Management application

To use Azure AD Privileged Identity Management, first add the application to your Azure portal dashboard.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) as an organizational account that is a global administrator of your directory.
2. If your organization has more than one directory, click on your username in the upper right hand corner of the Azure portal, and select the directory where you will use PIM.
3. Select the **New** icon in the left navigation.
4. Select **Security + Identity** from the menu.
5. Select **Azure AD Privileged Identity Management**.
6. Check **Pin to dashboard** and then click the **Create** button. The Privileged Identity Management application will open.

If you're the first person to use Azure AD Privileged Identity Management in your directory, then the [security wizard](active-directory-privileged-identity-management-security-wizard.md) will walk you through the initial assignment experience. After that, you will automatically become the first **Security administrator** of the directory. Only a security administrator can access this application to manage the access for other administrators.  

Otherwise, assuming you've been assigned to one or more roles by another security administrator, you'll have a choice of which role to activate. If you are in a security administrator role yourself, you'll also see a choice to **Manage Identities**.
