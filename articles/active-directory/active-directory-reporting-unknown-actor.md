On rare occasions, you may see unusual values in the "Actor" or "User" fields in Azure AD Reports. This behavior is expected, and is caused by one of two events:

## A Service Principal is acting on the directory, without a user context

In this case, a Service Principal (Application) is performing directory updates without actually signing in as a user. This causes the Service Principal's ID to show up as the Actor, instead of a UPN. Here's an example:

This is a known bug, and we are working diligently to resolve it.

## A user was deleted from the directory before the event was processed

In this case, a user was deleted from the directory before we processed the event and associated a username with it. Here's an example:

This is a known bug, and we are working diligently to resolve it.
