# Add B2B collaboration users without an invitation

If the inviter belongs to a role that has enumeration privileges in the directory of the partner organization, from which he or she is adding users, the invited users are added into the inviting organization without needing invitations.

This is the scenario in which this is most useful:

1. A user in the host organization (for example, WoodGrove) invites one user from the partner organization (for example, Sam@litware.com) as Guest.
2. The admin in the host organization sets up policies that allow Sam to identify and add other users from the partner organization (Litware).
3. Now Sam can add other users from Litware to the WoodGrove directory, groups or applications without needing invitations to be redeemed. If Sam has the appropriate enumeration privileges in Litware, this happens automatically.
