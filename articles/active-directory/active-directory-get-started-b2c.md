# Get started with Azure Active Directory B2C

**Azure Active Directory B2C** is a comprehensive, cloud-based consumer identity and access management service for your consumer-facing applications built to run on any platform, and to be accessible from any device. It is a highly-available, global service that can support hundreds of millions of consumer identities. Built on the same enterprise-grade technology used by Azure Active Directory, Azure Active Directory B2C keeps your business and consumers protected. To learn more, click [here](B2C marketing site).

To start using Azure Active Directory B2C, follow the steps below.

## Step 1: Sign up for an Azure subscription

If you already have an Azure subscription move to the next step. If not, sign up for [an Azure Subscription](sign-up-organization) and get access to Azure Active Directory B2C.

> [AZURE.NOTE]
Azure Active Directory B2C is currently free for use, but is limited (up to 50,000 users per directory). An Azure subscription is only needed to access the [Azure Management Portal](http://manage.windowsazure.com/) and won't be used to bill your usage.

## Step 2: Create an Azure Active Directory directory with B2C features

Use the following steps to create a new Azure Active Directory directory with B2C features. Currently B2C features can't be turned on in your existing directory.

1. Sign into the [Azure Management Portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com/) as the Subscription administrator. This is the same work or school account or the same Microsoft Account that you used to sign up for Azure.
2. Click **New** > **App Services** > **Active Directory** > **Directory** > **Custom Create**.
3. Choose the **name**, **domain name** and **country or region** for your directory.
4. Check the option that says "**This is a B2C directory**".
5. Click the check mark to complete the action.
6. Your directory with B2C features is now created and will appear in the Active Directory extension. You are also made a Global administrator of the directory. You can add other Global administrators as required.

## Step 3: Manage B2C features on the Azure Portal

The B2C features on your directory can be managed on the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/); only a Global administrator can do this. You can manage users and groups, self-service password reset configuration and company branding features of your directory on the [Azure Management Portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com/).

1. Navigate to the directory (with B2C features) on the Active Directory extension.
2. Click on the **Configure** tab.
3. Click on the **Manage B2C settings** link in the **B2C administration** section.
4. The [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) with the B2C features blade will open in a new browser window.
5. Pin this blade to your Startboard for easy access.
