# Get started with Azure Active Directory B2C

**Azure Active Directory B2C** is a comprehensive, cloud-based consumer identity and access management service for your consumer-facing applications built to run on any platform, and to be accessible from any device. It is a highly-available, global service that can support hundreds of millions of consumer identities. Built on the same enterprise-grade technology used by Azure Active Directory, Azure Active Directory B2C keeps your business and consumers protected. To learn more, click [here](B2C marketing site).

To start using Azure Active Directory B2C, follow the steps below.

## Step 1: Sign up for an Azure subscription

If you already have an Azure subscription move to the next step. If not, sign up for a [free Azure trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial/) and get access to Azure Active Directory B2C.

> [AZURE.NOTE]
Azure Active B2C is currently free for use, but is limited (up to 50,000 users per directory). An Azure subscription is only needed to access the [Azure Management Portal](http://manage.windowsazure.com/) and won't be used to bill your usage.

## Step 2: Create an Azure Active Directory B2C directory

Use the following instructions to create a new Azure Active Directory directory with B2C features. Currently B2C features can't be turned on in your existing directory.

1. Sign into the [Azure Management Portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com/) as the Subscription administrator. This is the same work or school account or the same Microsoft Account that you used to sign up for Azure.
2. Click New > App Services > Active Directory > Directory > Custom Create.
3. Choose the name, domain name and country or region for your B2C directory.
4. Check the option that says "This is a B2C directory".
5. Click the check mark to complete the action.
6. Your B2C directory is now created and will appear in the Active Directory extension. By default, you are also made a Global administrator of the B2C directory. You can add other Global administrators as required.

## Step 3: Access B2C features on the Azure Portal

The B2C features on your directory can be managed on the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/); only a Global administrator of the directory can do this. You can manage users and groups, self-service password reset configuration and company branding features of your directory on the [Azure Management Portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com/).

1. Navigate to the directory (that has B2C features turned on) on the Active Directory extension.
2. Click on the **Configure** tab.
3. Click on the **Manage B2C settings** link in the **B2C administration** section.
4. The [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/) with the B2C features blade will open in a new browser window.
5. Pin this blade to your Startboard for easy access.
