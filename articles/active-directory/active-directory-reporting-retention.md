# Azure Active Directory report retention policies
*This documentation is part of the [Azure Active Directory Reporting Guide](active-directory-reporting-guide.md).*



This topic provides an overview of data retention for the different activity reports in Azure Active Directory. 

When does the collection of your activity data start?

| Azure AD Edition | Collection Start |
| :--              | :--   |
|Premium and Premium 2 | When you sign-up for a license |
| Free | When you sign on to the Azure portal or the first time you are using the reporting APIs |


When is your activity data available in the Azure portal?

- **Immediately** - If you have already been working with reports in the Azure classic portal
- **Within 2 hours** - If you havenâ€™t turned reporting on  in the Azure classic portal

The collection process for activity data starts when you open the Azure Active Directory blade.

For security signals, the collection process starts when you opt-in to use the Identity Protection Center.
