# Remove a user or group assignment from an enterprise app in Azure Active Directory

It's easy to remove a user or a group from being assigned access to one of your enterprise applications in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). You must have the appropriate permissions to manage the enterprise app. In the current preview, you must be global admin for the directory.

## How do I remove a user or group assignment?

1.  Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with an account that's a global admin for the directory.

2.  Select **More services**, enter Active Directory in the text box, and then select **Enter**.

3. On the **Azure Active Directory - *directoryname*** blade (that is, the Azure AD blade for the directory you are managing), select **Enterprise apps**.
