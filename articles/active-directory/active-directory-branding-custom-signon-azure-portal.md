# Add company branding to your sign-in page in the Azure Active Directory
To avoid confusion, many companies want to apply a consistent look and feel across all the websites and services they manage. Azure Active Directory provides this capability by allowing you to customize the appearance of the sign-in page with your company logo and custom color schemes. The sign-in page is the page that appears when you sign in to Office 365 or other web-based applications that are using Azure AD as your identity provider. You interact with this page to enter your credentials.

> [!NOTE]
> * Company branding is available only if you upgraded to the Premium or Basic edition of Azure AD, or have an Office 365 license. For more information, see [Azure Active Directory editions](active-directory-editions.md).
> 
> * Azure Active Directory Premium and Basic editions are available for customers in China using the worldwide instance of Azure Active Directory. Azure Active Directory Premium and Basic editions are not currently supported in the Microsoft Azure service operated by 21Vianet in China. For more information, contact us at the [Azure Active Directory Forum](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/169401-azure-active-directory/).

## Customizing the sign-in page

You can customize the following elements on the sign-in page:

&lt;Kelvin to attach image&gt;

Company branding customizations appear on the Azure AD sign-in page when users access a tenant-specific URL such as
[*https://outlook.com/contoso.com*](https://outlook.com/contoso.com).

When users visit a generic URL such as www.office.com, the sign-in page
does not contain company branding customizations because the system
doesn’t know who the user is. Company branding will show after users
enter their user ID or select a user tile.

> [!NOTE]
> * A new sign-in page design is currently being rolled out. This article describes how to customize the new design. If you are looking for help with the old design, see [Add company branding to sign-in and Access Panel pages](active-directory-add-company-branding.md).
> * Your domain name must appear as “Active" in the **Domains** portion of the Azure portal in which you have configured branding. For more information, see [Add custom domain names](active-directory-domains-add-azure-portal.md).
> * Sign-in page branding doesn’t carry over to the sign-in page for personal Microsoft accounts. If your employees or business guests sign in with a personal Microsoft account, their sign-in page does not reflect the branding of your organization.

## Customizable elements

Description | Constraints | Recommendations

### Banner logo	

Description | Constraints | Recommendations

## Sign-in page image	
Description | Constraints | Recommendations

### Background Color
Description | Constraints | Recommendations
------- | ------- | ----------
This color is used in place of the background image on low-bandwidth connections. |	RGB color in hexadecimal (example: #FFFFFF | We suggest using the primary color of the banner logo or your organization color.

###Show option to remain signed in
Description | Constraints | Recommendations
------- | ------- | ----------
Azure AD sign in gives the user the option to remain signed in when they close and re-open their browser. Use this to hide that option.<br>Set this to “No” to hide this option from your users. | &nbsp; | This does not affect session lifetime.<br>Some features of SharePoint Online and Office 2010 depend on users being able to choose to remain signed in. If you set this to be hidden, your users may see additional and unexpected prompts to sign-in.

> [!NOTE]
> All elements are optional. For example, if you specify a banner logo with no background image, the sign-in page will show your logo and the background image for the destination site (for example, Office 365).
