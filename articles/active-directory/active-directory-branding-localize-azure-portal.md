# Add language-specific company branding to your sign-in page in the Azure Active Directory

You can add language-specific elements to your custom sign-in page only if you have already created a custom sign-in page as described in [Add company branding to your sign-in page](active-directory-branding-custom-signon-azure-portal.md). You can configure one sign-in page per directory with a default set of customizable elements. After youâ€™ve configured the default set of page elements, you can configure more versions for different locales. 

## Example of this branding

You can also mix and match various elements across the default and locale-specific branding set. Imagine the following configuration: 

* A default background image and banner logo
* A language-specific banner logo for German

When the sign-in page is loaded in German, the default background image shows with the German logo.

## To add language-specific company branding to your directory

1. Sign in to the [Azure AD admin center](https://aad.portal.azure.com) with an account that's a global admin for the directory.
2. Select **Users and groups** in the text box, and then select **Enter**.

3. On the **Users and groups** blade, select **Company branding**.
4. On the **Users and groups - Company branding** blade, select the **Add language** command.

5. Modify the elements you want to customize. All elements are optional.
6. Click **Save**.

It can take up to an hour for any changes you made to the sign-in page branding to appear.
