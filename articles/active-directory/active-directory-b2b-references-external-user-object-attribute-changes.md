## External user object attribute changes for Azure Active Directory B2B collaboration preview
The user object in Azure AD undergoes attribute changes in various stages of the B2B collaboration invite-redeem flow. The user object representing the partner user in the directory has attributes that change at redeem time, when the partner user clicks the link in the invite email. Specifically, the attributes

- SignInName and AltSecId are populated
- DisplayName changes from the User Principle Name (user_fabrikam.com#EXT#@contoso.com) to the sign in name (user@fabrikam.com)

Tracking these attributes in Azure AD can identify whether or not a partner user has redeemed their B2B collaboration invitation.
