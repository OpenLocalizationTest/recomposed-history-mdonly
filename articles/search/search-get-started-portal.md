# Build and query your first Azure Search index in the portal

In the Azure portal, start with a predefined sample dataset to quickly generate an index using the **Import data** wizard. Explore full text search, filters, facets, fuzzy search, and geosearch with **Search explorer**.  

This code-free introduction gets you started with predefined data so that you can write interesting queries right away. While portal tools are not a substitute for code, they are useful for these tasks:

+ Prototype an index before you write code in **Import data**
+ Test-drive queries and compare parser behaviors in **Search explorer**
+ View an existing index published to your service and look up its attributes

> [!NOTE]
> This tutorial assumes an [Azure subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) and [Azure Search service](search-create-service-portal.md). 
> 

The tutorial takes about 15-30 minutes to complete, depending on whether account or service sign-up is also required. 

Alternatively, you can watch a 5-minute demonstration of the steps in this tutorial at about four minutes into this [Azure Search Overview video](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Connect/2016/138).

## Find your service
1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Open the service dashboard of your Azure Search service. If you didn't pin the service tile to your dashboard, you can find your service this way: 
   
   * In the Jumpbar, click **More services** at the bottom of the left navigation pane.
   * In the search box, type *search* to get a list of search services for your subscription. Your service should appear in the list. 

## Check for space
Many customers start with the free service. This version is limited to three indexes, three data sources, and three indexers. Make sure you have room for extra items before you begin. This tutorial creates one of each object. 

Tiles on the service dashboard show how many indexes, indexers, and data sources you already have. The Indexer tile shows success and failure indicators. Click the tile to view the indexer count. 

  ![Tiles for indexers and datasources][1]

## Create an index and load data
Search queries iterate over an *index* containing searchable data, metadata, and constructs used for optimizing certain search behaviors.

To keep this task portal-based, we use a built-in sample dataset that can be crawled using an indexer via the **Import data** wizard. 

#### Step 1: Start the Import data wizard
1. On your Azure Search service dashboard, click **Import data** in the command bar to start a wizard that both creates and populates an index.
   
    ![Import data command][2]

2. In the wizard, click **Data Source** > **Samples** > **realestate-us-sample**. This data source is preconfigured with a name, type, and connection information. Once created, it becomes an "existing data source" that can be reused in other import operations.
3. Click **OK** to create the data source.

#### Step 2: Define the index
The wizard can usually generate an index for any data source it can crawl. Minimally, an index requires a name, and a fields collection, with one field marked as the document key to uniquely identify each document.

Fields have data types and attributes. The check boxes across the top of the field list are *index attributes* that control how the field is used. 

* **Retrievable** means that it shows up in search results list. You can mark individual fields as off limits for search results by clearing this checkbox, for example when fields used only in filter expressions. 
* **Filterable**, **Sortable**, and **Facetable** determine whether a field can be used in a filter, a sort, or a facet navigation structure. 
* **Searchable** means that a field is included in full text search. Strings are searchable. Numeric fields and Boolean fields are often marked as not searchable. 

By default, the wizard chooses the first field in the collection as the key. Strings are attributed as retrievable and searchable. Integers are attributed as retrievable, filterable, sortable, and facetable.

  ![Generated realestate index][3]

Click **OK** to create the index.

#### Step 3: Define the indexer
Still in the **Import data** wizard, click **Indexer** > **Name**, and type a name for the indexer. 

This object defines an executable process. You could put it on recurring schedule, but for now use the default option to run the indexer once, immediately, when you click **OK**.

## Check progress
To check progress, go back to the service dashboard, scroll down, and double-click the **Indexers** tile to open the indexers list. You should see the newly created indexer in the list, with status indicating "in progress" or success, along with the number of documents indexed.

   ![Indexer progress message][4]

## Query the index
You now have a search index that's ready to query. **Search explorer** is a query tool built into the portal. It provides a search box so that you can verify a search input returns the data you expect. 

   ![Search explorer command][5]

In the [Azure Search Overview video](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Connect/2016/138), the following steps are demonstrated at 6m24s into the video.

1. Click **Search explorer** on the command bar.

2. Click **Change index** on the command bar to switch to *realestate-us-sample*.

   ![Index and API commands][6]

3. Click **Set API version** on the command bar to see which REST APIs are available. Preview APIs give you access to new features not yet generally released. Use the generally available version (2016-09-01) unless directed. 

    > [!NOTE]
    > Azure Search REST API and the [.NET library]() are fully equivalent, but **Search explorer** is only equipped to REST calls. It accepts syntax for both [simple query syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/simple-query-syntax-in-azure-search) and [full Lucene query parser](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/lucene-query-syntax-in-azure-search), plus all the search parameters available in [Search Document](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/search-documents) operations.
    > 
    > **Search explorer** returns results in JSON, which is verbose and hard to read if documents have a dense structure. Depending on your documents, you might need to write code that handles search results to extract important elements.

4. In the search bar, enter the query strings below.

**`search=seattle`**
`search=` is used to input a keyword search, in this case, returning listings in King County, Washington state,  containing Seattle in any field in the document.

  ![Search query example][7]

**`search=seattle&facet=beds`**
`facet` is a search parameter that returns categories and a count. In this case, returning categories based on the number of bedrooms, with a count of the documents or matches for each one. `"beds"` can be specified as a facet because it is marked as a filterable and facetable field in the index, and the values it contains (numeric, 1 through 5), are suitable for categorizing listings into groups (listings with 3 bedrooms, 4 bedrooms).  The `&` symbol is used to append search parameters.

**`search=seattle&filter=bed gt 3`**
`filter` is a search parameter for returning results matching filter criteria. In this case, bedrooms greater than 3. Filter syntax is an OData construction. For more information, see [Filter OData syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/odata-expression-syntax-for-azure-search).

**`search=granite countertops&highlight=description`**
Hit highlights add formatting to text matching the keyword, given matches found in a specific field. If your search term is deeply buried in a description, you can add hit highlighting to make it easier to spot. In this case, the formatted phrase `"granite countertops"` is easier to see in the description field.

**`search=mice&highlight=description`**
Full text search finds word forms with similar semantics. In this case, search results contain highlighted text for "mouse", for homes that have mouse infestation, in response to a keyword search on "mice". Different forms of the same word can appear in results because of linguistic analysis. Azure Search supports 56 analyzers from both Lucene and Microsoft. The default used by Azure Search is the standard Lucene analyzer. 

**`search=samamish`**
Misspelled words, like 'samamish' for the Samammish plateau in the SEattle area, fail to return matches in typical search. To handle misspellings, you can use fuzzy search, described in the next example.

**`search=samamish~&queryType=full`**
Fuzzy search is enabled when you specify the `~` symbol and use the full query parser, which interprets and correctly parses the `~` syntax. By default, the simple query parser is used because its faster, but you can opt in for the full query parser if you require fuzzy search, regular expressions, or proximity search. For more information about query scenarios enabled by the full parser, see [Lucene query syntax in Azure Search](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/lucene-query-syntax-in-azure-search).

**`search=*`**
Empty searches return everything. You might use an empty query to get a total document count in your index, or if you want to filter or facet over the complete set of documents, as described next.

**`search=*&filter=geo.distance(location,geography'POINT(-122.13+47.64)')+le+10`**
Geospatial search is supported through the [edm.GeographyPoint data type](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/supported-data-types) on a field containing coordinates. This query filters all results for positional data, where results are less than 10 kilometers from a given point (specified as latitude and longitude coordinates). Geosearch is supported through filters, specified in [Filter OData syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/odata-expression-syntax-for-azure-search). 

Normally, filter expressions are specified as $filter with a `$` character. In Search Explorer, you should omit the `$`.

Geospatial search is useful if your search application has a 'find near me' feature or uses map navigation. It is not full text search, however. If you have application requirements for searching on a city or country by name, add fields containing city or country names, in addition to coordinates.

## Next steps
After you run the wizard once, you can go back and view or modify individual components: index, indexer, or data source. Some edits, such as the changing the field data type, are not allowed on the index, but most properties and settings are modifiable. To view individual components, click the **Index**, **Indexer**, or **Data Sources** tiles on your dashboard to display a list of existing objects.

To learn more about index edits that do not require a rebuild, see [Update Index (Azure Search REST API)](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/update-index).

The sample dataset, `realestate-us-sample`, is from an Azure SQL Database that Azure Search can crawl. Besides Azure SQL Database, Azure Search can crawl Azure Table storage, Blob storage, SQL Server on an Azure VM, and DocumentDB. All of these data sources are supported in the wizard. In code, you can create and populate an index easily using an *indexer*.

All other data sources are supported via a push model, where your code pushes new and changed rowsets to your index. For more information, see [Add, update, or delete documents in Azure Search](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/addupdate-or-delete-documents).
