# Capacity planning in Azure Search

Scale-out becomes available at the Standard tier (both S1 and S2), where resource allocation is adjustable, scaling to whatever level you need. You can independently set the resource levels for partitions (to scale up storage) and replicas (to provide high availability and improved QPS and indexing performance).

Capacity in Azure Search is purchased in increments called search units. Standard allows for up to 36 search units per Search service. You have to choose a combination of partitions and replicas that stays below the 36 unit limit. For example, you couldn't scale your service up to 12 partitions and 6 replicas, because doing so would require 72 search units (12 x 6), exceeding the limit of 36 search units per service.

## About partitions and replicas

**Partitions** provide storage and IO. A single Search service can have a maximum of 12 partitions. Each partition comes with a hard limit of 15 million documents or 25 GB of storage, whichever comes first. If you add partitions, your Search service can load more documents. For example, a service with a single partition that initially stores up to 25 GB of data can store 50 GB when you add a second partition to the service.

**Replicas** are copies of the search engine. A single Search service can have a maximum of 6 replicas. You need at least 2 replicas for read (query) availability, and at least 3 replicas for read-write (query, indexing) availability.

A copy of each index runs on each replica. As you add replicas, additional copies of the index are brought online to support greater query workloads and to load balance the requests over the multiple replicas. If you have multiple indexes, say 6, and 3 replicas, each replica will have a copy of all 6 indexes.

Note that we provide no hard estimates on queries per second (QPS), as query execution can vary a lot depending on the complexity of the query and competing workloads. On average, a replica can service about 15 QPS, but your throughput will be somewhat higher or lower depending on query complexity (faceted queries are more complex) and network latency. Also, it's important to recognize that while adding replicas will definitely add scale and performance, the end result is not strictly linear: adding 3 replicas does not guarantee triple throughput. Query latency is an indicator that additional replicas might be needed.

## Supported combinations of partitions and replicas

The effective limit on partitions and replicas is based on the combination of resources you select, while staying within the boundary of 36 search units per service. Resources are allocated in terms of search units (SU). A dedicated Search service starts with one replica and one partition, as one search unit.

Additional capacity is calculated as partitions multiplied by replicas, yielding a total number of search units required to support a given configuration.

The following table is a chart that lists replicas on the vertical axis, and partitions on the horizontal axis. The intersection shows the number of search units required to support each combination, subject to the 36 search unit (SU) limit per service. For example, if you want 6 replicas and 2 partitions, this configuration would require 12 search units. To use 4 replicas and 2 partitions, you would need 8 search units. As a general rule, most search applications tend to need more replicas than partitions.

Search units, pricing, and capacity are explained in detail on the Azure web site. See [Pricing Details](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/search/) for more information.

> [AZURE.NOTE] The number of replicas and partitions must evenly divide into 12 (specifically, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12). This is because Azure Search pre-divides each index into 12 shards so that it can be spread across partitions. For example, if your service has three partitions and you create a new index, each partition will contain 4 shards of the index. How Azure Search shards an index is an implementation detail, subject to change in future release. Although the number is 12 today, you shouldn't expect that number to always be 12 in the future.

## Choose a combination of partitions and replicas for high availability

Because it's easy and relatively fast to scale up, we generally recommend that you start with one partition and one or two replicas, and then scale up as query volumes build. For many deployments,  one partition provides sufficient storage and IO (at 15 million documents per partition).

Query workloads, however, rely on replicas. You could require additional replicas if you need more throughput or high availability.

General recommendations for high availability are:

- 2 replicas for high availability of read-only workloads (queries)
- 3 or more replicas for high availability of read-write workloads (queries and indexing)

Currently, there is no built-in mechanism for disaster recovery. Adding partitions or replicas would be the wrong strategy for meeting disaster recovery objectives. Instead, you might consider adding redundancy at the service level. For a deeper discussion of the workarounds, see [this forum post](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/ee108a26-00c5-49f6-b1ff-64c66c8b828a/dr-and-high-availability-for-azure-search?forum=azuresearch).

> [AZURE.NOTE] Recall that service level agreements and scalability are features of the standard service. The free service is offered at a fixed resource level, with replicas and partitions shared by multiple subscribers. If you started with the free service and now want to upgrade, you will need to create a new Azure Search service at the standard level and then reload indexes and data to the new service. See [Create an Azure Search service in the portal](search-create-service-portal.md) for instructions on service provisioning.
