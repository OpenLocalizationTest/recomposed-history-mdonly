# Synonyms in Azure Search (preview)

Synonyms in search engines associate equivalent terms that implicitly expand the scope of a query, without the user having to actually provide the term. For example, given the term "dog" and synonym associations of "canine" and "puppy", any documents containing "dog", "canine" or "puppy" will fall within the scope of the query.

In Azure Search, synonyms are a query-time expansion. You can use it on existing indexes without having to rebuild them.

## Feature availability

Synonyms are currently in preview, and the feature is available only in the Service REST API (api-version=2015-02-28-Preview). There is no portal or .NET SDK support at this time. Because the REST API version is specified on the request, it's possible to combine generally available (GA) and preview APIs in the same app. However, preview APIs are not under SLA, so we do not recommend using them in production applications.

## How to use synonyms in Azure search

In Azure Search, synonym support is based on synonym maps that you define and upload to your service. These maps constitute an independent resource (like indexes or datasources), and can be used by any searchable field in any index in your search service.

Synonym maps and indexes are maintained independently. Once you define a synonym map and upload it to your service, you can enable the synonym feature on a field by adding a new property called **synonymMaps** in the field definition. Creating, updating, and deleting a synonym map is always a whole-document operation, meaning that you cannot create, update or delete parts of the synonym map incrementally. Updating even a single entry requires a reload.

Incorporating synonyms into your search application is a two-step process:

1.	Add a synonym map to your search service through the APIs below.  

2.	Configure a searchable field to use the synonym map in the index definition.

### SynonymMaps Resource APIs

#### Add or update a synonym map under your service, using POST or PUT.

Synonym configuration and its mappings, is uploaded to the service via POST or PUT. The request payload must be under 16 MB.

In this preview, only the 'solr' format is supported for synonym maps.`*` If you have an existing synonym dictionary in a different format and want to use it directly, please let us know on [UserVoice](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/263029-azure-search).

You can create a new synonym map using HTTP POST, as in the following example:

	POST https://[servicename].search.windows.net/synonymmaps/?api-version=2015-02-28-Preview
	api-key: [admin key]
	
	{  
	   "name":"mysynonymmap",
	   "format":"solr",
	   "synonyms": "
	      chair, armchair, rocker, recliner 
	      Washington, Wash., WA => WA
	      pet => cat, dog, puppy, kitten, pet"
	}

Alternatively, you can use PUT and specify the synonym map name on the URI. If the synonym map does not exist, it will be created. 

	PUT https://[servicename].search.windows.net/synonymmaps/mysynonymmap?api-version=2015-02-28-Preview
	api-key: [admin key]
	
    {  
       "format":"solr",
       "synonyms": "
          chair, armchair, rocker, recliner 
          Washington, Wash., WA => WA
          pet => cat, dog, puppy, kitten, pet"
    }

`*` The Solr format supports equivalent and explicit synonym mappings. Below is a sample rule for equivalent synonyms.   
```
              chair, armchair, rocker, recliner 
```

With the rule above, a search query "chair" will expand to "chair OR armchair OR rocker OR recliner". 

Explicit mapping is denoted by an arrow "=>". When specified, a token sequence of a search query that matches the left hand side of "=>" will be replaced with the alternatives on the right hand side. Given the rule below, a search query "Washington" will be replaced to "WA".
```
              Washington, Wash., WA => WA 
```

#### List synonym maps under your service.

	GET https://[servicename].search.windows.net/synonymmaps?api-version=2015-02-28-Preview
	api-key: [admin key]

#### Get a synonym map under your service.
		
	GET https://[servicename].search.windows.net/synonymmaps/mysynonymmap?api-version=2015-02-28-Preview
	api-key: [admin key]

#### Delete a synonyms map under your service.

	DELETE https://[servicename].search.windows.net/synonymmaps/mysynonymmap?api-version=2015-02-28-Preview
	api-key: [admin key]

### SynonymMaps property in the field definition

A new field property **synonymMaps** can be used to specify a synonym map to use for a searchable field. Multiple search indexes under a service can refer to the same synonym map.


	POST https://[servicename].search.windows.net/indexes?api-version=2015-02-28-Preview
	api-key: [admin key]
	
	{
	   "name":"myindex",
	   "fields":[
	      {
	         "name":"id",
	         "type":"Edm.String",
	         "key":true
	      },
	      {
	         "name":"name",
	         "type":"Edm.String",
	         "searchable":true,
	         "analyzer":"en.lucene",
	         "synonymMaps":[
	            "mysynonymmap"
	         ]
	      },
	      {
	         "name":"name_jp",
	         "type":"Edm.String",
	         "searchable":true,
	         "analyzer":"ja.lucene",
	         "synonymMaps":[
	            "japanesesynonymmap"
	         ]
	      }
	   ]
	}

**synonymMaps** can be specified for fields that meet the following criteria:

- Edm.String or Collection(Edm.String) 
- searchable:true
- analyzer: null (standard) | [Lucene Language analyzers](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn879793.aspx) `*`
- synonymMaps: `<a single synonym map on the same service as the index>` `**`

`*` Microsoft language analyzers and custom analyzers are unsupported for synonyms in this preview.

`**` In this preview, you can only have one synonym map per field. If you want to use multiple synonym maps, please let us know on [UserVoice](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/263029-azure-search).

## Impact of synonyms on other search features

A phrase is parsed as an OR'd construction. For this reason, hit highlighting and scoring profiles treat the original term and synonyms as equivalent.

In contrast, filters and facets are pegged to a static value, and would not factor synonyms into filters or a faceted navigation structure. Similarly, suggestions are based only on the original term; synonym matches do not appear in the response.

## Tips for building a synonym map

- A concise, well-designed synonym map is more efficient than an exhaustive list of possible matches. Excessively large or complex dictionaries take longer to scan and affect the query response time.  Rather than guess at which terms might be used, you can get the actual terms via a [search traffic analysis report](search-traffic-analytics.md) .

- As both a preliminary and validation exercise, enable and then use this report to precisely determine which terms will benefit from a synonym match, and then continue to use it as validation that your synonym map is producing a better outcome. In the predefined report, the tiles "Most common search queries" and "Zero-result search queries" will give you the necessary information.

- You can create multiple synonym maps for your search application (for example, by language if your application supports a bi-lingual customer base). Currently, a field can only use one of them. You can update a field's synonymMaps property at any time.

## Next Steps

- If you have an existing index in a development (non-production) environment, experiment with a small dictionary to see how the addition of synonyms changes the search experience, including impact on scoring profiles, hit highlighting, and suggestions.

- [Enable search traffic analytics](search-traffic-analytics.md) and use the predefined Power BI report to learn which terms are used the most, and which ones return zero documents. Armed with these insights, revise the dictionary to include synonyms for unproductive queries that should be resolving to documents in your index.
