# What is Azure Search?
Azure Search is a cloud search-as-a-service solution that delegates server and infrastructure management to Microsoft, leaving you with a ready-to-use service that you can populate with your data and then use to add search to your web or mobile application. Azure Search allows you to easily add a robust search experience to your applications using a simple [REST API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn798935.aspx) or [.NET SDK](search-howto-dotnet-sdk.md) without managing search infrastructure or becoming an expert in search.

## Feature summary

Embed a powerful search experience in your app or site using the capabilities described in this section.

### Full text search and text analysis

Queries can be formulated using the [simple query syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/simple-query-syntax-in-azure-search), which offers logical operators, phrase search operators, suffix operators, precedence operators. Additionally, the [Lucene query syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/lucene-query-syntax-in-azure-search) can enable fuzzy search, proximity search, term boosting, and regular expressions. Azure Search also supports [custom lexical analyzers](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/custom-analyzers-in-azure-search) to allow your application to handle complex search queries using phonetic matching and regular expressions.

### Language support

Azure Search supports lexical analyzers for [56 different languages](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/language-support). Using both Lucene analyzers and Microsoft analyzers (refined by years of natural language processing in Office and Bing), Azure Search can analyze text in your application's search box to intelligently handle language-specific linguistics including verb tenses, gender, irregular plural nouns (for example, 'mouse' vs. 'mice'), word de-compounding, word-breaking (for languages with no spaces), and more.

### Data integration

You can push JSON data structures to populate an Azure Search index. Additionally, for supported data sources, you can use [indexers](search-indexer-overview.md) to automatically crawl Azure SQL Database, Azure DocumentDB, or [Azure Blob storage](search-howto-indexing-azure-blob-storage.md) to sync your search index's content with your primary data store.

**Document cracking** enables [indexing of major file formats](search-howto-indexing-azure-blob-storage.md) including Microsoft Office, PDF, and HTML documents.

### Search experience

+ **Search suggestions** can be enabled for auto-completed search bars and type-ahead queries. [Actual documents in your index are suggested](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/suggesters) as users enter partial search input.

+ **Faceted navigation** is enabled through a [just a single query parameter](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/search/search-faceted-navigation). Azure Search returns a faceted navigation structure you can use as the code behind a categories list, for self-directed filtering (for example, to filter catalog items by price-range or brand).

+ **Filters** can be used to incorporate faceted navigation into your application's UI, enhance query formulation, and filter based on user- or developer-specified criteria. Create filters using the [OData syntax](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/odata-expression-syntax-for-azure-search).

+ **Hit highlighting** [applies visual formatting to a matching keyword in search results](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/Search-Documents). You can choose which fields return highlighted snippets.

+ **Simple scoring** is a key benefit of Azure Search. [Scoring profiles](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/add-scoring-profiles-to-a-search-index) are used to model relevance as a function of values in the documents themselves. For example, you might want newer products or discounted products to appear higher in the search results. You can also build scoring profiles using tags for personalized scoring based on customer search preferences you've tracked and stored separately.

+ **Sorting** is offered for multiple fields via the index schema and then toggled at query-time with a single search parameter.

+ **Paging** and throttling your search results is [straightforward with the finely tuned control](search-pagination-page-layout.md) that Azure Search offers over your search results.  

### Geosearch

Azure Search intelligently processes, filters, and displays geographic locations. It enables users to explore data based on the proximity of a search result to a specified location or based on a specific geographic region. This video explains how it works: [Channel 9: Azure Search and Geospatial data](https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Data-Exposed/Azure-Search-and-Geospatial-Data).

### Cloud service advantages

+ **High availability** ensures an extremely reliable search service experience. When scaled properly, [Azure Search offers a 99.9% SLA](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/search/v1_0/).

+ **Fully managed** as an end-to-end solution, Azure Search requires absolutely no infrastructure management. Your service can be tailored to your needs by scaling in two dimensions to handle more document storage, higher query loads, or both.

### Monitoring and reporting

+ **Search traffic analytics** are [collected and analyzed](search-traffic-analytics.md) to unlock insights from what users are typing into the search box.

+ Metrics on queries per second, latency, and throttling are captured and reported in portal pages with no additional configuration required. You can also easily monitor index and document counts so that you can adjust capacity as needed. 

### Tools for prototyping and inspection

In the portal, you can use the **Import data** wizard to configure indexers, index designer to stand up an index, and **Search explorer** to issue queries against all of your indexes right from your account's Azure portal so you can test queries and refine scoring profiles. You can also open any index to view its schema.

## How it works
### Step 1: Provision service
You can spin up an Azure Search service using either the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) or the [Azure Resource Management API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn832684.aspx).

Depending on how you configure the search service, you'll use either the free tier of service that is shared with other Azure Search subscribers, or a [paid tier](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/search/) that dedicates resources to be used only by your service. When provisioning your service, you also choose the region of the data center that hosts your service.

Depending on which tier of service you choose, you can scale your service in two dimensions: 1) Add Replicas to grow your capacity to handle heavy query loads and 2) add Partitions to add storage for more documents. By handling document storage and query throughput separately, you can customize your search service for your specific needs.

### Step 2: Create index
Before you can upload your content to your Azure Search service, you must first define an Azure Search index. An index is like a database table that holds your data and can accept search queries. You define the index schema to map to the structure of the documents you wish to search, similar to fields in a database.

The schema of these indexes can either be created in the Azure portal, or programmatically [using the .NET SDK](search-howto-dotnet-sdk.md) or [REST API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn798941.aspx). Once the index is defined, you can then upload your data to the Azure Search service where it is subsequently indexed.

### Step 3: Index data
Once you have defined the fields and attributes of your index, you're ready to upload your content into the index. You can use either a push or pull model to upload data to the index.

The pull model is provided through indexers that can be configured for on demand or scheduled updates (see [Indexer operations (Azure Search Service REST API)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn946891.aspx)), allowing you to easily ingest data and data changes from an Azure DocumentDB, Azure SQL Database, Azure Blob Storage, or SQL Server hosted in an Azure VM.

The push model is provided through the SDK or REST APIs, used for sending updated documents to an index. You can push data from virtually any dataset using the JSON format. See [Add, update, or delete Documents](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn798930.aspx) or [How to use the .NET SDK)](search-howto-dotnet-sdk.md) for guidance on loading data.

### Step 4: Search
Once you have populated your Azure Search index, you can now [issue search queries](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn798927.aspx) to your service endpoint using simple HTTP requests with REST API or the .NET SDK.

## How it compares

Customers often ask how Azure Search compares with full text search in their database product. Our response is that Azure Search language capabilities are richer and more flexible, with support for Lucene queries, custom analyzers, custom scoring, and the ability to merge data from multiple sources in the search index. Additionally, you might also need search experience features like filters, faceted navigation, hit highlighting, and typeahead query suggestions. For monitoring and insights into query input terms, Azure Search offers [search traffic analytics](search-traffic-analytics.md).

Another consideration is resource utilization. Natural language search is often computationally intensive. Some customers have moved their search operations from their database server to Azure Search to preserve resources for transaction processing. Furthermore, when you use a dedicated service like Azure Search, you can scale resources up or down to accommodate changes in query volume.

Once you've decided to offload search operations, your next decision is between a cloud service or an on-premises server. A cloud approach is the right choice if you want a [turn-key solution with minimal overhead and maintenance](#cloud-service-advantage).

Within the cloud service approach, several search providers offer comparable baseline features, with full-text search, geo-search, and the ability to handle a certain level of ambiguity in search inputs. Typically, it's a [specialized feature](#feature-drilldown), or the ease and overall simplicity of APIs, tools, and management that determines the best fit.

Among cloud service providers, Azure Search is strongest for full text search workloads over content stores and databases on Azure, with an additional layer of functionality necessary for apps that rely primarily on search for information retrieval and content navigation. Key strengths include:

+ Azure data integration (crawlers) at the indexing layer
+ Azure portal for central management
+ Azure scale, reliability, and world-class availability
+ Linguistic and custom analysis, with analyzers for solid full text search in 56 languages
+ Core features common to search-centric apps, including relevance, faceting, suggestions, synonyms, geo-search, and more (listed next).

> [!Note]
> Non-Azure data sources are fully supported, but rely on a push methodology instead of indexers. Using our APIs, you can pipe any JSON document collection to an Azure Search index.

Use cases able to leverage the widest range of features in Azure Search include online catalogs, line of business programs, and document discovery applications.

## REST API | .Net SDK

While a number of tasks can be performed in the portal, Azure Search is intended for developers who want to integrate search functionality into existing applications. The following programming interfaces are available.

|Platform |Description |
|-----|------------|
|[REST](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/) | HTTP commands supported by any programming platform and language, including Xamarin, Java, and JavaScript|
|[.NET SDK](search-howto-dotnet-sdk.md) | .NET wrapper for the REST API offers efficient coding in C# and other managed-code languages targeting the .NET Framework |

## Free trial
Azure subscribers can [provision a service in the Free tier](search-create-service-portal.md).
