# Choose a SKU or tier for Azure Search

Before you can [create a search service](search-create-service-portal.md) in Azure Search, you will need to decide which tier or SKU to provision the service at. SKUs include: Free, Basic, or Standard, where Standard is available in multiple resource configurations and capacities. 

Capacity and costs of running the service go hand-in-hand. Information in this article can help you decide which SKU delivers the right balance, but for any of it to be useful, you will need at least rough estimates on the number and size of indexes you plan to create, and some idea of how many queries per second you will need to accommodate. With estimates in hand, the following steps should make the SKU decision a little easier:

- **Step 1** Review the SKU descriptions below to become familiar with each one.
- **Step 2** Answer a series of questions to narrow down your choice.
- **Step 3** Validate the decision by reviewing hard limits on storage and pricing. 

## SKU descriptions

Tier|Key characteristics|Designed for
----|-----------|-----------
Free|Shared, at no charge|Evaluation, investigation, or small workloads. It has the lowest number of indexes (3) and documents (10,000) of all the tiers. Because it's shared with other subscribers,  query throughput and indexing will vary based on who else is using the service.
Basic|3 replicas and 1 partition|Small production workloads on dedicated hardware. Highly available for queries, but not index updates.
Standard 1 (S1)|Flexible combinations of partitions and replicas| Medium production workloads on dedicated hardware. You can allocate partitions and replicas in combinations supported by a maximum number of 36 billable search units. <br/><br/>Partitions are 25 GB each. Query throughput on replicas is about 15 queries per second on average.
Standard 2 (S2)|Same configurations, at more capacity|Larger production workloads. <br/><br/>Partitions are 100 GB each. Query throughput on replicas is about 60 queries per second on average.
Standard 3 (S3) Preview|Same configurations, at proportionally more capacity|Larger production workloads. <br/><br/>Partitions are 200 GB each. Query throughput on replicas is more than 60 queries per second on average.
Standard 3 High Density (S3 HD) Preview|12 replicas and 1 partition|Designed for customers who have a large number of smaller indexes.

## Decision path for choosing a SKU

Refer to this chart, which is a subset of the limits from [Service limits in Azure Search](search-limits-quotas-capacity.md), for the factors most likely to impact a SKU decision.

Resource|Free|Basic|S1|S2|S3 <br/>(Preview) |S3 HD <br/>(Preview) 
---|---|---|---|----|---|----
Service Level Agreement (SLA)|No <sup>1</sup> |Yes |Yes  |Yes |No <sup>1</sup> |No <sup>1</sup> 
Indexes allowed per SKU|3|5|50|200|200|1000
Maximum partitions|N/A |1 |12  |12 |12|1
Documents limits|10,000 total|1 million per service|15 million per partition |60 million per partition|120 million per partition |1 million per index
Partition size|50 MB total|2 GB per service|25 GB per partition |100 GB per partition (up to a maximum of 1.2 TB per service)|200 GB per partition (up to a maximum of 2.4 TB per service)|200 GB (for the 1 partition)
Maximum replicas|N/A |3 |12 |12 |12|12
Queries per second|N/A|~3 per replica|~15 per replica|~60 per replica|>60 per replica|>60 per replica

<sup>1</sup> Free and Preview SKUs do not come with SLAs. SLAs are enforced once a SKU becomes generally available.

> [AZURE.NOTE] Replica and partition maximums are subject a combined maximum billing configuration of 36 units, which imposes a lower effective limit than what the maximum implies at face value. For example, to use the maximum of 12 replicas, you could have at most 3 partitions (12 * 3 = 36 units). Similarly, to use maximum partitions, reduce replicas to 3. See [Scale resource levels for query and indexing workloads in Azure Search](search-capacity-planning.md) for a chart on allowable combinations.

### Review criteria for choosing a SKU

The following questions can help you arrive at the right SKU decision for your workload.

1. Do you have **Service Level Agreement (SLA)** requirements? Narrow the SKU decision to Basic or non-preview Standard.
2. Do you need **High availability**? High availability is built into every SKU if you configure multiple replicas. With two replicas you will get high availability for read operations. With three or more replicas you will get high availability for read and write operations.
3. **How many indexes** do you require? One of the biggest variables that will factor into a SKU decision is the number of indexes supported by each SKU.
4. **Number and size of documents** will determine the eventual size of the index. Assuming you can estimate the projected size of the index, you can compare that number against partition size per SKU, extended by the number of partitions required to store an index of that size.
5. Once storage requirements are understood, consider query workloads. S2 and both S3 SKUs offer near-equivalent throughput. Any SLA requirements will rule out the preview S3 SKU.

Most customers can rule specific SKUs in or out based on their answers to these 5 questions. If you still aren't sure which SKU to go with, contact Azure Support for further guidance.

## Decision validation: does the SKU offer sufficient storage and QPS

As a last step, revisit the [pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/search/) and the [per-service and per-index sections in Service Limits](search-limits-quotas-capacity.md) to double-check your estimates against subscription and service limits. 

If either the price or storage requirements are out of bounds, you might want to refactor the workloads among multiple smaller services (for example). On more granular level, you could redesign indexes to be smaller, or use filters to make queries more efficient.

> [AZURE.NOTE] Storage requirements can be over-inflated if documents contain extraneous data. Ideally, documents consist only of searchable data or metadata. Binary data that can bloat a document should be stored separately (perhaps in an Azure table or blob storage) with a field in the index to hold a URL reference to the external data. The maximum size of an individual document is 16 MB (or less if you are bulk uploading multiple documents in one request). See [Service limits in Azure Search](search-limits-quotas-capacity.md) for more information.
