# What is Azure Search?

Azure Search offers a dedicated and programmable search engine with intelligent search behaviors to power the search bar for content on your website, in your apps, and in corporate file or data stores. 

![Search bar powered by Azure Search](./media/search-what-is-azure-search/search-powered-by-azsearch3.png)

Full text search, auto-correct and auto-complete, synonyms and suggestions, boosting and tuned ranking, filtering and sorting, built-in navigation and paging support - these features contribute to an intuitive search experience typical of what users now expect, and are easy to implement using Azure Search.

## How it works

To use Azure Search, provision a free or paid service in your Azure subscription, create and load an index containing your searchable content, and then call APIs to issue search requests and handle results. A paid service is required if you want dedicated resources at scale.

|Tier |Description |
|-----|------------|
|[Free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) | A shared service that can be provisioned quickly and used small workloads, typical for learning and evaluation scenarios. |
|[Billable](search-sku-tier.md) | A dedicated service at graduated levels of capacity, from Basic to Standard, to Standard High Density; accommodating a range of deployment scenarios at different pricing tiers.|

Azure Search runs in the cloud as a managed service from Microsoft, and can be integrated with custom code on any application platform. Your fully managed service and private content is globally available, programmable, scalable, and recoverable. 

Highly available services run 24-7 at scale with [99.9% service level agreements backed by Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/search/v1_0/).

## How it compares

Several cloud service providers offer custom search engines with features that power a search bar in custom apps. 
Some offer comparable baseline features, with full-text search, geo-search, and the ability to handle a certain level of ambiguity in search inputs. Typically, it's a [specialized feature](#feature-drilldown), or the ease and overall simplicity of APIs, tools, and management that determines the best fit.

Key benefits unique to Azure Search include deep integration with other Azure services (especially at the data layer), level of control over searchable data, Microsoft expertise in hosting your service, tooling, and well-designed APIs that do exactly what you need. 

At the data layer, Azure Search provides automated indexing on Azure table storage, blob storage, DocumentDB, SQL Database, SQL Server on Azure VMs. You have full programmatic control over data ingestion. Synchronization between search and inventory databases, for example during Black Friday or Cyber Monday sales, is a business requirement that's not easily met by every vendor.

Developers already using other Azure services, such as App Service or Application Insights, find it easy to incrementally add additional capability like search into custom apps that leverage other services on Microsoft's cloud platform.

The Azure portal offers centralized oversight for all services. You can monitor and scale your service in the same tool used to manage all of your cloud services. In Azure Search, the portal includes an index designer, Import Data wizard, and Search Explorer. This enable fast prototyping, testing, and query validation without code.

> [!NOTE]
> It's common for a search technology to store searchable data in an index. On the surface, it looks like duplication of storage, but indexes are typically much smaller than the external data stores used by applications, storing only the fields and metadata directly applicable in a query operation. It is rare to store a fully redundant copy of existing data. Storing data with the service offers the most reliable and high-performance throughput, with no impact on transactional data stores.

#### Query syntax, parsing and analysis

Queries can be formulated using the [simple query syntax](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn798920.aspx), which offers logical operators, phrase search operators, suffix operators, precedence operators. Additionally, the [Lucene query syntax](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/mt589323.aspx) can enable fuzzy search, proximity search, term boosting, and regular expressions. Azure Search also supports [custom lexical analyzers](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/custom-analyzers-in-azure-search) to allow your application to handle complex search queries using phonetic matching and regular expressions.

#### Data integration

You can push any JSON data structure to an Azure Search index. Additionally, for supported data sources, you can use [indexers](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn946891.aspx) to automatically crawl Azure SQL Database, Azure DocumentDB, or [Azure Blob storage](search-howto-indexing-azure-blob-storage.md) to sync your search index's content with your primary data store.

**Document cracking** enables [indexing of major file formats](search-howto-indexing-azure-blob-storage.md) including Microsoft Office as well as PDF and HTML documents.

#### Language support

Azure Search supports language analyzers for [56 different languages](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn879793.aspx). Using both Lucene analyzers and Microsoft analyzers (refined by years of natural language processing in Office and Bing), Azure Search can analyze text in your application's search box to intelligently handle language-specific linguistics including verb tenses, gender, irregular plural nouns (for example, 'mouse' vs. 'mice'), word de-compounding, word-breaking (for languages with no spaces), and more.

#### Search experience

**Search suggestions** can be enabled for autocompleted search bars and type-ahead queries. [Actual documents in your index are suggested](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn798936.aspx) as users enter partial search input.

**Hit highlighting** [allows](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn798927.aspx) users to see the snippet of text in each result that contains the matches for their query. You can choose which fields return highlighted snippets.

**Faceted navigation** is easily added to your search results page with Azure Search. Using [just a single query parameter](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn798927.aspx), Azure Search returns all the necessary information to construct a faceted search experience in your app's UI to allow users to drill down and filter search results (for example, filter catalog items by price-range or brand).

**Filters** can be used to incorporate faceted navigation into your application's UI, enhance query formulation, and filter based on user- or developer-specified criteria. Create powerful filters using the [OData syntax](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn798921.aspx).

**Simple scoring** is a key benefit of Azure Search. [Scoring profiles](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn798928.aspx) are used to allow organizations to model relevance as a function of values in the documents themselves. For example, you might want newer products or discounted products to appear higher in the search results. You can also build scoring profiles using tags for personalized scoring based on customer search preferences you've tracked and stored separately.

**Sorting** is offered for multiple fields via the index schema and then toggled at query-time with a single search parameter.

**Paging** and throttling your search results is [straightforward with the finely tuned control](search-pagination-page-layout.md) that Azure Search offers over your search results.  

#### Geosearch

Azure Search intelligently processes, filters, and displays geographic locations. It enables users to explore data based on the proximity of a search result to a specified location or based on a specific geographic region. This video explains how it works: [Channel 9: Azure Search and Geospatial data](https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Data-Exposed/Azure-Search-and-Geospatial-Data).

#### Cloud service advantages

**High availability** ensures an extremely reliable search service experience. When scaled properly, [Azure Search offers a 99.9% SLA](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/search/v1_0/).

**Fully managed** as an end-to-end solution, Azure Search requires absolutely no infrastructure management. Your service can be tailored to your needs by scaling in two dimensions to handle more document storage, higher query loads, or both.

#### Reporting

**Search traffic analytics** are [collected and analyzed](search-traffic-analytics.md) to unlock insights from what users are typing into the search box.

### Tools for quick tasks and prototyping

In the portal, you can use the **Import data** wizard to configure indexers, index designer to stand up an index, and **Search explorer** to issue queries against all of your indexes right from your account's Azure portal so you can test queries and refine scoring profiles.

## How to get started

Start with a free service, and then create and query an index using sample built-in data. You can use the portal for all tasks, which is a quick way to try out Azure Search before having to write any code.

1. Azure subscribers can [provision a service in the Free tier](search-create-service-portal.md).

  If you aren't a subscriber, you can [open an Azure account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F): You get credits you can use to try out paid Azure services, and even after they're used up you can keep the account and use free Azure services, such as Websites. Your credit card will never be charged, unless you explicitly change your settings and ask to be charged.

  Alternatively, you can [activate MSDN subscriber benefits](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/member-offers/msdn-benefits-details/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F): Your MSDN subscription gives you credits every month that you can use for paid Azure services. 

2. Run the **Import data** wizard over the [built-in real estate sample dataset](search-get-started-portal.md).

  This wizard can generate an initial index from most support data sources, which you can use as-is or modify, and load its data.

3. Use Search Explorer to query the index.

### REST API | .Net SDK

While a number of tasks can be performed in the portal, Azure Search is intended for developers who want to integrate search functionality into existing applications. The following programming interfaces are available.

|Platform |Description |
|-----|------------|
|[REST](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/searchservice/) | HTTP commands supported by any programming platform and language, including Xamarin, Java, and JavaScript|
|[.NET SDK](search-howto-dotnet-sdk.md) | .NET wrapper for the REST API offers efficient coding in C# and other managed-code languages targeting the .NET Framework |
