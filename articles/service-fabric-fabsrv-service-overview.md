# FabSrv Programming Model Overview

The FabSrv programming model is one of the top level programming models available for Service Fabric, available alongside the FabAct programming model.

## Introduction

FabSrv provides a simplified programming model that provides a common model for writing new services, specifically:

1. A pluggable communication model - use the transport of your choice, like HTTP WebAPI, WebSockets, Custom TCP protocols, etc.

2. A simplified model for running your own code - compared to lower level Service Fabric abstractions the FabSrv model looks much like programming models that people are used: your code has a well defined entry point and easily managed lifecycle
