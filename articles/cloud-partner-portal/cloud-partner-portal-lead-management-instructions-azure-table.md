# Lead Management Instructions for Azure Table

This document provides you with instructions on how to setup your Azure Table so that Microsoft can provide you with sales leads. 

1. If you donâ€™t have an Azure account, then please first [go create one](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

2. Once your Azure account is ready, go log into the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and create a storage account. See screenshot below for instructions and go here to [learn more about storage pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/storage/). <br/>

You can use [Azure storage explorer](http://azurestorageexplorer.codeplex.com/) (third party app) or any other tool to see the data in your storage table or export the data.
