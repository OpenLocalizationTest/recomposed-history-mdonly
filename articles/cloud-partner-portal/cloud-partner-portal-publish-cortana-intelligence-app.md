# Publish a Cortana Intelligence app to AppSource?
Step by step guide for publishing a Cortana Intelligence or Microsoft R Services app on AppSource

## 1. Introduction

Thank you for your interest in publishing your Cortana Intelligence /
Microsoft R Solutions app to Microsoft AppSource. Microsoft is excited
to work with our dedicated partners (ISVs / SIs) to provide the premier
place for customers, resellers, and implementation partners to discover
and try business solutions and make the most of their investments. This
guide walks you through each of the steps to get your solution
published.

## 2. Getting started

Follow the instructions

1.  At [Starter Guide for getting showcased with
    Microsoft](https://www.microsoftpartnerserverandcloud.com/_layouts/download.aspx?SourceUrl=Hosted%20Documents/CESIPartnerJourneyOverview_1232017.pdf)
    to get listed as an Advanced Analytics partner.

2.  On AppSource by filling [List an
    app](https://appsource.microsoft.com/partners/list-an-app)
    form.
    - For the question *‚ÄúChoose the products that your app is built
    for*‚Äù, pick **Other** checkbox and list ‚ÄúCortana Intelligence‚Äù in
    edit control.

## 3. Solution evaluation criteria

Here is the list of criteria the app needs to meet

1.  App needs to address specific business use case problem within a
    given functional area in a repeatable manner. With minimal configurations/customizations, it should be able to deliver predefined value proposition within a short period of time.

2.  Solution should use at least one of the following analytics components

    1. HDInsight
    2. Machine Learning
    3. Data Lake Analytics
    4. Stream Analytics
    5. Cognitive Services
    6. Bot Framework
    7. Microsoft R Server stand-alone or R services on SQL 2016/HDInsight Premium

3.  Solution should be generating at least \$1 K / month / customer using
    Digital Partner Of Record (DPOR) or Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) programs.

4.  Solution should use Azure Active Directory federated single sign-on       (AAD federated SSO) with consent enabled for user authentication and      resource access controls. If your app is not already enabled, see

    1. [Getting started](https://identity.microsoft.com/)
    2. [Integrating applications with Azure Active Directory](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-integrating-applications#adding-an-application)

5.  Use Power BI in your solution and share is Power BI desktop file
    (PBIX): Optional but highly recommended as it is proven to generate
    higher number of leads

    1. Ensure all data is imported into the PBIX file
    2. No Externally Referenced Data ‚Äì we create the Embedded Report for you.

## 4. Decide on the type of offer you would like to publish on AppSource

AppSource enables partners to give two types of trial experiences to viewers
1.  Customer led trials, where customers can experience the app all by themselves
    1.  Free trial
        1.  AppSource navigates the user to a URL that you (partner) provide taking the user through AAD federated SSO and provide a time boxed trial experience.
        2.  Expectation here is that your app is a SaaS app with multi-tenancy support to isolate one user‚Äôs config/data from other OR the trial experience only gives a subset experience needing only read-only operations.

        Example : See [AFS POP Retail Execution](https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/web-apps/afs.fa9fc926-3bc3-43dd-becd-3ef41b52c10b?tab=Overview), [AvePoint Citizen Services](https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/web-apps/avepoint.7738ac97-fd40-4ed3-aaab-327c3e0fe0b3?tab=Overview) (this app provides a curated experience with clear paths for selected set of user personas) etc.
    2.  Test Drive
        1.  Your (partner) solution or a subset of it can be packaged using Azure Resource Manager templates that AppSource can instantiate and manage in partner Azure subscription with time boxing and maintaining hot/cold pool of instances etc.
        2.  We can provide templates and sample code to help you if you choose to go with this route.
        
        Example: See Neal Analytics [Inventory Optimization](https://appsource.microsoft.com/product/web-apps/neal_analytics.8066ad01-1e61-40cd-bd33-9b86c65fa73a?tab=Overview&tag=CISHome).

2.	Partner led trials, which require customers to fill a contact info form so that partner can follow up and give a demo/trial etc.

See [AppSource trial experience walkthrough](http://aka.ms/trialexperienceforwebapps) video for a high-level overview.

Data clearly shows that customer led trials have a high lead generation potential when compared to partner led trials ‚Äì think about it, who likes to fill out forms üòä

Decide which type of offer you would want to add to AppSource.

## 5. Getting approved to use Azure Marketplace publishing portal

As of now AAD/MSA email IDs need to be approved before you can access
the Azure Marketplace Publishing Portal to start publishing. Kindly
share the following details to
[appsourcecissupport@microsoft.com](mailto:appsourcecissupport@microsoft.com?subject=Request%20publisher%20account%20creation%20for%20%3cPartner%20Name%3e%20and%20whitelist%20owner/contributer%20AAD/MSA%20email%20IDs)

-   Publisher Display Name: &lt;Name of the firm as it shows up on
    AppSource as app‚Äôs publisher&gt;

-   Publisher Unique Name: &lt;unique name using only lower case chars
    and hyphen ‚Äò-‚Äò&gt;

-   WebSite: &lt;Firm‚Äôs Website&gt;

-   Owner Email: &lt;AAD/MSA email ID&gt;

-   Contributor2 Email: &lt;AAD/MSA email ID&gt;

 Add more contributors if you need.

## 6. Get info about your company‚Äôs lead management

As visitor‚Äôs express interest in solutions, these leads are passed
directly into partner‚Äôs lead management systems. AppSource supports multiple types of lead management systems (Dynamics CRM, Salesforce, Marketo etc.).

See [AppSource Marketing Lead Management](./cloud-partner-portal-marketing-lead-management.md) for details of the overall process and how can you find the right info to setup AppSource's leads.

        You can you any screen recording tool that exports a standard video
        format (for example, MPEG) can be used to prepare your demo video. Here are
        the instructions if you have Skype for Business
