# What products can be published via the Cloud Partner Portal

The Cloud Partner Portal is your hub for publishing your Azure Certified Virtual Machine (VM) image to Microsoft Azure Marketplace or your Cortana Intelligence/Microsoft R Solutions application to Microsoft AppSource.  

VM images are pre-configured images with a fully installed operating system and one or more applications. In order to publish your virtual machine image to Azure Marketplace, you must meet the [technical pre-requisites](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/marketplace-publishing/marketplace-publishing-vm-image-creation-prerequisites) to certify your image.
