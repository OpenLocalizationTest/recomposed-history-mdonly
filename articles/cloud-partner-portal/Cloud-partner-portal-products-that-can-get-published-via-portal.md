# What products can be published via the Cloud Partner Portal

The Cloud Partner Portal is your hub for publishing your Azure Certified Virtual Machine (VM) image to Microsoft Azure Marketplace or your Cortana Intelligence/Microsoft R Solutions application to Microsoft AppSource.  

VM images are pre-configured images with a fully installed operating system and one or more applications. In order to publish your virtual machine image to Azure Marketplace, you must meet the technical pre-requisites to certify your image.

Cortana Intelligence/Microsoft R Solutions applications are preconfigured applications that integrate with PowerBI to enable data analysis. In order to publish your application on AppSource, you must meet the app listing criteria.

##How to publish your Virtual Machine image 
The process of listing your Azure Certified virtual machine image on Azure Marketplace is called 'publishing' and the first time publishing  process is called, 'Onboarding'.  There are 5 steps involved in Onboarding, but first you need to meet some pre-requisites: 

##Prerequisites to listing on Azure Marketplace   
 
###Technical: 
•	Must have Azure compatible VM

###Business:
•	Must be based or have a subsidiary location in the approved 'Sell From' countries 
•	Must align with our supported  billing models
•	Must offer technical support to customers
•	Must agree to terms and participation policies
•	Must have English language marketing content
 
Assuming you have met the pre-requisites, you can begin the Onboarding process.
<<insert flow diagram for Apply, Register, Create, Certify, Publish>>
1.	Apply to publish on Azure Marketplace
2.	Register as a Developer on Developer Central
3.	Create your offer in the Cloud Partner Portal
4.	Certify your virtual machine image in Staging
5.	Publish your offer in Production

>The 5-step Onboarding process typically takes 4-6 weeks. In order to minimize the amount of time it takes to publish your offer, you should utilize these tools to build and pre-certify your VM. 

Let's get started with the Onboarding process:

###Step 1: Apply here
 
Once you've submitted the application form, you will hear back from the Azure Marketplace team within 3 business days with your approval status.  If you are approved, you will be contacted via email by the Azure Marketplace Onboarding team to start the remaining steps of the Onboarding process. This email will contain the following:
 
•	Promo code waiving the $99 application fee for Dev Center, where you will complete Registration (Step 2)

•	Login details for Cloud Partner Portal

•	Overview of publishing process 

•	Offer for call with Onboarding team to go through process and answer any questions
 
You can choose to wait until you speak with the Onboarding team to get started with publishing your offer, or you can go ahead and move forward on your own - it's entirely up to you. All the documentation you will need to publish is here, but we will be available to guide you through this process.
 
###Step 2: Register by submitting your Dev Center application 
>[!NOTE]
>Approval and background check can take up to 2 weeks. 
 
While you are waiting for approval in Developer Center, you can create your Azure Marketplace offer in the CPP cloud partner portal (Step 3) and certify your VM image in Staging (Step 4), but you *must* complete Registration (Step 2) to publish your offer to production and be live on Azure Marketplace .
