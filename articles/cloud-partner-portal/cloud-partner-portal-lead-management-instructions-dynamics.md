This role is created by the solution that you imported and has permissions to only write the leads and to know solution version for ensuring compatibility.

While in Security, select Security Roles and find the role for Microsoft Marketplace Lead Writer, choose that role and change the setting for create/read/write for the User Entity UI Settings in the Core Records tab shown below: <br/>
