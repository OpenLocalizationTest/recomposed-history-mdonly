# Feedback: Marketplace publishing and Cloud partner portal

Microsoft wants to make the Azure Marketplace, the AppSource publishing process, and the overall cloud partner portal experience as easy and as intuitive as possible. Weâ€™re looking to you to let us know if we hit the mark or if we have things to work on. We promise to triage and review all partner feedback, and we would like to contact you regarding your feedback. We respect your privacy and we will only reach out to you regarding your feedback. 

If you need immediate help, please contact [support](https://aka.ms/cloudpartnerportalsupport).

To let us know what you think, sign in to the [Cloud Partner Portal](https://cloudpartner.azure.com/) and click the smiley face in the top menu bar.
