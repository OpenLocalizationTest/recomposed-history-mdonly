# What is the Cloud Partner Portal?
The Cloud Partner Portal enables independent software vendor (ISV) partners to publish and offer their solution on the Microsoft cloud. If you are an ISV building a product targeting business users on [AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/), or developer and IT professionals on [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/), then the Cloud Partner Portal is the place for your solution.

As an Azure publisher, the Azure Marketplace is how you can distribute and sell your innovative solution or service to other developers, ISVs, and IT professionals who want to quickly develop their cloud-based applications and mobile solutions. And with AppSource, customers can find new line-of-business apps for their industry—plus apps that help them do more with the solutions they already use. Publishing your app allows you to reach new customers seeking better ways to run their business.

If you are a new ISV and haven’t done so already, go ahead and
- [Submit your app on Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/sell) if your solution is for developers and IT professionals. 
- [Submit your app on AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/partners) if your solution targets business users. 

Once your application is approved to onboard your solution, you will receive an invitation email from us to visit the [Cloud Partner Portal](https://cloudpartner.azure.com/) and get started.

### How the publishing process works
The Cloud Partner Portal, makes it as easy as possible to take your pre-built solution and list it onto the Marketplace. It’s important to call out that we highly recommend you build your complete solution before coming to the publishing process, as it simplifies the work required and allows you to make your solution available faster.

1.	To **build** a new offer you choose your type of product and construct an offer by adding technical and marketing information.
2.	Next **publish** your offer, which will submit the offer to get certified and approved for the Marketplace. Before you go live, you can preview to see exactly how it will look and feel inside the Marketplace.
3.	Once you submit your offer to go live on the Marketplace, your journey is just beginning. We've enabled you to **grow** your business by sending customer leads and sharing insights to how your offer is doing, so that you can build your business successfully with Microsoft.
