# Create and mount a file share to a DC/OS cluster
In this article, we'll explore how to create a file share on Azure and mount it on each agent and master of the DC/OS cluster. Setting up a file share makes it easier to share files across your cluster such as configuration, access, logs, and more. The following task are completed in this tutorial:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create storage account and file share
> * Mount the share in the DC/OS cluster

This tutorial requires the Azure CLI version 2.0.4 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI 2.0]( /cli/azure/install-azure-cli). 

You will need an ACS DC/OS cluster to complete the steps in this tutorial. If needed, [this script sample](./scripts/container-service-cli-deploy-dcos.md) can create one for you.

## Create a file share on Microsoft Azure

```azurecli
# Change these four parameters
DCOS_PERS_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME=mystorageaccount$RANDOM
DCOS_PERS_RESOURCE_GROUP=myResourceGroup
DCOS_PERS_LOCATION=eastus
DCOS_PERS_SHARE_NAME=dcosshare

# Create the storage account with the parameters
az storage account create -n $DCOS_PERS_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME -g $DCOS_PERS_RESOURCE_GROUP -l $DCOS_PERS_LOCATION --sku Standard_LRS

# Export the connection string as an environment variable, this is used when creating the Azure file share
export AZURE_STORAGE_CONNECTION_STRING=`az storage account show-connection-string -n $DCOS_PERS_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME -g $DCOS_PERS_RESOURCE_GROUP -o tsv`

# Create the share
az storage share create -n $DCOS_PERS_SHARE_NAME
```

## Mount the share in your cluster

Next, we need to mount this share on every virtual machine inside your cluster using the cifs tool/protocol. This can be completed manually on each node of the cluster, or by running a script from the DC/OS master. This example will demonstrate the scripted configuration. 

Create an SSH connection with the DC/OS master.

```bash
ssh azureuser@masterFQDN –A –p 22
```

### Set up scripts

1. First, SSH to the master (or the first master) of your DC/OS-based cluster. For example, `ssh userName@masterFQDN`, where the masterFQDN is the fully qualified domain name of the master VM.

2. Copy your private key to the working directory (~) on master.

3. Change the permissions on it with the following command: `chmod 600 yourPrivateKeyFile`.

4. Import your private key using the `ssh-add yourPrivateKeyFile` command. You may have to run `eval 'ssh-agent -s'` if it doesn't work the first time.

5. Create a file named **cifsMount.sh** and copy the following contents into it. This script will be used to mount the Azure file share in each node of the cluster. Update the variables with the correct information.   

  ```bash
  #!/bin/bash

  # Azure storage account name and access key
  STORAGE_ACCT_NAME=mystorageaccount29940
  ACCESS_KEY=3DogvPcYxEaa/OPyGw5lVJgmIxQzYPsgkjhowBFUKpBxMUHZl0GUcPPLthIEkYDqzSBgVgL01wFE9K3cUxhPYQ==

  # Install the cifs utils, should be already installed
  sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get -y install cifs-utils

  # Create the local folder that will contain our share
  if [ ! -d "/mnt/share/dcosshare" ]; then sudo mkdir -p "/mnt/share/dcosshare" ; fi

  # Mount the share under the previous local folder created
  sudo mount -t cifs //$STORAGE_ACCT_NAME.file.core.windows.net/dcosshare /mnt/share/dcosshare -o vers=3.0,username=$STORAGE_ACCT_NAME,password=$ACCESS_KEY,dir_mode=0777,file_mode=0777
  ```

6. Create a second file named **mountShares.sh** and copy the following contents into the file. This script will discover all cluster nodes and run the script to mount the Azure file share on them. Update the variables with the correct information.   

   ```bash
  #!/bin/bash

  # Azure storage account name and access key
  STORAGE_ACCT_NAME=mystorageaccount29940
  ACCESS_KEY=3DogvPcYxEaa/OPyGw5lVJgmIxQzYPsgkjhowBFUKpBxMUHZl0GUcPPLthIEkYDqzSBgVgL01wFE9K3cUxhPYQ==

  # Install jq used for the next command
  sudo apt-get install jq

  # Create the local folder that will contain our share
  if [ ! -d "/mnt/share/demoshare" ]; then sudo mkdir -p "/mnt/share/demoshare" ; fi

  # Mount the share on the current vm (master)
  sudo mount -t cifs //$STORAGE_ACCT_NAME.file.core.windows.net/dcosshare /mnt/share/dcosshare -o vers=3.0,username=$STORAGE_ACCT_NAME,password=$ACCESS_KEY,dir_mode=0777,file_mode=0777

  # Get the IP address of each node using the mesos API and store it inside a file called nodes
  curl http://leader.mesos:1050/system/health/v1/nodes | jq '.nodes[].host_ip' | sed 's/\"//g' | sed '/172/d' > nodes
    
  # From the previous file created, run our script to mount our share on each node
  cat nodes | while read line
    do
      ssh `whoami`@$line -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -i yourPrivateKeyFile < ./cifsMount.sh
      done
  ```  

### Run the scripts

Execute the **mountShares.sh** file with the following command: `sh mountShares.sh`.

> [!NOTE] 
> This method is not recommended for scenarios that require high IOPS, but it is very useful to share documents and information across the cluster.
