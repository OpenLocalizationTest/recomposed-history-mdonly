# Deploy a Kubernetes cluster in Azure Container Service

Kubernetes provides a distributed platform for running modern and containerized applications. With Azure Container Service, provisioning of a production ready Kubernetes cluster is simple and quick. This quick start details basic steps needed to deploy a Kubernetes cluster. Steps completed include:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Deploying a Kubernetes ACS cluster
> * Installation of the Kubernetes CLI (kubectl)
> * Configuration of kubectl

## Before you begin

In previous tutorials, container images were created and uploaded to an Azure Container Registry instance. If you have not done these steps, and would like to follow along, return to [Tutorial 1 â€“ Create container images](./container-service-tutorial-kubernetes-prepare-app.md). 

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, this tutorial requires that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.0.4 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI 2.0]( /cli/azure/install-azure-cli). 

## Create Kubernetes cluster

In the [previous tutorial](./container-service-tutorial-kubernetes-prepare-acr.md), a resource group named *myResourceGroup* was created. If you have not done so, create this resource group now.

```azurecli-interactive
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus
```

Create a Kubernetes cluster in Azure Container Service with the [az acs create](/cli/azure/acs#create) command. 

The following example creates a cluster named *myK8sCluster* with one Linux master node and three Linux agent nodes. If they do not already exist, SSH keys are created. To use a specific set of keys in a non-default location, use the `--ssh-key-value` option.

```azurecli-interactive 
az acs create --orchestrator-type=kubernetes --resource-group myResourceGroup --name=myK8SCluster --generate-ssh-keys 
```

After several minutes, the command completes, and returns information about the ACS deployment.

## Install the kubectl CLI

To connect to the Kubernetes cluster from your client computer, use [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/kubectl/), the Kubernetes command-line client. 

If you're using Azure CloudShell, `kubectl` is already installed. If you want to install it locally, use the [az acs kubernetes install-cli](/cli/azure/acs/kubernetes#install-cli) command.

If running in Linux or macOS, you may need to run with sudo. On Windows, ensure your shell has been run as administrator.

```azurecli-interactive 
az acs kubernetes install-cli 
```

On Windows, the default installation is *c:\program files (x86)\kubectl.exe*. You may need to add this file to the Windows path. 

## Connect with kubectl

To configure `kubectl` to connect to your Kubernetes cluster, run the [az acs kubernetes get-credentials](/cli/azure/acs/kubernetes#get-credentials) command.

```azurecli-interactive 
az acs kubernetes get-credentials --resource-group=myResourceGroup --name=myK8SCluster
```

To verify the connection to your cluster, run the [kubectl get nodes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/kubectl/v1.6/#get) command.

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

Output:

```bash
NAME                    STATUS                     AGE       VERSION
k8s-agent-98dc3136-0    Ready                      5m        v1.6.2
k8s-agent-98dc3136-1    Ready                      5m        v1.6.2
k8s-agent-98dc3136-2    Ready                      5m        v1.6.2
k8s-master-98dc3136-0   Ready,SchedulingDisabled   5m        v1.6.2
```

At tutorial competition, you have an ACS Kubernetes cluster ready for workloads. In subsequent tutorials, a multi-container application is deployed to this cluster, scaled out, updated, and monitored.

## Next steps

In this tutorial, an Azure Container Service Kubernetes cluster was deployed. The following steps were completed:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Deploying a Kubernetes ACS cluster
> * Installation of the Kubernetes CLI (kubectl)
> * Configuration of kubectl

Advance to the next tutorial to learn about running application on the cluster.
