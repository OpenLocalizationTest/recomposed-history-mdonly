# Connecting to an ACS Cluster

The Mesos and Swarm clusters deployed by Azure Container Service expose REST endpoints, however these endpoints are not open to the outside world. In order to manage these endpoints, an SSH tunnel must be created. Once an SSH tunnel has been established, you can run commands against the cluster endpoints and view the cluster UI through a browser on your own system. This document will walk through creating an SSH tunnel from Linux, OSX, and Windows.

**NOTE** - you can create an SSH session with a cluster management system, however this is not recommended. Working directly on a management system exposes risk for inadvertent configuration change.   

## SSH on Linux and OSX

First thing is to locate the public DNS name of load balanced masters. To do this, expand the resource group such that each resource is being displayed. Locate and select the public IP address of the master. This will open up a blade containing information about the public IP address, which will include the DNS name. Save this name for later use.

Now open a shell and run the following command where:

**PORT** is the port of the endpoint you want to expose.  
**USERNAME** is the username provided when you deployed the cluster.  
**DNSPREFIX** is the DNS prefix you provided when you deployed the cluster.  
**REGION** is the region in which your resource group is located.  
**SSH_PORT** is either 2200, 2201 … 2204 for master0, master1 … master4 REST API's respectively.  


```
ssh -L PORT:localhost:PORT -N [USERNAME]@[DNSPREFIX]man.[REGION].cloudapp.azure.com -p SSH_PORT
```

An example of this would look similar to the following.

```
ssh -L 8080:localhost:8080 -n azureuser@acsexamplemgmt.japaneast.cloudapp.azure.com -p 2200
```

The Mesos endpoint and UI can now be accessed at `http://localhost:5050` and the Marathon endpoint and UI can be accessed at `http://localhost:8080`.

## SSH Tunnel on Windows

Multiple options are available for creating SSH tunnels on Windows, this document will detail using Putty.

Download Putty to your Windows system and run the application.

Enter a host name that is comprised of the clusters admin user name and the public DNS name of the first master in the cluster. The Host Name will look like this, `adminuser@PublicDNS`. Enter 2200 for the Port.

Select `SSH` and `Authentication`, add your private key file for authentication.

Select `Tunnels` and `configure` the following forwarded ports:
- **Source Port:** 5050
- **Destination:** Master VM Name:5050 – the VM name can be found in Azure 

- **Source Port:** 8080
- **Destination:** Master VM Name:8080 – the VM name can be found in Azure

When complete, save the connection configuration, and connect the putty session. When connected, the port configuration can be seen in the Putty event log.

The Mesos endpoint and UI can now be accessed at `http://localhost:5050` and the Marathon endpoint and UI can be accessed at `http://localhost:8080`.
