# Connecting to an ACS Cluster

The Mesos and Swarm clusters deployed by Azure Container Service expose REST endpoints, however these endpoints are not open to the outside world. In order to manage these endpoints an SSH tunnel must be created. Once an SSH tunnel has been established you can run commands against the cluster endpoints, and view the cluster UI through a browser on your own system. This document will walk through creating an SSH tunnel from Windows, Linux and OSX.

**NOTE** - you can create an SSH session with a cluster management system, however this is not recommended. Working directly on a management system exposes some risk for inadvertent configuration change.   

## SSH Tunnel on Linux

```
ssh -L PORT:localhost:PORT -N [USERNAME]@[DNSPREFIX]man.[REGION].cloudapp.azure.com -p SSH_PORT
```

**PORT** is the port of the endpoint you want to expose.
**USERNAME** is the username provided when you deployed the cluster
**DNSPREFIX** is the DNS prefix you provided when you deployed the cluster
**REGION** is the region in which your resource group is located
**SSH_PORT** is either 22 (for the Jumpbox) or 2200, 2201 … 2204 for master0, master1 … master4 REST API's respectively

Now you can use the Marathon API on \[DNSPREFIX\]man.\[REGION\].cloudapp.azure.com using ```localhost:8080```

For example, to set up a tunnel to the Marathon API in our example cluster:

```
ssh -L 8080:localhost:8080 -n azureuser@acsexamplemgmt.japaneast.cloudapp.azure.com -p 2200
```
Now you can use the Marathon API on \[DNSPREFIX\]man.\[REGION\].cloudapp.azure.com using ```localhost:8080```

## SSH Tunnel on OSX

```
ssh -L PORT:localhost:PORT -N [USERNAME]@[DNSPREFIX]man.[REGION].cloudapp.azure.com -p SSH_PORT
```

**PORT** is the port of the endpoint you want to expose.
**USERNAME** is the username provided when you deployed the cluster
**DNSPREFIX** is the DNS prefix you provided when you deployed the cluster
**REGION** is the region in which your resource group is located
**SSH_PORT** is either 22 (for the Jumpbox) or 2200, 2201 … 2204 for master0, master1 … master4 REST API's respectively

Now you can use the Marathon API on \[DNSPREFIX\]man.\[REGION\].cloudapp.azure.com using ```localhost:8080```

For example, to set up a tunnel to the Marathon API in our example cluster:

```
ssh -L 8080:localhost:8080 -n azureuser@acsexamplemgmt.japaneast.cloudapp.azure.com -p 2200
```

## SSH Tunnel on Windows

Multiple options are available for creating SSH tunnels on Windows, this document will detail using Putty.

Download Putty to your Windows and open it up.

Enter your connection information.

Select SSH and Authentication and add your private key file for authentication.
