# Get started with a Kubernetes cluster in Container Service


This walkthrough shows you how to use the Azure CLI 2.0 commands to create a Kubernetes cluster in Azure Container Service. Then, you can use the `kubectl` command-line tool to start working with containers in the cluster.

The following image shows the architecture of a Container Service cluster with one master and two agents. The master serves the Kubernetes REST API. The agent nodes are grouped in an Azure availability set
and run your containers. All VMs are in the same private virtual network and are fully accessible to each other.

## Prerequisites
To create an Azure Container Service cluster using the Azure CLI 2.0, you must:
* have an Azure account ([get a free trial](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/))
* have installed and set up the [Azure CLI 2.0](/cli/azure/install-az-cli2)

Additionally, you need (or you can use the Azure CLI to generate automatically during cluster deployment):

* **SSH RSA public key**: If you want to create Secure Shell (SSH) RSA keys, see the [macOS and Linux](../virtual-machines/linux/mac-create-ssh-keys.md) or [Windows](../virtual-machines/linux/ssh-from-windows.md) guidance. 

* **Service principal client ID and secret**: If you want to create an Azure Active Directory service principal for Kubernetes, see [About the service principal for a Kubernetes cluster](container-service-kubernetes-service-principal.md).

  > [!IMPORTANT]
  > Whether the service principal for the Kubernetes cluster is created in advance by you or by the CLI during cluster deployment, you must have permissions to register an application with your Azure AD tenant, and to assign the application to a role in your Azure subscription. You can [check in the portal](../azure-resource-manager/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal.md#required-permissions) to see if you have the required permissions.  
  >


## Create your Kubernetes cluster

Here are brief shell commands that use the Azure CLI 2.0 to create your cluster. 

### Create a resource group
To create your cluster, you first need to create a resource group in a specific location. Run commands similar to the following:

```azurecli
RESOURCE_GROUP=my-resource-group
LOCATION=westus
az group create --name=$RESOURCE_GROUP --location=$LOCATION
```

### Create a cluster
Once you have a resource group, you can create a Kubernetes cluster in that group by using `az acs create` command and specifying `--orchestrator-type=kubernetes`. Here are a couple of ways to run the command.

### Example 1: Automatically generate SSH keys and service principal
The following example uses the `--generate-ssh-keys` option, which generates the necessary SSH public and private key files for the deployment if they don't exist already in the default `~/.ssh/` directory. 

This version of the command also automatically generates the [Azure Active Directory service principal](container-service-kubernetes-service-principal.md) needed for a Kubernetes cluster in Azure. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If your account doesn't have permissions to create the Azure AD service principal, the command generates an error similar to `Insufficient privileges to complete the operation.`   
> 

```azurecli
DNS_PREFIX=some-unique-value
CLUSTER_NAME=any-acs-cluster-name
az acs create --orchestrator-type=kubernetes --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name=$CLUSTER_NAME --dns-prefix=$DNS_PREFIX --generate-ssh-keys
```

### Example 2: Pass existing SSH key and service principal

The following example uses an existing SSH RSA public key file `id_rsa.pub` stored in the default `~/.ssh/` directory, and also passes the client ID and secret (password) of an existing [Azure Active Directory service principal](container-service-kubernetes-service-principal.md). In this case, you or your subscription administrator must previously have created the service principal with the required scope and role.


```azurecli
DNS_PREFIX=some-unique-value
CLUSTER_NAME=any-acs-cluster-name
CLIENT_ID=your-SP-id
CLIENT_SECRET=your-SP-password
az acs create --orchestrator-type=kubernetes --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name=$CLUSTER_NAME --dns-prefix=$DNS_PREFIX --service-principal $CLIENT_ID --client-secret $CLIENT_SECRET
```


After several minutes, the command completes, and you should have a working Kubernetes cluster.

### Connect to the cluster

To connect to the Kubernetes cluster from your client computer, you use [`kubectl`](https://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/kubectl/), the Kubernetes command-line client. 

If you don't already have `kubectl` installed, you can install it with:

```azurecli
sudo az acs kubernetes install-cli
```
> [!TIP]
> By default, this command installs the `kubectl` binary to `/usr/local/bin/kubectl` on a Linux or macOS system, or to `C:\Program Files (x86)\kubectl.exe` on Windows. To specify a different installation path, use the `--install-location` parameter.
>

After `kubectl` is installed, ensure that its directory in your system path, or add it to the path. 


Then, run the following command to download the master Kubernetes cluster configuration to the `~/.kube/config` file:

```azurecli
az acs kubernetes get-credentials --resource-group=$RESOURCE_GROUP --name=$CLUSTER_NAME
```

For more options to install and configure `kubectl`, see [Connect to an Azure Container Service cluster](container-service-connect.md).

At this point you should be ready to access your cluster from your machine. Try running:

```bash
kubectl get nodes
```

Verify that you can see a list of the machines in your cluster.

## Create your first Kubernetes service

After completing this walkthrough, you will know how to:
* deploy a Docker application and expose it to the world
* use `kubectl exec` to run commands in a container 
* access the Kubernetes dashboard

### Start a simple container
You can run a simple container (in this case the Nginx web server) by running:

```bash
kubectl run nginx --image nginx
```

This command starts the Nginx Docker container in a pod on one of the nodes.

To see the running container, run:

```bash
kubectl get pods
```

### Expose the service to the world
To expose the service to the world, create a Kubernetes `Service` of type `LoadBalancer`:

```bash
kubectl expose deployments nginx --port=80 --type=LoadBalancer
```

This command causes Kubernetes to create an Azure load balancer rule with a public IP address. The change
takes a few minutes to propagate to the load balancer. For more information, see [Load balance containers in a Kubernetes cluster in Azure Container Service](container-service-kubernetes-load-balancing.md).

Run the following command to watch the service change from `pending` to display an external IP address:

```bash
watch 'kubectl get svc'
```

  ![Image of watching the transition from pending to external IP address](media/container-service-kubernetes-walkthrough/kubernetes-nginx3.png)

Once you see the external IP address, you can browse to it in your browser:

  ![Image of browsing to Nginx](media/container-service-kubernetes-walkthrough/kubernetes-nginx4.png)  


### Browse the Kubernetes UI
To see the Kubernetes web interface, you can use:

```bash
kubectl proxy
```
This command runs a simple authenticated proxy on localhost, which you can use to view the Kubernetes web UI running on [http://localhost:8001/ui](http://localhost:8001/ui). For more information, see [Using the Kubernetes web UI with Azure Container Service](container-service-kubernetes-ui.md).

![Image of Kubernetes dashboard](media/container-service-kubernetes-walkthrough/kubernetes-dashboard.png)

### Remote sessions inside your containers
Kubernetes allows you to run commands in a remote Docker container running in your cluster.

```bash
# Get the name of your nginx pods
kubectl get pods
```

Using your pod name, you can run a remote command on your pod.  For example:

```bash
kubectl exec <pod name> date
```

You can also get a fully interactive session using the `-it` flags:

```bash
kubectl exec <pod name> -it bash
```
