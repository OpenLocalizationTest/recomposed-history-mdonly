# Get started with a Kubernetes cluster in Container Service


The instructions in this article show how to use the Azure CLI 2.0 commands to create a Kubernetes cluster. Then you can use the `kubectl` command-line tool to start working with containers in the cluster.

The following image shows the architecture of a container service cluster with one master and two agents. The master serves the Kubernetes REST API. The agent nodes are grouped in an Azure availability set
and run your containers. All VMs are in the same private virtual network and are fully accessible to each other.

## Prerequisites
This walkthrough assumes that you have installed and set up the [Azure CLI v. 2.0](/cli/azure/install-az-cli2). You also must have an SSH RSA public key at `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub`. If you don't have one, see the steps for [OS X and Linux](../virtual-machines/virtual-machines-linux-mac-create-ssh-keys.md) or [Windows](../virtual-machines/virtual-machines-linux-ssh-from-windows.md).






## Create your Kubernetes cluster

Here are brief shell commands using the Azure CLI 2.0 to create your cluster. For more information, see [Use the Azure CLI 2.0 to create an Azure Container Service cluster](container-service-create-acs-cluster-cli.md).

### Create a resource group
To create your cluster, you first need to create a resource group in a specific location. Run commands similar to the following:

```console
RESOURCE_GROUP=my-resource-group
LOCATION=westus
az group create --name=$RESOURCE_GROUP --location=$LOCATION
```

### Create a cluster
Once you have a resource group, you can create a cluster in that group:

```console
DNS_PREFIX=some-unique-value
CLUSTER_NAME=any-acs-cluster-name
az acs create --orchestrator-type=kubernetes --resource-group $RESOURCE_GROUP --name=$CLUSTER_NAME --dns-prefix=$DNS_PREFIX
```

> [!NOTE]
> During deployment, the CLI uploads `~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub` to the Linux VMs.
>

Once that command is complete, you should have a working Kubernetes cluster.

### Connect to the cluster

Following are Azure CLI commands to connect to the Kubernetes cluster from your client computer by using `kubectl`, the Kubernetes command-line client. For more information, see [Connect to an Azure Container Service cluster](container-service-connect.md).

If you don't already have `kubectl` installed, you can install it with:

```console
az acs kubernetes install-cli
```

Once `kubectl` is installed, run the following command to download the master Kubernetes cluster configuration to the ~/.kube/config file:

```console
az acs kubernetes get-credentials --resource-group=$RESOURCE_GROUP --name=$CLUSTER_NAME
```

At this point you should be ready to access your cluster from your machine. Try running:
```console
kubectl get nodes
```

Verify that you can see a list of the machines in your cluster.

## Create your first Kubernetes service

After completing this walkthrough, you will know how to:
 * deploy a Docker application and expose it to the world
 * use `kubectl exec` to run commands in a container 
 * access the Kubernetes dashboard

### Start a simple container
You can run a simple container (in this case the Nginx web server) by running:

```console
kubectl run nginx --image nginx
```

This command starts the Nginx Docker container in a pod on one of the nodes.

To see the running container, run:

```console
kubectl get pods
```

### Expose the service to the world
To expose the service to the world, create a Kubernetes `Service` of type `LoadBalancer`:

```console
kubectl expose deployments nginx --port=80 --type=LoadBalancer
```

This causes Kubernetes to create an Azure load balancer rule with a public IP address. The change
takes a few minutes to propagate to the load balancer. For more information, see [Load balance containers in a Kubernetes cluster in Azure Container Service](container-service-kubernetes-load-balancing.md).

Run the following command to watch the service change from `pending` to display an external IP address:

```console
watch 'kubectl get svc'
```

  ![Image of watching the transition from pending to external IP address](media/container-service-kubernetes-walkthrough/kubernetes-nginx3.png)

Once you see the external IP address, you can browse to it in your browser:

### Browse the Kubernetes UI
To see the Kubernetes web interface, you can use:

```console
kubectl proxy
```
This runs a simple authenticated proxy on localhost, which you can use to view the Kubernetes web UI running on [http://localhost:8001/ui](http://localhost:8001/ui). For more information, see [Using the Kubernetes web UI with Azure Container Service](container-service-kubernetes-ui.md).

### Remote sessions inside your containers
Kubernetes allows you to run commands in a remote Docker container running in your cluster.

```console
# Get the name of your nginx pods
kubectl get pods
```

Using your pod name, you can run a remote command on your pod.  For example:

```console
kubectl exec <pod name> date
```

You can also get a fully interactive session using the `-it` flags:

```console
kubectl exec <pod name> -it bash
```
