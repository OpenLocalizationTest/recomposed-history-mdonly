# Enable public access to an Azure Container Service application

Any DC/OS container in the ACS [public agent pool](container-service-mesos-marathon-ui.md#deploy-a-docker-formatted-container) is automatically exposed to the internet. By default, ports **80**, **443**, **8080** are opened, and any (public) container listening on those ports are accessible. This article shows you how to open more ports for your applications in Azure Container Service.

## Open a port (portal) 

First, we need to open the port we want.

1. Log in to the portal.
2. Find the resource group that you deployed the Azure Container Service to.
3. Select the agent load balancer (which is named similar to **XXXX-agent-lb-XXXX**).

4. Click **Probes** and then **Add**.

5. Fill out the probe form, including the protocol and port. 

    | Field | Description |
    | ----- | ----------- |
    | Name  | A descriptive name of the probe. |
    | Port  | The port of the container to test. |
    | Path  | (When in HTTP mode) The relative website path to probe. HTTPS not supported. |
    | Interval | The amount of time between probe attempts, in seconds.
    | Unhealthy threshold | Number of consecutive probe attempts before considering the container unhealthy. | 
    
    Click OK

6. Back at the properties of the agent load balancer, click **Load balancing rules** and then **Add**.

## Add a security rule (portal)

Next, we need to add a security rule that routes traffic from our opened port through the firewall.

1. Log in to the portal.
2. Find the resource group that you deployed the Azure Container Service to.
3. Select the **public** agent network security group (which is named similar to **XXXX-agent-public-nsg-XXXX**).

4. Select **Inbound security rules** and then **Add**.

5. Fill out the firewall rule to allow your public port.
