# Deploy and use Azure Container Registry

Azure Container Registry is an Azure-based, private registry, for Docker container images. This tutorial walks through deploying an Azure Container Registry instance, and pushing container images to it. Steps completed include:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Deploying an Azure Container Registry instance
> * Tagging container image for Azure Container Registry
> * Uploading image to Azure Container Registry

In subsequent tutorials, you will deploy containers from your private registry as an Azure Container Instances group. 

## Before you begin

This is part two of a three-part tutorial. In the [previous step](./container-instances-tutorial-prepare-app.md), a container image was created for a simple web application written in [Node.js](http://nodejs.org). In this tutorial, this image is pushed to an Azure Container Registry. If you have not created the container image, return to [Tutorial 1 – Create container image](./container-instances-tutorial-prepare-app.md). Alternatively, the steps detailed here work with any container image.

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, this tutorial requires that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.0.4 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI 2.0]( /cli/azure/install-azure-cli). 

## Deploy Azure Container Registry

When deploying an Azure Container Registry, you first need a resource group. An Azure resource group is a logical container into which Azure resources are deployed and managed.

Create a resource group with the [az group create](/cli/azure/group#create) command. In this example, a resource group named *myResourceGroup* is created in the *eastus* region.

```azurecli-interactive
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus
```

Create an Azure Container registry with the [az acr create](/cli/azure/acr#create) command. The name of a Container Registry **must be unique**. Using the following example, update the name with some random characters.

```azurecli-interactive
az acr create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name acidemo --sku Basic --admin-enabled true
```

## Get Azure Container Registry information 

Once the ACR instance has been created, the name, login server name, and authentication password are needed. The following code returns each of these values. Note each value down, they are referenced throughout this tutorial.  

Azure Container Registry Name and Login Server:

```azurecli-interactive
az acr list --resource-group myResourceGroup --query "[].{acrName:name,acrLoginServer:loginServer}" --output table
```

Azure Container Registry Password - update with the registry name.

```azurecli-interactive
az acr credential show --name <acrName> --query passwords[0].value -o tsv
```

## Container registry login

You must log in to your container registry instance before pushing images to it. Use the [docker login](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/) command to complete the operation. When running docker login, you need to provide th registry login server name and credentials.

```bash
docker login --username=<acrName> --password=<acrPassword> <acrLoginServer>
```

The command returns a 'Login Succeeded’ message once completed.

## Tag container image

Each container image needs to be tagged with the `loginServer` name of the registry. This tag is used for routing when pushing container images to an image registry.

To see a list of current images, use the `docker images` command.

```bash
docker images
```

Output:

```bash
REPOSITORY                   TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED              SIZE
aci-tutorial-app             latest              5c745774dfa9        39 seconds ago       6.45 MB
```

Tag the *aci-tutorial-app* image with the loginServer of the container registry. Also, add `:v1` to the end of the image name. This tag indicates the image version number.

```bash
docker tag aci-tutorial-app <acrLoginServer>/aci-tutorial-app:v1
```

Once tagged, run `docker images` to verify the operation.

```bash
docker images
```

Output:

```bash
REPOSITORY                                                TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
aci-tutorial-app                                          latest              5c745774dfa9        39 seconds ago      6.45 MB
mycontainerregistry082.azurecr.io/aci-tutorial-app        v1                  a9dace4e1a17        7 minutes ago       6.45 MB
```

## Push image to Azure Container Registry

Push the *aci-tutorial-app* image to the registry. 

Using the following example, replace the ACR loginServer name with the loginServer from your environment. This takes a couple of minutes to complete.

```bash
docker push <acrLoginServer>/aci-tutorial-app:v1
```

## List images in Azure Container Registry 

To return a list of images that have been pushed to your Azure Container registry, user the [az acr repository list](/cli/azure/acr/repository#list) command. Update the command with the container registry name.

```azurecli-interactive
az acr repository list --name <acrName> --username <acrName> --password <acrPassword> --output table
```

Output:

```azurecli
Result
----------------
aci-tutorial-app
```

And then to see the tags for a specific image, use the [az acr repository show-tags](/cli/azure/acr/repository#show-tags) command.

```azurecli-interactive
az acr repository show-tags --name <acrName> --username <acrName> --password <acrPassword> --repository aci-tutorial-app --output table
```

Output:

```azurecli
Result
--------
v1
```
