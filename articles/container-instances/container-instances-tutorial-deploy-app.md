# Deploy a container group

This is the last of a three-part tutorial. In previous sections, [a container image was created](container-instances-tutorial-prepare-app.md) and [pushed to an Azure Container Registry](container-instances-tutorial-prepare-acr.md). This section completes the tutorial by deploying the container to Azure Container Instances. Steps completed include:

> * Defining a container group using an Azure Resource Manager template
> * Deploying the container group using the Azure CLI
> * Viewing container logs

## Deploy the container using the Azure CLI

The Azure CLI enables deployment of a container to Azure Container Instances in a single command. Since the container image is hosted in the private Azure Container Registry, you must include the credentials required to access it. If necessary, you can query them as shown below.

Container registry login server (update with your registry name):

```azurecli-interactive
az acr show --name <acrName> --query loginServer
```

Container registry password:

```azurecli-interactive
az acr credential show --name <acrName> --query passwords[0].value
```

To deploy your container image from the container registry, run the following command:

```azurecli-interactive
az container create --name aci-tutorial-app --image <acrLoginServer>/aci-tutorial-app:v1 --image-registry-login-server <acrLoginServer> --image-registry-username <acrName> --image-registry-password <acrPassword> --ip-address public -g myResourceGroup
```

Within a few seconds, you will receive an initial response from Azure Resource Manager. To view the state of the deployment, use:

```azurecli-interactive
az container show --name aci-tutorial-app -g myResourceGroup
```

The output includes the public IP address that you can use to access the app in the browser.

```json
...
"ipAddress": {
      "ip": "13.88.176.27",
      "ports": [
        {
          "port": 80,
          "protocol": "TCP"
        }
      ]
    }
...
```


## View the application and container logs

Once the deployment succeeds, you can open your browser to the IP address shown in the output of `az container show`.

![Hello world app in the browser][aci-app-browser]

You can also view the log output of the container:

```azurecli-interactive
az container logs --name aci-tutorial-app -g myResourceGroup
```

Output:

```bash
Server running...
