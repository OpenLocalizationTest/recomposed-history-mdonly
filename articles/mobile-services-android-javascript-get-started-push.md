This topic shows how to use Windows Azure Mobile Services to send push notifications to your Android app. In this tutorial you add push notifications using the Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) to the quickstart project. When complete, your mobile service will send a push notification each time a record is inserted.

>[WACOM.NOTE]Mobile Services now integrates with Windows Azure Notification Hubs to support additional push notification functionality, such as templates, multiple platforms, and scale. This integrated functionality is currently in preview. For more information, see this version of [Get started with push notifications](/en-us/documentation/articles/mobile-services-javascript-backend-windows-store-javascript-get-started-push/).

This tutorial walks you through these basic steps to enable push notifications:

1. [Enable Google Cloud Messaging](#register)
2. [Configure Mobile Services](#configure)
3. [Add push notifications to your app](#add-push)
4. [Update scripts to send push notifications](#update-scripts)
5. [Insert data to receive notifications](#test)

This tutorial is based on the Mobile Services quickstart. Before you start this tutorial, you must first complete either [Get started with Mobile Services] or [Get started with data] to connect your project to the mobile service.  

##<a id="register"></a>Enable Google Cloud Messaging


[WACOM.INCLUDE [Enable GCM](../includes/mobile-services-enable-Google-cloud-messaging.md)]

Next, you will use this API key value to enable Mobile Services to authenticate with GCM and send push notifications on behalf of you app.

##<a id="configure"></a>Configure Mobile Services to send push requests

1. Log on to the [Windows Azure Management Portal], click **Mobile Services**, and then click your app.

   	![](./media/mobile-services-android-get-started-push/mobile-services-selection.png)

2. Click the **Push** tab, click **Enable enhanced push**, and click **Yes** to accept the configuration change.


	![](./media/mobile-services-android-get-started-push/mobile-enable-enhanced-push.png)

	![](../includes/media/mobile-services-javascript-backend-register-windows-store-app/mobile-enable-enhanced-push.png)


	This updates the configuration of your mobile service to use the enhanced push notification functionality provided by Notification Hubs. Some Notification Hubs usage is free with your paid mobile service. For more information, see [Mobile Services Pricing Details](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=311786).

    <div class="dev-callout"><b>Important</b>
	<p>This operation resets your push credentials and changes the behavior of the push methods in your scripts. These changes cannot be reverted. Do not use this method to add a notification hub to a production mobile service. For guidance on how to enable enhanced push notifications in a production mobile service, see <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=391951">this guidance</a>.</p>
    </div>

3. Enter the **API Key** value obtained from GCM in the previous procedure, and then click **Save**.

   	![](./media/mobile-services-android-get-started-push/mobile-push-tab-android.png)

You mobile service is now configured to work with GCM to send push notifications.

##<a id="add-push"></a>Add push notifications to your app


###Add Google Play Services to the project

[WACOM.INCLUDE [Add Play Services](../includes/mobile-services-add-Google-play-services.md)]

###Add code

1. Open the project file **AndroidManifest.xml**. Google Cloud Messaging has some minimum API level requirements for development and testing, which the **minSdkVersion** property in the Manifest must conform to. Consult [Set Up Google Play Services SDK] to determine how low you can set this value, if you need to set it below 16 because you are using an older device. Set the property appropriately.

2. Ensure that in the `uses-sdk` element, the **targetSdkVersion** is set to the number of an SDK platform that has been installed (step 1). It is preferable to set it to the newest version available. 

3. The **uses-sdk** tag might look like this, depending on the choices you made in the preceding steps:

	    <uses-sdk
	        android:minSdkVersion="17"
	        android:targetSdkVersion="19" />
	
4. In the code in the next two steps, replace _`**my_app_package**`_ with the name of the app package for your project, which is the value of the `package` attribute of the `manifest` tag. 

5. Add the following new permissions after the existing `uses-permission` element:

        <permission android:name="**my_app_package**.permission.C2D_MESSAGE" 
            android:protectionLevel="signature" />
        <uses-permission android:name="**my_app_package**.permission.C2D_MESSAGE" /> 
        <uses-permission android:name="com.google.android.c2dm.permission.RECEIVE" />
        <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.GET_ACCOUNTS" />
        <uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WAKE_LOCK" />

6. Add the following code after the `application` opening tag: 

        <receiver android:name="com.microsoft.windowsazure.notifications.NotificationsBroadcastReceiver"
            android:permission="com.google.android.c2dm.permission.SEND">
            <intent-filter>
                <action android:name="com.google.android.c2dm.intent.RECEIVE" />
                <category android:name="**my_app_package**" />
            </intent-filter>
        </receiver>



7. Open the file ToDoItem.java, add the following code to the **TodoItem** class:

			@com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName("handle")
			private String mHandle;
		
			public String getHandle() {
				return mHandle;
			}
		
			public final void setHandle(String handle) {
				mHandle = handle;
			}
		
	This code creates a new property that holds the registration ID.

    <div class="dev-callout"><b>Note</b>
	<p>When dynamic schema is enabled on your mobile service, a new <strong>handle</strong> column is automatically added to the <strong>TodoItem</strong> table when a new item that contains this property is inserted.</p>
    </div>

8. Download and unzip the [Mobile Services Android SDK], open the **notifications** folder, copy the **notifications-1.0.1.jar** file to the *libs* folder of your Eclipse project, and refresh the *libs* folder.

    <div class="dev-callout"><b>Note</b>
	<p>The numbers at the end of the file name may change in subsequent SDK releases.</p>
    </div>

9.  Open the file *ToDoItemActivity.java*, and add the following import statement:

		import com.microsoft.windowsazure.notifications.NotificationsManager;

10. Add the following private variable to the class, where _`<PROJECT_NUMBER>`_ is the Project Number assigned by Google to your app in the preceding procedure:

		public static final String SENDER_ID = "<PROJECT_NUMBER>";

11. In the **onCreate** method, before the MobileServiceClient is instantiated, add this code which registers the Notification Handler for the device:

		NotificationsManager.handleNotifications(this, SENDER_ID, MyHandler.class);



12. Add the following line of code to the **addItem** method, before the item is inserted into the table:

		item.setHandle(MyHandler.getHandle());

	This code sets the `handle` property of the item to the registration ID of the device.

13. In the Package Explorer, right-click the package (under the `src` node), click **New**, click **Class**.

14. In **Name** type `MyHandler`, in **Superclass** type `com.microsoft.windowsazure.notifications.NotificationsHandler`, then click **Finish**

	![][6]

	This creates the new MyHandler class.

15. Add the following import statements:

		import android.content.Context;
		
		import com.microsoft.windowsazure.notifications.NotificationsHandler;
		

16. Add the following code:

		@com.google.gson.annotations.SerializedName("handle")
		private static String mHandle;
	
		public static String getHandle() {
			return mHandle;
		}
	
		public static final void setHandle(String handle) {
			mHandle = handle;
		}
	

17. Replace the existing **onRegistered** method override with the following code:

		@Override
		public void onRegistered(Context context, String gcmRegistrationId) {
			super.onRegistered(context, gcmRegistrationId);
			
			setHandle(gcmRegistrationId);
		}
		

Your app is now updated to support push notifications.


##<a id="update-scripts"></a>Update the registered insert script in the Management Portal

1. In the Management Portal, click the **Data** tab and then click the **TodoItem** table. 

   	![][21]

2. In **todoitem**, click the **Script** tab and select **Insert**.
   
  	![][22]

   	This displays the function that is invoked when an insert occurs in the **TodoItem** table.

3. Replace the insert function with the following code, and then click **Save**:

		function insert(item, user, request) {
			request.execute({
				success: function() {
					// Write to the response and then send the notification in the background
					request.respond();
					push.gcm.send(item.handle, item.text, {
						success: function(response) {
							console.log('Push notification sent: ', response);
						}, error: function(error) {
							console.log('Error sending push notification: ', error);
						}
					});
				}
			});
		}

   	This registers a new insert script, which uses the [gcm object] to send a push notification (the inserted text) to the device provided in the insert request.
