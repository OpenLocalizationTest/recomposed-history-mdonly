#Developing for Storm in HDInsight

[What] - Developing Storm topologies is a pain. You need:
* A data source. This is usually something outside Hadoop, like a queue or API.
* A spout to talk to the data source.
* One or more bolts to process the data.
* One or more bolts to act on the data (raise alerts, send e-mail, or just save it somewhere.)
* If you want to visualize the data in real-time, you have to build some sort of real-time dashboard. You also have to find some communication channel that is common between Java and your dashboard. For example, websockets, signalr, etc.

##Prerequisites

* [Java platform JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) 7 or higher

* [Maven](http://maven.apache.org/)

* [An Azure HDInsight cluster with Storm](/en-us/documentation/articles/hdinsight-storm-getting-started)

##<a id="create"></a>Create the application project

Use the following steps to create the scaffolding for the application.

1. Open a command prompt, Bash session, Terminal session, or whatever you use to type commands on your system.

2. Change directories to the location you wish to create this project. For example, if you have a directory you store all your code projects.

3. Use the following Maven command to create basic scaffolding for your application.

		mvn archetype:generate -DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart -DgroupId=com.microsoft.examples -DartifactId=StormApp -DinteractiveMode=false

	This command will...

	* Create a new directory using the specified *artifactId*. In this case, **StormApp**.
	* Create a **pom.xml** file, which contains Maven information for this project.
	* Create a **src** directory structure, which contains some basic code and tests.

###Add dependencies and plugins

1. Using a text editor, open the **pom.xml** file, and add the following to the **&lt;dependencies>** section. You can add them at the end of the section, after the dependency for junit.

		<dependency>
	      <groupId>org.apache.storm</groupId>
	      <artifactId>storm-core</artifactId>
	      <version>0.9.1-incubating</version>
	      <!-- keep storm out of the jar-with-dependencies -->
	      <scope>provided</scope>
	    </dependency>
	    <dependency>
	      <groupId>org.slf4j</groupId>
	      <artifactId>slf4j-api</groupId>
	      <version>1.7.7</version>
	      <!-- keep slf4j out of the jar-with-dependencies -->
	      <scope>provided</scope>
	    </dependency>

	This adds dependencies for...

	* storm-core - provides core functionality for Storm applications
	* slf4j - provides logging capabilities

	> [WACOM.NOTE] Both of these dependencies are marked with a scope of **provided** to indicate that these dependencies should be downloaded from the Maven repository and used to build the application, but that they will also be available in your runtime environment and do not need to be compiled and included in the JAR created by this project. Both are provided as part of your HDInsight cluster.

2. At the end of the **pom.xml** file, right before the **&lt;/project>** entry, add the following.

		  <build>
		    <plugins>
		      <plugin>
		        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
		        <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
		        <version>2.3.2</version>
		        <configuration>
		          <source>1.7</source>
		          <target>1.7</target>
		        </configuration>
		      </plugin>
			  <plugin>
		        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
		        <artifactId>maven-shade-plugin</artifactId>
		        <version>2.3</version>
		        <configuration>
		          <transformers>
		            <transformer implementation="org.apache.maven.plugins.shade.resource.ApacheLicenseResourceTransformer">
		            </transformer>
		          </transformers>
		        </configuration>
		        <executions>
		          <execution>
		            <phase>package</phase>
		            <goals>
		              <goal>shade</goal>
		            </goals>
		          </execution>
		        </executions>
		      </plugin>
		      <plugin>
		        <groupId>org.codehaus.mojo</groupId>
		        <artifactId>exec-maven-plugin</artifactId>
		        <version>1.2.1</version>
		        <executions>
		          <execution>
		          <goals>
		            <goal>exec</goal>
		          </goals>
		          </execution>
		        </executions>
		        <configuration>
		          <executable>java</executable>
		          <includeProjectDependencies>true</includeProjectDependencies>
		          <includePluginDependencies>false</includePluginDependencies>
		          <classpathScope>compile</classpathScope>
		          <mainClass>${storm.topology}</mainClass>
		        </configuration>
		      </plugin>
		    </plugins>
		  </build>

	This tells Maven to use the following plugins:

	* maven-compiler-plugin - used to compile the Java application
	* maven-shade-plugin - used to produce an uber jar (sometimes called a fat jar) package
	* exec-maven-plugin - used to run the topology locally

##<a id="write"></a>Write the application code

###Create the spout

1. In the **\stormapp\src\main\java\com\microsoft\examples\stormapp** directory, create a new directory named **spouts**.

2. In the **spouts** directory, create a new file named [TBD]. Use the following as the file contents.

	[tbd]

3. Save the file.

###Create the bolts

1. In the **\stormapp\src\main\java\com\microsoft\examples\stormapp** directory, create a new directory named **bolts**.

2. In the **bolts** directory, create the following new files.

	[tbd]

###Create the topology

1. In the **\stormapp\src\main\java\com\microsoft\examples\stormapp** directory, create a new file named **DifferenceTopology.java**.

2. Open the **DifferenceTopology.java** file and use the following as the contents.

##<a id="build"></a>Build and test the topology

1. From the command line, use the following to build the topology.

		mvn compile

2. If no errors were reported, use the following to run the topology locally.

		mvn compile exec:java -Dstorm.topology=com.microsoft.examples.[tbd]

	This will run the topology locally, and write output to stdout.

##<a id="deploy"></a>Deploy and run on HDInsight
