# Microsoft Authenticator application FAQ

The Microsoft Authenticator app replaced the Azure Authenticator app, and is the recommended app when you use Azure Multi-Factor Authentication. This app is available for Windows Phone, Android, and iOS.

**Q: I'm already using the Microsoft Authenticator application for security codes. How do I switch to one-click push notifications?**

If you use a Microsoft account or an Azure Active Directory account, and want to switch over to push notifications, you need to add your account again. This is because the app uses a one-time password. Re-register the device with your account, and set up push notifications.

Some companies may disable this feature according to their security policy.

**Q: When will I be able to use one-click push notifications on my iPhone for my Microsoft account?**

This feature is in beta until the end of August, when it becomes broadly available. If you want to join our beta program, send email to andypick@microsoft.com.

**Q: Do one-click push notifications work for non-Microsoft accounts?**

No, push notifications only work with Microsoft accounts and Azure Active Directory accounts.
