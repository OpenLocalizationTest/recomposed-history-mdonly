# Frequently asked questions about Azure Multi-Factor Authentication
This FAQ answers common questions about Azure Multi-Factor Authentication and using the Multi-Factor Authentication service, including questions about the billing model and usability.

## General
**Q: How does Azure Multi-Factor Authentication Server handle user data?**

With Multi-Factor Authentication Server, user data is stored only on the on-premises servers. No persistent user data is stored in the cloud. When the user performs two-step verification, Multi-Factor Authentication Server sends data to the Azure Multi-Factor Authentication cloud service for authentication. Communication between Multi-Factor Authentication Server and the Multi-Factor Authentication cloud service uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or Transport Layer Security (TLS) over port 443 outbound.

When authentication requests are sent to the cloud service, data is collected for authentication and usage reports. Data fields included in two-step verification logs are as follows:

* **Unique ID** (either user name or on-premises Multi-Factor Authentication Server ID)
* **First and Last Name** (optional)
* **Email Address** (optional)
* **Phone Number** (when using a voice call or SMS authentication)
* **Device Token** (when using mobile app authentication)
* **Authentication Mode**
* **Authentication Result**
* **Multi-Factor Authentication Server Name**
* **Multi-Factor Authentication Server IP**
* **Client IP** (if available)

The optional fields can be configured in Multi-Factor Authentication Server.

The verification result (success or denial), and the reason if it was denied, is stored with the authentication data and is available in authentication and usage reports.

## Billing
Most billing questions can be answered by referring to the [Multi-Factor Authentication Pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/multi-factor-authentication/).

Most questions about the available versions of Azure MFA, or how consumption is calculated for Azure Multi-Factor Authentication Providers can be answered by referring to [How to get Azure Multi-Factor Authentication](multi-factor-authentication-versions-plans.md).

**Q: Is my organization charged for the phone calls and text messages that are used for authentication?**

No, organizations are not charged for individual phone calls placed or text messages sent to users through Azure Multi-Factor Authentication. If you use a per-authentication MFA provider, you are billed for each authentication but not for the method used.

Phone owners might be charged for the phone calls or text messages they receive, according to their personal phone service.

**Q: Does the per-user billing model charge based on the number of users who are configured to use Multi-Factor Authentication or the number of users who perform verifications?**

Billing is based on the number of users configured to use Multi-Factor Authentication.

**Q: How does Multi-Factor Authentication billing work?**

When you purchase Azure Multi-Factor Authentication as a standalone service by creating a per-user or per-authentication MFA provider, your organization's Azure subscription is billed monthly for the actual usage for Azure MFA. This billing model works like virtual machines, websites, etc.

When you purchase a subscription for Azure Multi-Factor Authentication (as a per-user annual license, or as part of a bundle such as Office 365, Azure AD Premium, or Enterprise Mobility + Security), your organization is only charged for the annual license fee for each user.

Learn more about your options in [How to get Azure Multi-Factor Authentication](multi-factor-authentication-versions-plans.md).

**Q: Is there a free version of Azure Multi-Factor Authentication?**

In some instances, yes. 

Multi-Factor Authentication for Azure Administrators offers a subset of Azure MFA features at no cost for access to Microsoft online services, including the Azure and Office 365 administrator portals. This offer applies to the Azure Administrators in Azure Active Directory instances that don't have the full version of Azure MFA through an MFA license, a bundle, or a standalone consumption-based provider. 

Using a Multi-Factor Authentication provider upgrades all admins and users in the directory who are configured to use Multi-Factor Authentication to the full version of Azure Multi-Factor Authentication.

Multi-Factor Authentication for Office 365 offers a subset of Azure MFA features at no cost for access to Microsoft online services, including Exchange Online, SharePoint Online, and other Office 365 services. This offer applies to users who have an Office 365 license assigned, when the corresponding instance of Azure Active Directory doesn't have the full version of Azure MFA throuh an MFA license, a bundle, or a standalone consumption-based provider. Using the Multi-Factor Authentication provider upgrades all admins and users in the directory who are configured to use Multi-Factor Authentication to the full version of Azure Multi-Factor Authentication.

**Q: Can my organization switch between per-user and per-authentication consumption billing models at any time?**

Your organization chooses a billing model when it creates a resource. You cannot change a billing model after the resource is provisioned. You can, however, create another Multi-Factor Authentication resource to replace the original. User settings and configuration options cannot be transferred to the new resource unless both the original provider was linked to an Azure AD tenant and the new provider is linked to the same tenant during creation. An Azure AD tenant can not be linked to two Multi-Factor Authentication providers at the same time. You need to delete the original one before creating a new one.

**Q: Can my organization switch between consumption-based billing and subscriptions (a license-based model) at any time?**

In some instances, yes. 

If your directory has a *per-user* Azure Multi-Factor Authentication provider, you can add MFA licenses. Users with licenses aren't be counted in the per-user consumption-based billing. Users without licenses can still be enabled for MFA through the MFA provider. If you purchase and assign licenses for all of your users configured to use Multi-Factor Authentication, you can delete the Azure Multi-Factor Authentication provider. You can always create another per-user MFA provider if you have more users than licenses in the future. 

If your directory has a *per-authentication* Azure Multi-Factor Authentication, you cannot combine that with MFA licenses. Technically you can, but you don't want to because you'll be billed for every two-step verification request, whether it comes from someone with an MFA licenses assigned or not. 

**Q: Does my organization have to use and synchronize identities to use Azure Multi-Factor Authentication?**

When an organization uses a consumption-based billing model, Azure Active Directory is optional, but not required. If your MFA provider is not linked to an Azure AD tenant, you can only deploy Azure Multi-Factor Authentication Server or the Azure Multi-Factor Authentication SDK on-premises.

Azure Active Directory is required for the license model because licenses are added to the Azure AD tenant when you purchase and assign them to users in the directory.

## Troubleshooting the end-user experience

**Q: What should I tell my users to do if they don’t receive a response on their phone, or don't have their phone with them?**

Hopefully all of your users configured more than one verification method. Tell them to try signing in again, but select a different verification methon on the sign-in page. If the user doesn’t have another method configured, you can update the number assigned to be the user's primary phone.

You can point your users to the [End-user troubleshooting guide](./end-user/multi-factor-authentication-end-user-troubleshoot.md).


**Q: What should I do if one of my users can't get in to their account?**

You can reset the user's account by making them to go through the registration process again. Learn more about [managing user and device settings with Azure Multi-Factor Authentication in the cloud](multi-factor-authentication-manage-users-and-devices.md).

**Q: What should I do if one of my users loses a phone that is using app passwords?**

Delete all of the user's app passwords to prevent unauthorized access. After the user has a replacement device, they can recreate the passwords. Learn more about [managing user and device settings with Azure Multi-Factor Authentication in the cloud](multi-factor-authentication-manage-users-and-devices.md).

**Q: What if a user can't sign in to non-browser apps?**

If your organization still uses legacy clients, and you [allowed the use of app passwords](multi-factor-authentication-whats-next.md#app-passwords), then your users can't sign in to these legacy clients with their username and password. Instead, they need to [set up app passwords](./end-user/multi-factor-authentication-end-user-app-passwords.md). Your users will clear (delete) their sign-in information, restart the app, and then sign in with their username and *app password* instead of their regular password. 

If your organization doesn't have legacy clients, you should not allow your users to create app passwords. 

> [!NOTE]
> Modern authentication for Office 2013 clients
> 
> App passwords are only necessary for apps that don't support modern authentication. Office 2013 clients support modern authentication protocols, but need to be configured. Newer Office clients automatically support modern authentication protocols. For more information, see the [Office 2013 modern authentication public preview announcement](https://blogs.office.com/2015/03/23/office-2013-modern-authentication-public-preview-announced/).

**Q: My users say that sometimes they don't receive the text message, or they reply to two-way text messages but the verification times out.**

Delivery of text messages, and receipt of replies in two-way SMS, is not guaranteed because there are uncontrollable factors that might affect the reliability of the service. These factors include the destination country, the mobile phone carrier, and the signal strength.

If your users often have problems with reliably receiving text messages, tell them to use the mobile app or phone call method instead. The mobile app can receive notifications both over cellular and Wi-Fi connections. In addition, the mobile app can generate verification codes even when the device has no signal at all. The Microsoft Authenticator app is available for [Android](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?Linkid=825072), [IOS](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?Linkid=825073), and [Windows Phone](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?Linkid=825071).

If you must use text messages, we recommend using one-way SMS rather than two-way SMS when possible. One-way SMS is more reliable and it prevents users from incurring global SMS charges from replying to a text message that was sent from another country.

**Q: Can I change the amount of time my users have to enter the verification code from a text message before the system times out?**

It depends. This setting is configurable in Azure MFA Server 7.0 and higher, but not in earlier versions or Azure MFA in the cloud.

Azure MFA Server stores one-time passcodes for 300 seconds (5 minutes) by default. If the user enters their code after the 300 seconds have passed, their authentication is denied. You can adjust the timeout by setting a registry key. 

1. Go to HKLM\Software\Wow6432Node\Positive Networks\PhoneFactor.
2. Create a DWORD registry key called **pfsvc_pendingSmsTimeoutSeconds** and set the time in seconds that you want the Azure MFA Server to store one-time passcodes.


**Q: Can I use hardware tokens with Azure Multi-Factor Authentication Server?**

If you are using Azure Multi-Factor Authentication Server, you can import third-party Open Authentication (OATH) time-based, one-time password (TOTP) tokens, and then use them for two-step verification.

You can use ActiveIdentity tokens that are OATH TOTP tokens if you put the secret key file in a CSV file and import to Azure Multi-Factor Authentication Server. You can use OATH tokens with Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS), Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) when the client system can process access challenge responses, and Internet Information Server (IIS) forms-based authentication.

You can import third-part OATH TOTP tokens with the following formats:  

* Portable Symmetric Key Container (PSKC)  
* CSV if the file contains a serial number, a secret key in Base 32 format, and a time interval  

**Q: Can I use Azure Multi-Factor Authentication Server to secure Terminal Services?**

Yes, but, if you are using Windows Server 2012 R2 or later, only by using Remote Desktop Gateway (RD Gateway).

Security changes in Windows Server 2012 R2 have changed the way that Azure Multi-Factor Authentication Server connects to the Local Security Authority (LSA) security package in Windows Server 2012 and earlier versions. For versions of Terminal Services in Windows Server 2012 or earlier, you can [secure an application with Windows Authentication](multi-factor-authentication-get-started-server-windows.md#to-secure-an-application-with-windows-authentication-use-the-following-procedure). If you are using Windows Server 2012 R2, you need RD Gateway.

**Q: Why would a user receive a Multi-Factor Authentication call from an anonymous caller after setting up caller ID?**

When Multi-Factor Authentication calls are placed through the public telephone network, sometimes they are routed through a carrier that doesn't support caller ID. Because of this, caller ID is not guaranteed, even though the Multi-Factor Authentication system always sends it.

## Errors
**Q: What should users do if they see an “Authentication request is not for an activated account” error message when using mobile app notifications?**

Tell them to follow this procedure to remove their account from the mobile app, then add it again:

1. Go to [your Azure portal profile](https://account.activedirectory.windowsazure.com/profile/) and sign in with your organizational account.
2. Select **Additional Security Verification**.
3. Remove the existing account from the mobile app.
4. Click **Configure**, and then follow the instructions to reconfigure the mobile app.

**Q: What should users do if they see a 0x800434D4L error message when signing in to a non-browser application?**

Currently, a user can use additional security verification only with applications and services that the user can access through a browser. Non-browser applications (also referred to as *rich client applications*) that are installed on a local computer, such as Windows PowerShell, doesn't work with accounts that require additional security verification. In this case, the user might see the application generate an 0x800434D4L error.

A workaround for this is to have separate user accounts for admin-related and non-admin operations. Later, you can link mailboxes between your admin account and non-admin account so that you can sign in to Outlook by using your non-admin account. For more details about this, learn how to [give an administrator the ability to open and view the contents of a user's mailbox](http://help.outlook.com/141/gg709759.aspx?sl=1).
