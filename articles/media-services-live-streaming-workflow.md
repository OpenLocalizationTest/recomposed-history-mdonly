#Delivering Live Streaming Events with Azure Media Services

##Overview

When working with Live Streaming the following components are commonly involved: 

- A camera that is used to broadcast an event.
- A live video encoder that converts signals from the camera to streams that are sent to a live streaming service. 
  
	Optionally, multiple live encoders. For certain critical live events that demand very high availability and quality of experience, it is recommended to employ active-active redundant encoders to achieve seamless failover with no data loss.
- A live streaming service that enables you to do the following: 
	- ingest live content using various live streaming protocols (for example RTMP, RTP, or Smooth Streaming), 
	- encode your stream into adaptive bitrate stream
	- preview your live stream,
	- store the ingested content in order to be streamed later (Video-on-Demand)
	- deliver the content through common streaming protocols (for example, MPEG DASH, Smooth, HLS, HDS) directly to your customers, or to a Content Delivery Network (CDN) for further distribution. 
	
		
**Microsoft Azure Media Services** provides the ability to ingest, preview, encode live stream, store, and deliver your live streaming content. When delivering your content to customers your goal is to deliver a high quality video to various devices under different network conditions. To take care of quality and network conditions, use live encoders to encode your stream to multi-bitrate (adaptive bitrate) video stream.  To take care of streaming on different devices, use Media Services [dynamic packaging](media-services-dynamic-packaging-overview.md) to dynamically re-package your stream to different protocols. Media Services supports delivery of the following adaptive bitrate streaming technologies: HTTP Live Streaming (HLS), Smooth Streaming, MPEG DASH, and HDS (for Adobe PrimeTime/Access licensees only).

In Azure Media Services, **Channels**, **Programs**, and **StreamingEndpoints** handle all the live streaming functionalities including ingest, formatting, DVR, security, scalability and redundancy. 

A **Channel** represents a pipeline for processing live streaming content. A Channel receives live input streams in one of two ways:

- An on-premises live encoder sends multi-bitrate **RTMP** or **Smooth Streaming** (Fragmented MP4) to the Channel. You can use the following live encoders that output multi-bitrate Smooth Streaming: Elemental, Envivio, Cisco.  The following live encoders output RTMP: Adobe Flash Live, Telestream Wirecast, and Tricaster transcoders. The ingested streams pass through **Channel**s without any further processing. When requested, Media Services delivers the stream to customers.
- A single bitrate stream (in one of the following formats: **RTP** (MPEG-TS)), **RTMP**, or **Smooth Streaming** (Fragmented MP4)) is sent to the **Channel** that is enabled to perform live encoding with Media Services. The **Channel** then performs live encoding of the incoming single bitrate stream to a multi-bitrate (adaptive) video stream. When requested, Media Services delivers the stream to customers. 

	Encoding a live stream with Media Services is currently in Preview.
