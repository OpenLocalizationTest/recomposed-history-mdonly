# Create Active Directory application and service principal using the Azure portal

## Overview
When you have an application that needs to access or modify a resource in your subscription, you can create a a service principal and assign that service principal to a role with the correct permission.
Using Azure Resource Manager, the application can perform the permitted management actions on resources that exist in the subscription or as a tenant. 

This topic shows you how to create a new application and service principal using the Azure portal. Currently, you must use the Microsoft Azure portal to create a new service principal. This ability will be added to the Azure preview portal in a later release.

When you create an Active Directory application through the portal, it creates both the application and the service principal.

## Concepts
1. Azure Active Directory (AAD) - an identity and access management service build for the cloud. For more details see: [What is Azure active Directory](active-directory/active-directory-whatis.md)
2. Service Principal - an instance of an application in a directory.
3. AD Application - a directory record in AAD that identifies an application to AAD. 

For a more detailed explanation of applications and service principals, see [Application Objects and Service Principal Objects](active-directory/active-directory-application-objects.md). 
For more information about Active Directory authentication, see [Authentication Scenarios for Azure AD](active-directory/active-directory-authentication-scenarios.md).


## Create the application and service principal objects

1. Login to your Azure Account through the [portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com/).

2. Select **Active Directory** from the left pane.

     ![select Active Directory][1]

3. Select the directory that you want to use for creating the new application.

     ![choose directory][2]

3. To view the applications in your directory, click on **Applications**.

     ![view applications][11]

4. If you haven't created an application in that directory before you should see something similar to following image. Click on **ADD AN APPLICATION**

     ![add application][6]

     Or, click **Add** in the bottom pane.

     ![add][12]

5. Select the type of application you would like to create. For this tutorial, we will not use an application from the gallery.

     ![new application][10]

6. Fill in name of the application and select the type of application you want to use. Since we intend to use this application's service principal to authenticate with Azure Resource Manager, we will elect to create a **WEB APPLICATION AND/OR WEB API** and click the next button.

     ![name application][9]

7. Fill in the properties for your app. For **SIGN-ON URL**, provide the URI to a web-site that describes your application. The existence of the web-site is not validated. 
For **APP ID URI**, provide the URI that identifies your application. The uniqueness or existence of the endpoint is not validated. Click the **Complete** to create you AAD Application.

     ![application properties][4]

## Create an authentication key/password for your application
The portal should now have your application selected.

1. Click on the **Configure** tab to configure your application's password.

     ![configure application][3]

2. Scroll down to the **Keys** section and select how long you would like your password to be valid.

     ![keys][7]

3. Select **Save** to create your key.

     ![save][13]

     The saved key is displayed and you can copy it.

     ![saved key][8]

4. You can now use you key to authenticate as a service principal. You will need your **CLIENT ID** in addition to your **KEY** to sign in. Go to **CLIENT ID** and copy it.
  
     ![client id][5]


Your application is now ready and the service principal created on your tenant. When signing in as a service principal be sure to use:

* **CLIENT ID** - as your user name.
* **KEY** - as your password.
