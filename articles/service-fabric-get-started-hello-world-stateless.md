# Getting Started with Stateless Services

In this tutorial, youâ€™ll implement a simple "Hello World" service that prints out current date and time periodically. The service is an example of a background worker that runs constantly. This pattern is very similar to how a Cloud Service Worker Role is implemented.

1. Launch Visual Studio 2015 CTP 6 as **Administrator**, and create a new **Windows Fabric Stateless Service** Project named **HelloWorldApp**.
![][8]
    
  You will see 2 projects in the created solution. The first project is the application project (_HelloWorldApp_), which contains the application manifest and a number of PowerShell scripts that help you to deploy your application. The second is the service project (_StatelessService1_), which contains the actual service implementation.

1. Open **Service.cs** in the **StatelessService1** project, import the following namespaces:
```c#
        using System.Diagnostics;
```

1. Replace the code in **RunAsync** method:
```c#
        protected override async Task RunAsync(CancellationToken cancellationToken)
        {
            Trace.WriteLine("Starting Hello World service.");

            while (!cancellationToken.IsCancellationRequested)
            {
                cancellationToken.ThrowIfCancellationRequested();
                Trace.WriteLine("Hello World! at " + DateTime.Now.ToLongTimeString());
                await Task.Delay(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1), cancellationToken);
            }
        }
```

## Test locally

1. ![][6] If you haven't done so, you need to launch a local cluster first. Launch **Windows PowerShell** as **administrator** and execute the **DevClusterSetup.ps1** script under the **_FabActSdk_\ClusterSetup\Local** folder (see step 4 of installation).

  >**NOTE**: Your local cluster might be already running, in which case the script will fail with many errors. If you want to clean up the local cluster, run the **CleanCluster.ps1** script under the same folder.

2. You can now build and deploy your service. Press **F5**, and your service will be started. Once the service is running, you can see its output on the **Output** window of Visual Studio.

    ![][4]

  >**NOTE**: You see repeated outputs in each second because by default when a service is deployed it has three instances running for load-balancing and high-availability. The number of instances is controlled by the **Instance** attribute in **ApplicationManifest.xml**, which you can find under the _HelloWorldApp_ project.

3. Stop the program.

  >**NOTE**: To debug locally, set break points at the lines of interest. 

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, you created a "Hello World" stateless service and tested it locally.
