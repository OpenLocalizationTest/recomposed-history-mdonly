# Add a web application firewall

Azure Security Center may recommend that you add a web application firewall from a Microsoft partner in order to secure your web applications. This document walks you through an example of how to do this.

> [AZURE.NOTE] The information in this document applies to the preview release of Azure Security Center. This document introduces the service by using an example deployment.  This is not a step-by-step guide.

## Implement the recommendation

1. In the **Recommendations** blade, select recommendation **Secure web application using web application firewall**. This opens the **Unprotected Web Applications** blade.
![][1]

2. Select a web application, the **Add a Web Application Firewall** blade opens.
3. Select **Barracuda Web Application Firewall**. A blade opens that provides you information about the **Barracuda Web Application Firewall**.

4. Click **Create** in the information blade.
![][2]
5. The **New Web Application Firewall** blade opens, where you can perform **VM Configuration** steps and provide **WAF Information**. Select **VM Configuration**.

6. In the **VM Configuration** blade you enter information required to spin up the virtual machine that will run the WAF.
![][3]
7. Return to the **New Web Application Firewall** blade and select **WAF Information**. In the **WAF Information** blade you configure the WAF itself. Step 6 allows you to configure the virtual machine on which the WAF will run and step 7 enables you to provision the WAF itself.

8. Return to the **Recommendations** blade. A new entry was generated after you created the WAF, called **Finalize web application firewall setup**. This entry lets you know that you need to complete the process of actually wiring up the WAF within the Azure Virtual Network so that it can protect the application.

9. Select **Finalize web application firewall setup**. A new blade opens. You can see that there is a web application that needs to have its traffic rerouted.
10. Select the web application. A blade opens that gives you steps for finalizing the web application firewall setup. Complete the steps, and then click **Restrict traffic**. Security Center will then do the wiring-up for you.

The logs from that WAF are now fully integrated. Security Center can start automatically gathering and analyzing the logs so that it can surface important security alerts to you.
