# How to setup VPN connections in Azure API Management

API Management's VPN support allows you to connect your API Management proxy to an Azure Virtual Network. This allows API Management customers to securely connect to their backend web services that are on-premises or are otherwise inaccessible to the public internet.

>VPN connectivity is only available in the **Premium** tier. To switch to it, open your API Management service in the [Management Portal][] and then open the **Scale** tab. Under the **General** section select the Premium tier and click Save.

To enable VPN connectivity, open your API Management service in the [Management Portal][] and switch to the **Configure** tab. 

Under the VPN section, switch **VPN connection** to **On**.

You will now see a list of all regions where your API Management service is provisioned.

Select a VPN and subnet for each region. The list of VPNs is populated based on the virtual networks available in your Azure subscription.

Click **Save** at the bottom of the screen. You will not be able to perform other operations on the API Management service from the Azure management portal while it is updating.

After your API Management service is connected to the VPN, accessing web services within the virtual network is no different than accessing public services. Just type in the local address of your web service into the **Web service URL** field when creating a new API or editing an existing one.
