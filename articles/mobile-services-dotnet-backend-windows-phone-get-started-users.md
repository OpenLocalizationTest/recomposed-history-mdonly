This topic shows you how to authenticate users in Azure Mobile Services from your Windows Phone app. In this tutorial, you add authentication to the quickstart project using an identity provider that is supported by Mobile Services. After being successfully authenticated and authorized by Mobile Services, the user ID value is displayed.

This tutorial walks you through these basic steps to enable authentication in your app:

1. [Register your app for authentication and configure Mobile Services]
2. [Restrict table permissions to authenticated users]
3. [Add authentication to the app]

This tutorial is based on the Mobile Services quickstart. You must also first complete the tutorial [Get started with Mobile Services]. 

>[WACOM.NOTE]This tutorial demonstrates the basic method provided by Mobile Services to authenticate users by using a variety of identity providers. This method is easy to configure and supports multiple providers. However, this method also requires users to log-in every time your app starts. To instead use Live Connect to provide a single sign-on experience in your Windows Phone app, see the topic [Single sign-on for Windows Phone apps by using Live Connect].

##<a name="register"></a> Register your app for authentication and configure Mobile Services

[WACOM.INCLUDE [mobile-services-register-authentication](../includes/mobile-services-register-authentication.md)] 

<ol start="5">
<li><p>In Visual Studio, open the Web.config file for the mobile service project, and in the appSettings section, set the app identifier and shared secret values obtained from your identity provider.</p>
<p>These settings are used during local development. After publishing your mobile service project to Azure, these settings are overridden by the values set in the portal.</p></li>
</ol>

## <a name="permissions"></a>Restrict permissions to authenticated users

[WACOM.INCLUDE [mobile-services-restrict-permissions-dotnet-backend](../includes/mobile-services-restrict-permissions-dotnet-backend.md)] 

<ol start="3">
<li><p>In Visual Studio 2013, open the project that you created when you completed the tutorial <a href="/en-us/documentation/articles/mobile-services-dotnet-backend-windows-phone-get-started/">Get started with Mobile Services</a>.</p></li> 
<li><p>Press the F5 key to run this quickstart-based app; verify that an unhandled exception with a status code of 401 (Unauthorized) is raised after the app starts.</p>
   
   	<p>This happens because the app attempts to access Mobile Services as an unauthenticated user, but the <em>TodoItem</em> table now requires authentication.</p></li>
</ol>

Next, you will update the app to authenticate users before requesting resources from the mobile service.

##<a name="add-authentication"></a>Add authentication to the app

[WACOM.INCLUDE [mobile-services-windows-phone-authenticate-app](../includes/mobile-services-windows-phone-authenticate-app.md)]

##<a name="tokens"></a>Store the authorization tokens on the client

[WACOM.INCLUDE [mobile-services-windows-phone-authenticate-app-with-token](../includes/mobile-services-windows-phone-authenticate-app-with-token.md)] 

## <a name="next-steps"> </a>Next steps

In the next tutorial, [Service-side authorization of Mobile Services users][Authorize users with scripts], you will take the user ID value provided by Mobile Services based on an authenticated user and use it to filter the data returned by Mobile Services.
