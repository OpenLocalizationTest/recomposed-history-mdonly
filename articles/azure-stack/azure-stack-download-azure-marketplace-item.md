# Download marketplace items from Azure to Azure Stack

After you have registered Azure Stack, you can download marketplace items from Azure and use them in your Azure Stack deployment.

1. Sign in to the Azure Stack portal as a service administrator.
2. Click **More Services** > **Marketplace Management** > **Add from Azure**.
3. Select the item you want in the list and then click **Download**. This starts downloading the VM image for the item you selected. Download times vary.
4. After the download succeeds, you can deploy the new marketplace item, either as a service administrator or a tenant. Click **+New**, use **Search the marketplace** to find your item, and then click **Create**.
5. Follow the instructions to deploy your item.
