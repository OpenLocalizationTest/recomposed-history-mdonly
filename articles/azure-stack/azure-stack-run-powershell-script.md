# Deploy Azure Stack POC
To deploy the Azure Stack POC, you first need to [prepare the deployment machine](#prepare-the-deployment-machine) and then [run the PowerShell deployment script](#run-the-powershell-deployment-script).

## Prepare the deployment machine

1. Make sure that you can physically connect to the deployment machine, or have physical console access (such as KVM). You will need such access after you reboot the deployment machine in step 9.

2. Make sure the deployment machine meets the [minimum requirements](azure-stack-deploy.md). You can use the [Deployment Checker for Azure Stack Technical Preview 1](https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Deployment-Checker-for-76d824e1) to confirm your requirements.

3.  [Download](https://azure.microsoft.com/overview/azure-stack/try/?v=try) or copy the Azure Stack POC deployment package to a folder on your C drive, (for example, c:\\AzureStack).

4.  Run the **Microsoft Azure Stack POC.exe** file.

    This creates the \\Microsoft Azure Stack POC\\ folder containing the following items:

	-   MicrosoftAzureStackP.vhdx: Azure Stack deployment virtual machine image

5. Double-click the c:\AzureStack\MicrosoftAzureStack.vhdx file. This will mount the VHDX as two new drive letters. One has the **windows** folder in it. Take note of that drive letter.

6. Open a PowerShell window as an administrator and run the bcdboot command below. This command clears any previously leftover TP2 environment and sets the default boot option to the VHD image you just mounted.

    if (bcdedit | Select-String -Pattern "AzureStack TP2")
    {
        bcdedit /delete '{default}'
    }
    bcdboot <mounted drive letter>:\windows
    bcdedit /set {default} description "AzureStack TP2"

7. Reboot the machine. It will automatically run Windows Setup as the system is prepared. After this point, you will need an alternate connection to the HOST other than RDP.

8. When asked, provide your country, language, keyboard, and other preferences. If you're asked for the product key, you can find it [System Requirements and Installation](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt126134.aspx).

<<<<<<< HEAD
9. Log in using a local account with administrator permissions.

10. Verify that **at least** four drives for Azure Stack POC data:
=======
6. Copy WindowsServer2016Datacenter.vhdx to the C:\ drive and rename it MicrosoftAzureStackPOCBoot.vhdx.

7. In File Explorer, right-click MicrosoftAzureStackPOCBoot.vhdx and click **Mount**.

8. Open a Command Prompt window as an administrator and run the bcdboot command below. This command creates a dual boot environment. From this point, you should boot into the upper boot option.

    	bcdboot <mounted drive letter>:\windows

9. Reboot the machine. It will automatically run Windows Setup as the VHD system is prepared. After this point, you will need to physically connect to the deployment machine, or have physical console access, to complete the following steps.

10. If your BIOS includes such an option, you should configure it to use the local time instead of UTC time.

11. When asked, provide your country, language, keyboard, and other preferences. If you're asked for the product key, you can find it [System Requirements and Installation](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt126134.aspx).

12. When prompted, set the password for the Administrator account, and then login with that account name and password.

13. After rebooting and  logging in, if you don’t have DHCP,set up the static configuration on the NIC.

14. Enable Remote Desktop Connections by going into the **System Properties** and selecting the **Allow remote connections to this computer** option.

15. Log in using a local account with administrator permissions.

16. Verify that **exactly** four drives for Azure Stack POC data:
>>>>>>> ba42587acca9da6f4cf5eb2e0f270a57f313e09b
  - Are visible in disk management
  - Are not in use
  - Have no partitions

<<<<<<< HEAD
11. Verify that the host is not joined to a domain.

12. Using Internet Explorer, verify network connectivity to Azure.com.
=======
17. Verify that the host is not joined to a domain.

18. Using Internet Explorer, verify network connectivity to Azure.com.
>>>>>>> ba42587acca9da6f4cf5eb2e0f270a57f313e09b

> [AZURE.IMPORTANT] The TP2 POC deployment supports exactly one NIC for networking. If you have multiple NICs, make sure that only one is enabled (and all others are disabled) before running the deployment script below.

## Run the PowerShell deployment script

<<<<<<< HEAD
1. Open PowerShell as an administrator.
=======
1. Move the following deployment files from D:\Microsoft Azure Stack POC\ to C:\Microsoft Azure Stack POC\.
    - DeployAzureStack.ps1
    - MicrosoftAzureStackPOC.vhdx
    - SQLServer14.vhdx
    - WindowsServer2012R2DatacenterEval.vhd
    - WindowsServer2016Datacenter.vhdx

2.  Open PowerShell as an administrator.

3.  In PowerShell, go to the Azure Stack folder location (\\Microsoft Azure Stack POC\\ if you used the default).

4.  Run the deploy command:
>>>>>>> ba42587acca9da6f4cf5eb2e0f270a57f313e09b

2. In PowerShell, go to the Azure Stack folder location (\\Microsoft Azure Stack POC\\ if you used the default).

3. Run the deploy command:

    	.\InstallAzureStack.ps1 –Verbose

4. At the **Enter the password for the built-in administrator** prompt, enter a password and then confirm it. This is the password to all the virtual machines. Be sure to record it.

<<<<<<< HEAD
5. At the **Please login to your Azure account in the pop-up Azure authentication page**, hit any key to open the Microsoft Azure sign-in dialog box.

6. Enter the credentials for your Azure Active Directory account. This user must be the Global Admin in the directory tenant.

7. The deployment process will take a few hours, during which one automated system reboot will occur. If you want to monitor the deployment progress, sign in as the domain administrator (for the azurestack\AzureStackAdmin).
=======
5.  At the **Enter the password for the built-in administrator** prompt, enter a password and then confirm it. This is the password to all the virtual machines. Be sure to record this Service Admin password.

6.  At the **Please login to your Azure account in the pop-up Azure authentication page**, hit any key to open the Microsoft Azure sign-in dialog box.

7.  Enter the credentials for your Azure Active Directory account. This user must be the Global Admin in the directory tenant

8.  Back in PowerShell, at the account selection confirmation prompt, enter *y*. This creates two users and three applications for Azure Stack in that directory tenant: an admin user for Azure Stack, a tenant user for the TiP tests, and one application each for the Portal, API, and Monitoring resource providers. In addition to this, the installer adds consents for the Azure PowerShell, XPlat CLI, and Visual Studio to that Directory Tenant.

9.  At the **Microsoft Azure Stack POC is ready to deploy. Continue?** prompt, enter *y*.

10.  The deployment process will take a few hours, during which several automated system reboots will occur. Signing in during deployment will automatically launch a PowerShell window that will display deployment progress. The PowerShell window closes after deployment completes.

11. On the Azure Stack POC machine, sign in as an AzureStack\administrator, open **Server Manager**, and turn off **IE Enhanced Security Configuration** for both admins and users.

If the deployment fails with a time or date error, configure the BIOS to use Local Time instead of UTC. Then redeploy.
>>>>>>> ba42587acca9da6f4cf5eb2e0f270a57f313e09b

If the script fails, restart the script. If it continues to fail, wipe and restart.

You can collect all the deployment related logs on the POC environment by invoking this PowerShell script: TBD.

### Deployment script examples

If your AAD Identity is only associated with ONE AAD Directory:

    cd C:\CloudDeployment\Configuration
    $adminpass = ConvertTo-SecureString "<LOCAL ADMIN PASSWORD>" -AsPlainText -Force
    $aadpass = ConvertTo-SecureString "<AAD GLOBAL ADMIN ACCOUNT PASSWORD>" -AsPlainText -Force
    $aadcred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential ("<AAD GLOBAL ADMIN ACCOUNT>", $aadpass)
    .\InstallAzureStackPOC.ps1 -AdminPassword $adminpass -AADAdminCredential $aadcred

If your AAD Identity is associated with GREATER THAN ONE AAD Directory:

    cd C:\CloudDeployment\Configuration
    $adminpass = ConvertTo-SecureString "<LOCAL ADMIN PASSWORD>" -AsPlainText -Force
    $aadpass = ConvertTo-SecureString "<AAD GLOBAL ADMIN ACCOUNT PASSWORD>" -AsPlainText -Force
    $aadcred = New-Object System.Management.Automation.PSCredential "<AAD GLOBAL ADMIN ACCOUNT> example: user@AADDirName.onmicrosoft.com>", $aadpass)
    .\InstallAzureStackPOC.ps1 -AdminPassword $adminpass -AADAdminCredential $aadcred -AADDirectoryTenantName "<SPECIFIC AAD DIRECTORY example: AADDirName.onmicrosoft.com>"

If your environment DOES NOT have DHCP enabled, you will need to include the following ADDITIONAL parameters to one of the options above (example usage provided):

    -NatIPv4Subnet 10.10.10.0/24 -NatIPv4Address 10.10.10.3 -NatIPv4DefaultGateway 10.10.10.1

> [AZURE.NOTE] Append this to one of the .\InstallAzureStackPOC.ps1 calls above (depending on your situation).


### DeployAzureStack.ps1 optional parameters

| Parameter | Required/Optional | Description |
| --------- | ----------------- | ----------- |
| AADAdminCredential | Optional | Sets the Azure Active Directory user name and password. These Azure credentials can be either an Org ID or a Microsoft Account. To use Microsoft Account credentials, do not include this parameter in the cmdlet, thus prompting the Azure Authentication popup during deployment (this will create the authentication and refresh tokens used during deployment). |
| AADDirectoryTenantName | Required | Sets the tenant directory. Use this parameter to specify a specific directory where the AAD account has permissions to manage multiple directories. Full Name of an AAD Directory Tenant in the format of <directoryName>.onmicrosoft.com. |
| AdminPassword | Required | Sets the local administrator account and all other user accounts on all the virtual machines that will be created as part of POC deployment. This must match the current local administrator password on the host. |
| AzureEnvironment | Optional | Select the Azure Environment with which you want to register this Azure Stack deployment. Options include *Public Azure*, *Azure - China*, *Azure - US Government*. |
| EnvironmentDNS | Optional | A DNS server is created as part of the Azure Stack deployment. To allow computers inside of the solution to resolve names outside of the stamp, provide your existing infrastructure DNS server. The in-stamp DNS server will forward unknown name resolution requests to this server. |
| NatIPv4Address | Required for DHCP NAT support | Sets a static IP address for the NAT VM. Only use this parameter if the DHCP can’t assign a valid IP address to access the Internet. |
| NatIPv4DefaultGateway | Required for DHCP NAT support | Sets the default gateway used with the static IP address for the NAT VM. Only use this parameter if the DHCP can’t assign a valid IP address to access the Internet.  |
| NatIPv4Subnet | Required for DHCP NAT support | IP Subnet prefix used for DHCP over NAT support. Only use this parameter if the DHCP can’t assign a valid IP address to access the Internet.  |
| NatSubnetPrefix | Required for DHCP NAT support | IP Subnet prefix to be used for DHCP over NAT support. Only use this parameter if the DHCP can’t assign a valid IP address to access the Internet. |
| PublicVLan | Optional | Sets the VLAN ID. Only use this parameter if the host and NATVM must configure VLAN ID to access the physical network (and Internet).
For example, `.\InstallAzureStackPOC.ps1 –Verbose –PublicVLan 305` |
| Rerun | Optional | Use this flag to re-run deployment.  All previous input will be used. Re-entering data previously provided is not supported because several unique values are generated and used for deployment. |
| TimeServer | Optional | Use this parameter if you need to specify a specific time server. |

## Turn off telemetry for Microsoft Azure Stack POC (optional)

Before deploying Microsoft Azure Stack POC, you can turn off telemetry for Microsoft Azure Stack on the machine from which the deployment is performed. To turn off this feature on a single machine, please refer to: [http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/feedback-diagnostics-privacy-faq](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/feedback-diagnostics-privacy-faq), and change the **Diagnostic and usage data** setting to **Basic**.

After deploying Microsoft Azure Stack POC, you can turn off telemetry on all the virtual machines that joined the Azure Stack domain. To create a group policy and manage your telemetry settings on those virtual machines, please refer to: [https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt577208(v=vs.85).aspx\#BKMK\_UTC](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt577208%28v=vs.85%29.aspx#BKMK_UTC), and select **0** or **1** for the **Allow Telemetry** group policy. There are two virtual machines (bgpvm and natvm) not joining the Azure Stack domain. To change the Feedback and Diagnostics settings on these virtual machines separately, please refer to:  [http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/feedback-diagnostics-privacy-faq](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-10/feedback-diagnostics-privacy-faq).
