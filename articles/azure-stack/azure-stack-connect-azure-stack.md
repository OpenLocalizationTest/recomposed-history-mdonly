# How to connect to Microsoft Azure Stack POC

The Microsoft Azure Stack POC is a single-computer environment provided for evaluation purposes. As such, you have the following options when connecting to the environment:

## Log into the portal as service administrator

1.  Log in to the Microsoft Azure Stack physical machine.

2.  Double-click the **ClientVM.AzureStack.local.rdp** desktop icon to open a Remote Desktop Connection to the client virtual machine. This automatically uses the AzureStack\\AzureStackUser account that was created by the deployment script. Use the admin password you gave in step 5 of the script process at the **Enter the password for the built-in administrator** prompt.

3.  On the ClientVM.AzureStack.local desktop, double-click **Microsoft Azure Stack POC Portal** icon (https://portal.azurestack.local/).

4.  Log in using the service administrator account.

## Log into the portal as a tenant

Before logging in as a tenant, you must have created a tenant account. If you donâ€™t already have a tenant account, see the instruction in [Appendix A: Add a new user in Azure Active Directory](azure-stack-add-new-user-aad.md).

1.  Log in to the Microsoft Azure Stack physical machine.

2.  Double-click the **ClientVM.AzureStack.local.rdp** desktop icon to open a Remote Desktop Connection to the client virtual machine. This automatically uses the AzureStack\\AzureStackUser account that was created by the deployment script. Use the admin password you gave in step 5 of the script process at the **Enter the password for the built-in administrator** prompt.

3.  On the ClientVM.AzureStack.local desktop, double-click **Microsoft Azure Stack POC Portal** icon (https://portal.azurestack.local/).

4.  Log in using a tenant account.

>[AZURE.NOTE] RDP may restrict how many users can access the physical Microsoft Azure POC host. To enable multiple users, see [Appendix B:Enable multiple concurrent user connections](azure-stack-enable-multiple-concurrent-users.md).
