# Region management in Azure Stack
Azure Stack has the concept of regions, which are logical entities comprised of the hardware resources that make up the Azure Stack infrastructure. Inside Region Management, you can find all resources that are required to successfully operate the Azure Stack infrastructure lifecycle.

The Azure Stack Development Kit is a single-node deployment, and equals one region. If you set up another instance of Azure Stack Development Kit on separate hardware, this instance is a different region.

## Information available through the Region Management tile
Azure Stack has a set of region management capabilities available in the **Region Management** tile. This tile is available to a cloud administrator on the default dashboard in the administrator portal. Through this tile, you can monitor and update your Azure Stack region and its components, which are region-specific.

 If you click a region in the Region Management tile, you can access the following information:

1. **The resource menu**. Here, you can access specific infrastructure management areas, and view and manage tenant resources such as storage accounts and virtual networks.

2. **Alerts**. This tile lists system-wide alerts and provides details on each of those alerts.

3. **Updates**. In this tile, you can view the update status of your Azure Stack infrastructure, including version, update availability, and updates history.

4. **Resource providers**. Resource providers is the place to manage the tenant functionality offered by the components required to run Azure Stack. Each resource provider comes with an administrative experience. This experience can include alerts for the specific provider, metrics, and other management capabilities specific to the resource provider.
 
5. **Infrastructure roles**. Infrastructure roles are the components necessary to run Azure Stack. By clicking a role, you can view the alerts associated with the specific role and the role instances where this role is running. Although there is the capability to start, restart, or shut down an infrastructure role instance, we donâ€™t recommend that you do so without guidance from the [Azure Stack forum](https://aka.ms/azurestackforum).
