# Manage updates in Azure Stack

In the Azure Stack Development Kit, you can preview the experience for managing Azure Stack updates in a multi-node environment. Because virtual machines are not highly available in the development kit, you cannot apply updates through the **Updates** tile.

In the Azure Stack administrator portal, you can determine the current version (or build number) of Azure Stack.

## Determine the current version

To determine the current version of Azure Stack, do either of the following in the administrator portal:

- On the dashboard, view the current version in the **Updates** tile.
- On the **Region management** tile, click the region name (such as **local**). View the current version in the **Updates** tile.
