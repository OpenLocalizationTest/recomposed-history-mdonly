# Install PowerShell for Azure Stack  

Azure Stack compatible Azure PowerShell modules are required to work with Azure Stack. In this guide, we walk you through the steps required to install PowerShell in Azure Stack. You can use the steps described in this article either from MAS-CON01, Azure Stack host computer, or from a Windows-based external client if you are connected through VPN. 

   > [!NOTE]
   > The following steps require PowerShell 5.0.  To check your version, run $PSVersionTable.PSVersion and compare the "Major" version.  
   > 
   >

Azure Stack supports the 1.2.8 version of Azure PowerShell. Azure Stack compatible AzureRM commands are installed from the PowerShell Gallery. To verify if PowerShell Gallery is available, open a PowerShell Console on the MAS-CON01 computer or on your local computer if you are connected through VPN and run the following command:  

```powershell

Get-PSRepository 

```
This command returns a list of PowerShell module repositories that are registered for the current user.

You can install Azure Stack PowerShell commands in the following scenarios:  

a. [Install the required version.](#install-the-required-version)  
b. [Uninstall the existing version and install the required version.](#uninstall-the-existing-version-and-install-the-required-version)  

## Install the required version

To install the Azure Stack PowerShell modules on a computer, which doesn’t already contain any installed PowerShell modules, use the following steps:  

1. Run the following command to install the required version of the AzureRM modules for Compute, Storage, Network, Key Vault etc.  
    ```powershell
    # To install the module in current user scope
    Install-Module -Name AzureRM -RequiredVersion 1.2.8 -Scope CurrentUser
    
    # To install the module for all users on your computer. Run this command in an elevated PowerShell session
    Install-Module -Name AzureRM -RequiredVersion 1.2.8
    ```  
    
The **Scope** parameter is optional and can be set to the following values:  
* **CurrentUser**-  installs the module only in the current user account.  
* **All Users** or not specified- installs the module to a location that all users can access.  

When prompted, type **yes** to trust the PSGallery repository.

2. In addition to the AzureRM modules, you should also install the Azure Stack-specific PowerShell modules such as AzureStackAdmin, AzureStackStorage, etc. by running the following command:  
    ```powershell
    # To install the module in current user scope
    Install-Module -Name AzureStack -RequiredVersion 1.2.8 -Scope CurrentUser
    
    # To install the module for all users on your computer. Run this command in an elevated PowerShell session
    Install-Module -Name AzureStack -RequiredVersion 1.2.8
    ```

3. To confirm the installation of AzureRM modules, run the following command:
  ```powershell
    Get-Module -ListAvailable
 ```
    If the installation is successful, this command lists the AzureRM and AzureStack modules.


## Uninstall the existing version and install the required version

To install the Azure Stack PowerShell modules on a computer, which already contains a different version of PowerShell modules, use the following steps:  

1. Uninstall the existing Azure PowerShell commands (AzureRM and Azure modules). To uninstall, close all the active PowerShell sessions and run the following command:
  ```powershell
    Get-Module -ListAvailable | where-Object {$_.Name -like “Azure*”} | Uninstall-Module
```

2. After uninstalling, follow the steps described in [Install the required version](#install-the-required-version) section.
