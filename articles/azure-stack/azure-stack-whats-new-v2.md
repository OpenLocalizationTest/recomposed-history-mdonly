# What's new in Azure Stack Technical Preview 2

## Cloud Tenant
### Services
  
Keep your secrets safe with [Key Vault](azure-stack-intro-key-vault.md), which provides secure management of your key and password assets with built-in auditing and monitoring.

Build your apps on the latest application platform with an updated App Service Resource Provider (RP) and administration capabilities:
   - New RP features enable scale-up and scale-out, source control integration, and deployment slots empowering you to develop on the cloud in your datacenter.
   - API App Service allows you to bring your existing APIs and apply enterprise security, access control, and scale.
   - Mobile Apps service provides API and table storage services - allowing you to build the cross-platform mobile apps.
   - Web App updates enable new features such as WebJobs and PHP 7 support.

### IaaS
Get connected with new network features, enabling connection to other resources and locations.   
   - [iDNS](azure-stack-what-is-idns.md) provides internal network name registration and DNS resolution without additional DNS infrastructure required.
   - [Virtual Network Gateways](azure-stack-virtual-network-gateways.md) provide new VPN connectivity options to other resources, including Azure and other physical locations.
   - User Defined Routes allow you to route network traffic through firewall, security, or other appliances and services.
   - Now you can create network resources from the marketplace.   

Storage is a key capability of IaaS resources, and storage on Azure Stack continues to evolve. 
   - [Azure Queues](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd179353.aspx) enable reliable, persistent messaging within and between services.  
   - [Storage analytics](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/hh343270.aspx) performs logging and provides metrics data for a storage account. You can use this data to trace requests, analyze usage trends, and diagnose issues with your storage account.
   - Storage service validation with common tools and SDKs, such as Azure CLI, PowerShell, .NET, Python, and Java SDK 
   - [Storage Account Shared Access Signature](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/mt584140.aspx) enable granular delegation of access to your storage services without having to share your full account key.  
   - Storage services now use [Group Managed Service Accounts](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh831477(v=ws.11).aspx#BKMK_group_managed_sa) for strong security with low management overhead

You can now deallocate and capture virtual machines, redeploy virtual machine extensions, and resize virtual machine disks.  Additionally, you can now export Resource Manager templates from portal, allowing you to save time and ensure resource consistency.

## Cloud Administrator

Billing and consumption APIs enable integration with your billing and other tracking systems.  These new metrics and APIs allow for integration either with a customer billing system, or chargeback/showback systems for enterprise IT.   

You can now capture plan and offer details in Resource Manager templates for redeployment, enabling consistent tenant onboarding.
 
Introducing Azure Stack Regions - regions are the logical scaling and management element of Azure Stack. In this release, you can view resource consumption of network, storage, and compute by region.

Delegated Providers enable downstream resellers to offer your Azure Stack services to their tenants.

This release enables you to provide the most efficient allocation of resources, with on-demand reclamation of unused tenant resource capacity now available.

New monitoring capabilities enable you to view alerts in the portal and retrieve via REST API and see common alerts by region, without having to leave the portal.  

Test-in-Production(TiP) tests have been renamed to System Health Tests to better reflect purpose.
