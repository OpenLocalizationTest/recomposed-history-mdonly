# What is Azure Stack?

Microsoft Azure Stack is a hybrid cloud platform that lets you deliver Azure services from your organizationâ€™s datacenter.  Azure Stack was designed to help you in key scenarios, like:

* Meeting security or compliance requirements
* Disconnected environments, where you need local Azure resources without connectivity to the Internet
  

## What is Azure Stack Development Kit?
Microsoft Azure Stack Development Kit is a single-node version of Azure Stack, which you can use to evaluate and learn about Azure Stack.  You can also use the Azure Stack Development Kit as a developer environment, where you can develop using consistent APIs and tooling.  

You should be aware of these points with Azure Stack Development Kit:

* Azure Stack Development Kit must not be used as a production environment and should only be used for testing, evaluation, and demonstration.  
* Your deployment of Azure Stack is associated with a single Azure Active Directory or Active Directory Federation Services identity provider. You can create multiple users in this directory and assign subscriptions to each user.
* With all components deployed on the single machine, there are limited physical resources available for tenant resources. This configuration is not intended for scale or performance evaluation.
* Networking scenarios are limited due to the single host/NIC requirement.
