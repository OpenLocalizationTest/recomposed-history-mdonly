# Deploy apps with a hybrid CI/CD pipeline:  Create the pipeline & deploy
This topic is part three on building a hybrid CI/CD pipeline, and provides the steps on how to create the build & release definitions that publish to Azure.  If you already have a working CI/CD pipeline that publishes to Azure, you can review the steps below for any differences and then move on to part four to configure publishing to Azure Stack.

## Configure build definition
The build process defines how your application will be built and packaged for deployment when new code is introduced. In our example, we'll use a the included template to configure the build process for the ASP.NET app, though this could be adapted depending on your application.

1.  Sign-in to your VSTS workspace from a web browser.
2.  From the banner, select **Build & Release**  and then **Builds**.
3.  Click **+ New**
4.  From the list of templates, select **ASP.NET (Preview)** and select **Next**.
5.  You can select the defaults for repository source if this is your first project, or if not, select the appropriate repository.  Check the box for **Continuous Integration**, which tells VSTS to create a build any time changes are committed to the master branch.
6. <Fix this - add step depending on release steps>

## Configure release definition
The release defines how builds from the previous step are deployed to each environment.  In this case, we'll be using FTP publishing with App Service to Azure, and we'll be configuring Azure Stack in part four. To configure a release to Azure, use the following steps:

1.  Sign-in to your VSTS workspace from a web bowser.
2.  From the banner, select **Build & Release**  and then **Releases**.
3.  Click the green **+**, and select **Create a new release**. 
4.  Select **Empty** and click **Next**
5.  You can select the defaults if this is your first build & release in this environment, or select the build created in the previous steps.  Check the box for *Continuous deployment*, and then click **Create**

Now that you've created an empty release definition and tied it to the build, we'll add steps for the Azure environment:

1.  Click the green + to add tasks.
2.  From the list, select in this order:
    <Fix this - Steps TBD on feedback>

3.  <Fix this - Configure each step with these settings

## Deploy your app to Azure
To see the power of a CI/CD pipeline, you will publish your app to Azure.  

1.  From the banner in VSTS, select **Build & Release**, and then select **Builds**.
2.  Click the **...** on the build definition previously created, and select **Queue new build**
3.  Accept the defaults and click **Ok**.  The build will now begin and display progress.
4.  Once the build beings, a console window will begin logging information
