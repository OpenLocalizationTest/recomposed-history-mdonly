# Monitor health and alerts in Azure Stack
Microsoft Azure Stack Technical Preview 2 introduces new infrastructure monitoring capabilities that enables you, the cloud administrator, to view health and alerts for an Azure Stack region.

This preview release of Azure Stack introduces a set of region management capabilities available in the **Region Management** tile. The Region Management tile, pinned by default for members of the admin subscription, lists all the deployed regions of Azure Stack and the counts of active critical and warning alerts for each region. This is your entry point into the health and alert functionality of Azure Stack.

 ## Understand health in Azure Stack

 Health and alerts are managed in Azure Stack by the Health resource provider. Azure Stack infrastructure components register with the Health resource provider during Azure Stack deployment and configuration for the purposes of displaying health and alerts. Health in Azure Stack is a simple concept. If alerts for a registered instance of a component exist, the health state of that component reflects the worst active alert severity, warning or critical.
 
 You can view the health state of components in both the Azure Stack portal as well as through Rest API and PowerShell. In the TP2 release, you can view the health state of infrastructure roles. However, the only infrastructure role reporting alerts and health is the Health controller. In future releases, other infrastructure roles will surface alerts and report health.

## View alerts

The list of active alerts for each Azure Stack region is available directly from the Region Management blade.  The first tile in the default configuration is the Alerts tile which displays a summary of the critical and warning alerts for the region. The Alerts tile, like any other tile on this blade, can be pinned to the dashboard for quick access.

By selecting the **Alerts** tile you will navigate to the list of all active alerts for the region. If you select either the **Critical** or **Warning** line item within the tile, you will navigate to a filtered list of alerts (Critical or Warning).

The Alerts blade supports the ability to filter both on status (active or closed) and severity (critical or warning). The default view displays all Active alerts. All closed alerts are removed from the system after seven days.

The Alerts list blade also exposes an action called **View API** which displays the Rest API used to generate the list view. This provides a quick way to become familiar with the Rest APIs that you can use to query alerts for use in automation or integration with your existing datacenter monitoring, reporting, and ticketing solutions.

From the alert list blade, you can select an alert to navigate to the **Alert Details** blade. The alert detail blade displays all the fields associated with the alert and allows for quick navigation to the affected component and source of the alert. The alert displayed below will fire if one of the infrastructure role instances goes offline or is inaccessible. After the infrastructure role instance is back online, this alert will close automatically.

Now that you know more about health and viewing alerts in Azure Stack, itâ€™s time to learn more about how to update Azure Stack.
