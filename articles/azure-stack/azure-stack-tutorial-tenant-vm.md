# Make virtual machines available to your Azure Stack users
As an Azure Stack administrator, you can create offers that your users (sometimes referred to as tenants) can subscribe to. Using their subscription, users can then consumer Azure Stack services. For example they can then add a virtual machine or whatever else you make available in your offer.

In Azure Stack, services are delivered to users using subscriptions, offers, and plans. Users can subscribe to multiple offers. Offers can have one or more plans, and plans can have one or more services.

To learn more, see [Key features and concepts in Azure Stack](azure-stack-key-features.md).

## Create an offer

Now you can get things ready for your users. You will create an offer that they can then subscribe to.
1. [Set quotas](azure-stack-setting-quotas.md).

    Quotas define the limits of resources that a tenant subscription can provision or consume. For example, a quota might allow a tenant to create up to five VMs. To add a service to a plan, the administrator must configure the quota settings for that service.

2. [Create a plan](azure-stack-create-plan.md).

    Plans are groupings of one or more services. As a provider, you can create plans to offer to your users. In turn, your users subscribe to your offers to use the plans and services they include.

3. [Create an offer](azure-stack-create-offer.md).

    Offers are groups of one or more plans that providers present to users to purchase or subscribe to.

## Add an image

Before you can provision virtual machines, you must add an image to the Azure Stack marketplace. This example shows you how to add a Windows Server 2016 image, but you can add the image of your choice, including Linux images.

For more information see [The Azure Stack Marketplace](azure-stack-marketplace.md).

> [!NOTE]
> This step can take almost an hour to complete!

[Add the Windows Server 2016 VM image to the Azure Stack marketplace](azure-stack-add-default-image.md)


## Test the offer

Now that youâ€™ve created an offer, you can test it. Log in as a user and subscribe to the offer and then add a virtual machine.

If you deployed using AD FS, you need to create a user account first. If you deployed using Azure Active Directory, you already created a user account following the guidance in [Azure Stack deployment prerequisites](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-stack/azure-stack-deploy#azure-active-directory-accounts).

1. [Add users in the Azure Stack POC](azure-stack-add-users-adfs.md) (AD FS deployments only).

    If you have an AD FS deployment, create a user account (for example Contoso):

    

2. [Subscribe to an offer](azure-stack-subscribe-plan-provision-vm.md).

   Now you can login to the portal as a user to subscribe to an offer.


3. [Provision a virtual machine](azure-stack-provision-vm.md).

   Now you can log in to the portal as a user to provision a virtual machine using the subscription. 

   To test that this works with a user account, follow the article, but log in with a user account instead of an administrator account. 

## Next steps
In this tutorial you've learned how to create an offer and verified that users can subscribe to the offer to start using resources on Azure Stack. Next, you can Deploy apps to Azure & Azure Stack.
