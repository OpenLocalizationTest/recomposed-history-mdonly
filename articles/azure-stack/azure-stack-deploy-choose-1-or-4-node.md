# Choose your Azure Stack TP2 deployment option

You can choose between two configurations for your Azure Stack deployment: a one-node configuration or a four-node configuration. 

## One-node configuration

A one-node configuration is deployed on a single server and offers:

- easier setup
- a small hardware footprint 

Use a one-node configuration:
- as a basic development and test environment
- to get a feel for the user interface and API 

To deploy a 1-node Azure Stack environment:

1. [Confirm the one-node hardware requirements](azure-stack-deploy-1node-hardware-reqs.md)

2. [Prepare the one-node environment](azure-stack-deploy-1node-prepare.md)

3. [Deploy the one-node Azure Stack environment](azure-stack-deploy-1node-deploy.md)

## Four-node configuration

A four-node configuration is deployed on four servers and offers:

- a more scalable system with more resource capacity for tenant workloads
- a complete test environment for your virtualized workloads and hybrid cloud apps
- the ability to evaluate your application performance profiles on top Azure Stack

Use a four-node configuration to:

- test your tenant workloads or your own private cloud services in an Azure Stack solution
- deploy multiple workloads
- experiment with a fuller set of Azure Stack capabilities as a platform 

To deploy a four-node Azure Stack environment:

1. [Confirm the four-node hardware requirements](azure-stack-deploy-4node-hardware-reqs.md)

2. [Prepare the four-node environment](azure-stack-deploy-4node-prepare.md)

3. [Deploy the one-node Azure Stack environment](azure-stack-deploy-4node-deploy.md)
