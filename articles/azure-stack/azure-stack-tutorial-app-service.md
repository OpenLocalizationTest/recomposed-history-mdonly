# Give Azure Stack users the ability to create web, mobile, and API apps

If your tenants want to create web, mobile, or API applications, you must add an App Service Resource Provider to your Azure Stack deployment. You can then create an offer that includes App Service and have tenants subscribe to it, so they can create their apps. To set this up, follow these steps (it will take a couple hours to install and for all the worker roles to appear):

## Prepare the POC host

1. Confirm that your Azure Stack POC host meets the requirements for the App Service resource provider:
    - Azure Stack Technical Preview 3.
    - 20 GB of free disk space for a small deployment of the App Service resource provider.
2. You must use the PowerShell Integrated Scripting Environment (ISE) as an administrator, which requires that you [turn off Internet enhanced security](azure-stack-app-service-before-you-get-started.md#turn-off-internet-explorer-enhanced-security) and [enable cookies](azure-stack-app-service-before-you-get-started.md#enable-cookies).
3. [Install PowerShell for Azure Stack](azure-stack-powershell-install.md) and [install Visual Studio](azure-stack-install-visual-studio.md).
4. [Add a Windows Server 2016 virtual machine image](azure-stack-add-default-image.md) to the Azure Stack marketplace so that App Service can create virtual machines required for the App Service deployment.
5. [Install the SQL Server resource provider](azure-stack-sql-resource-provider-deploy.md) (App Service will use the default database). Make note of the database administrator username and password, which youâ€™ll need later when you deploy App Service.

## Deploy the App Service resource provider on the POC host

1.	[Download the installer and helper scripts](azure-stack-app-service-deploy.md#download-the-required-components).
2.	[Run the helper script to create required certificates](azure-stack-app-service-deploy.md#create-certificates-required-by-app-service-on-azure-stack).
3.	[Install the App Service resource provider](azure-stack-app-service-deploy.md#use-the-installer-to-download-and-install-app-service-on-azure-stack).
4.	[Validate the installation](azure-stack-app-service-deploy.md#validate-app-service-on-azure-stack-installation).

## Create an offer that includes App Service

As an example, you can create an offer that lets users create DotNetNuke web content management systems. It requires the SQL Server service which you already enabled by installing the SQL Server resource provider.

1.	[Set a quota](azure-stack-setting-quotas.md) and name it *AppServiceQuota*. Select **Microsoft.Web** for the **Namespace** field.
2.	[Create a plan](azure-stack-create-plan.md). Name it *TestAppServicePlan*, select the the **Microsoft.SQL** service, and **AppService Quota** quota.

> [!NOTE]
> To let users create other apps, other services might be required in the plan. For example, Azure Functions requires that the plan include the **Microsoft.Storage** service, while Wordpress requires **Microsoft.MySQL**.

3.	[Create an offer](azure-stack-create-offer.md) and select the **TestAppServicePlan** plan.

## As a tenant, create an app in Azure Stack
