# Get started with Azure Stack Storage development tools 

Microsoft Azure Stack provides a set of the storage services including Blob, Table and, Queue.

This article provides quick guidance on how to get started with Azure Stack Storage using development tools. More detailed information and sample code can be found in the corresponding Azure Storage tutorials.

There are known differences between Azure Storage and Azure Stack Storage, including some specific requirements for each platform. For example, there are specific client libraries and specific endpoint suffix requirements for Azure Stack. For more information, see [Azure Stack storage: differences and considerations](azure-stack-acs-differences.md#azure-client-library).
