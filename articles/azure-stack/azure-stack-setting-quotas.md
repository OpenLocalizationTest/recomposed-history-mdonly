#Setting quotas in Azure Stack

Quotas define the limits of resources that a tenant subscription
can provision or consume. For example, a quota may allow a tenant to
create up to five VMs. To add a service to a plan, the
administrator must configure the quota settings for that service.

Quotas are configurable per service and per location, allowing the administrator to provide granular control over the resource
consumption. An administrator can create one or more quota
resources and associate them with plans, allowing them to provide
differentiated offerings for their services. Quotas for a given service can be created 
from the Resource Provider administration blade for that service. 

A tenant that subscribes to an offer containing multiple
plans can use all resources available in each plan.

##To create an IaaS quota:

1.  In an internet browser, navigate to
    [https://portal.azurestack.local](https://portal.azurestack.local/).
    
    Sign in to the Azure Stack portal as an administrator (using the credentials you provided during deployment). 

2.  Click **New** then **Quota**.

3.  Select the first service for which you want to create a quota. For an IaaS quota, you need to follow these steps for each of Compute, Network, and Storage.
In this example, we first create a quota for the Compute Service, so select the **Microsoft.Compute.Admin** namespace from the **Namespace** list.

4.  Choose the location where the quota is defined (for example, 'local').

5.  On the **Quota Settings** item, you see it says **Set the
    Capacity of Quota**. Click this item to configure the quota settings.

6.  On the Set Quotas blade, you see all the Compute resources for which
    you can configure limits. Each type has a default
    value associated with it. You can change these values if you choose,
    or click the **Ok** button at the bottom of the blade to accept
    the defaults.

7.  Once you have configured the values and clicked **Ok**, the **Quota
    Settings** item now appears as **Configured**. Click **Ok** to
    create the **Quota** resource.

    You should see a notification indicating that the quota resource is
    being created.

8.   Once the Quota set has been successfully created, you receive a second notification. The Compute service quota is now ready to be associated with a
    Plan. Repeat these steps with the Network and Storage services and you are ready to create an IaaS plan!

##Compute Quota Types

|**Type**                    |**Default Value**| **Description**|
