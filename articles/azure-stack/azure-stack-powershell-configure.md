# Configure PowerShell for use with Azure Stack 

You can use PowerShell to connect to an Azure Stack environment. After connecting, you can manage and deploy Azure Stack resources. You can use the steps described in this article either from MAS-CON01, the Azure Stack host computer, or a Windows-based external client if you are connected through VPN. The steps in this article are applicable for Azure Stack instances deployed through Azure Active Directory(AAD) or Active Directory Federation Services(ADFS). 

## Prerequisites
* [Install Azure Stack compatible Azure PowerShell on MAS-CON01 or on your local computer.](azure-stack-powershell-install.md)  
* [Download tools required to work with Azure Stack to MAS-CON01 or to your local computer.](azure-stack-powershell-download.md)  

## Import the Connect PowerShell module

After downloading the tools, navigate to the downloaded folder and import the **Connect** PowerShell module by running the following command in an elevated PowerShell session:  
```PowerShell
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted
Import-Module .\Connect\AzureStack.Connect.psm1
```

## Configure the PowerShell Environment
Use the following steps to configure your Azure Stack environment:

1. Register an AzureRM environment that targets your Azure Stack instance by using one of the following cmdlets:  
   a. To access the **administrative portal**

   ```PowerShell
   Add-AzureStackAzureRmEnvironment `
     -Name "AzureStackAdmin" `
     -ArmEndpoint "https://adminmanagement.local.azurestack.external"
   ```

   b. To access the **user portal**

   ```PowerShell
   Add-AzureStackAzureRmEnvironment `
     -Name "AzureStackUser" `
     -ArmEndpoint "https://management.local.azurestack.external" 
   ```
   Following screen shot shows the output of the previous cmdlet:

2. Get the GUID value of the Active Directory(AD) tenant that is used to deploy the Azure Stack. If your Azure Stack environment is deployed by using:  

   a. **Azure Active Directory**, use one of the following cmdlets:
   
   * **Administrative environment**
     ```PowerShell
     $TenantID = Get-DirectoryTenantID `
       -AADTenantName "<myDirectoryTenantName>.onmicrosoft.com" `
       -EnvironmentName AzureStackAdmin
     ```

   * **User environemnt**
     ```PowerShell
     $TenantID = Get-DirectoryTenantID `
       -AADTenantName "<myDirectoryTenantName>.onmicrosoft.com" `
       -EnvironmentName AzureStackUser
     ```

   b. **Active Directory Federation Services**, use one of the following cmdlets:
   
   * **Administrative environment**
     ```PowerShell
     $TenantID = Get-DirectoryTenantID `
       -ADFS `
       -EnvironmentName AzureStackAdmin
     ```

   * **User environemnt**
     ```PowerShell 
     $TenantID = Get-DirectoryTenantID `
       -ADFS `
       -EnvironmentName AzureStackUser 
     ```

## Sign in to Azure Stack

After the AzureRM environment is registered to target the Azure Stack instance, you can use all the AzureRM commands in your Azure Stack environment. Use the following steps to sign in your Azure Stack environment:

1. Store the administrator or user account's credentials in a variable:

   ```PowerShell
   $UserName='<Azure Active Directory service administrator or user account name>'
   $Password='<Azure Active Directory service administrator or user password>'| `
     ConvertTo-SecureString -Force -AsPlainText
   $Credential= New-Object PSCredential($UserName,$Password)
   ```

2. Use the one of the following cmdlets to sign in to either the Azure Stack administrator or user account:

   a. To sign in to the **administrative portal**

   ```powershell
   Login-AzureRmAccount `
     -EnvironmentName "AzureStackAdmin" `
     -TenantId $TenantID `
     -Credential $Credential
   ```

   b. To sign in to the **user portal**

   ```powershell
   Login-AzureRmAccount `
     -EnvironmentName "AzureStackUser" `
     -TenantId $TenantID `
     -Credential $Credential
   ```

## Register resource providers 

After you sign in to the administrator or user portal, you can issue operations against resource providers registered in that subscription. By default, all the foundational resource providers are registered in the **Default Provider Subscription(administrator subscription)**. When operating on a newly created user subscription, which doesnâ€™t have any resources deployed through the portal, you should register the resource providers for this subscription by using the following command:

```PowerShell
  Get-AzureRmResourceProvider `
    -ListAvailable 
```

In the user subscriptions, you should manually register these resource providers before you use them. To register providers on the current subscription, use the following command:

```PowerShell
Register-AllAzureRmProviders
```

![registering PowerShell](media/azure-stack-powershell-configure/registeringrps.png)  

To register all resource providers on all your subscriptions, use the following command:

```PowerShell
Register-AllAzureRmProvidersOnAllSubscriptions
```
