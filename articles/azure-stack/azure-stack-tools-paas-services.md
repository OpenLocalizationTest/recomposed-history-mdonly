# Tools and PaaS services for Azure Stack

## Overview
Azure Stack will allow hosting Platform as a Service (PaaS) services from Azure and other providers. This page will contain the latest PaaS services from Microsoft Azure that can deploy on Azure Stack, as well as tools to that will help build these services, interact with them and unlock the full potential of having them in your local Azure Stack.
Make sure you visit this page often as new Azure services get unlocked for Azure Stack preview.

## Additional PaaS Services
Very soon, we will enable hosting Azure Web Apps on Azure Stack as well as some supporting PaaS services to serve as a web app data tier.

## Template Tools
### Azure Stack Github Templates
Explore the growing collection of [Azure Stack GitHub Templates](https://github.com/Azure/AzureStack-QuickStart-Templates). Just like [Azure](https://github.com/Azure/azure-quickstart-templates), these “Quick Start” Azure Resource Manager templates aim to get you started with simple building blocks and examples, ready to deploy on the Microsoft Azure Stack Technical Preview Proof of Concept Environment. Included are first party workload examples for [ad-non-ha](https://github.com/Azure/AzureStack-QuickStart-Templates/tree/master/ad-non-ha),[sql-2014-non-ha](https://github.com/Azure/AzureStack-QuickStart-Templates/tree/master/sql-2014-non-ha), [sharepoint-2013-non-ha](https://github.com/Azure/AzureStack-QuickStart-Templates/tree/master/sharepoint-2013-non-ha), as well as several simple 101 templates like [101-simple-windows-vm](https://github.com/Azure/AzureStack-QuickStart-Templates/tree/master/101-simple-windows-vm).


### Marketplace Item Packaging Tool and Sample
[Download and use the Packaging tool](http://www.aka.ms/azurestackmarketplaceitem) to create marketplace items for your own custom templates to add to the Azure Stack marketplace.
