# Add the Windows Server 2016 VM image to the Azure Stack marketplace

By default, there aren’t any virtual machine images available in the Azure Stack marketplace. The Azure Stack cloud administrator must add an image to the marketplace before users can use them. You can add the Windows Server 2016 image to the Azure Stack marketplace by using one of the following two methods:

* [Add the image by downloading it from the Azure Marketplace](#add-the-image-by-downloading-it-from-the-Azure-marketplace) - Use this option if you are operating in a connected scenario and if you have registered your Azure Stack instance with Azure.

* [Add the image by using PowerShell](#add-the-image-by-using-powershell) - Use this option if you have deployed Azure Stack in a disconnected scenario or in scenarios with limited connectivity.

## Add the image by downloading it from the Azure Marketplace

1. After deploying Azure Stack, sign in to your Azure Stack Development Kit.

2. click **More services** > **Marketplace Management** > **Add from Azure** 

3. Find or search for the **Windows Server 2016 Datacenter – Eval** image > click **Download**

After the download completes, the image is added to the **Marketplace Management** blade and it is also made available from the **Virtual Machines** blade.

## Add the image by using PowerShell

1. After deploying Azure Stack, sign in to your Azure Stack Development Kit.

2. Go to https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-windows-server-2016 and download the Windows Server 2016 evaluation. When prompted, select the **ISO** version of the download. Record the path to the download location, which is used later in these steps. This step requires internet connectivity.

3. Open PowerShell ISE as an administrator.

4. [Install PowerShell for Azure Stack](azure-stack-powershell-install.md).

5. [Download the Azure Stack tools from GitHub](azure-stack-powershell-download.md). Make sure that you download and extract the Azure Stack tool repository to a folder that is NOT under the C:\Windows\System32 directory.  
   
6. Import the Azure Stack Connect and ComputeAdmin modules by using the following commands:

   ```powershell
   Import-Module .\Connect\AzureStack.Connect.psm1
   Import-Module .\ComputeAdmin\AzureStack.ComputeAdmin.psm1
   ```
7. Create the Azure Stack cloud administrator's AzureRM environment by using the following cmdlet:

   ```powershell
   Add-AzureStackAzureRmEnvironment `
     -Name "AzureStackAdmin" `
     -ArmEndpoint "https://adminmanagement.local.azurestack.external" 
   ```

8. Get the GUID value of the Active Directory(AD) tenant that is used to deploy the Azure Stack. If your Azure Stack environment is deployed by using:  

    a. **Azure Active Directory**, use the following cmdlet:
    
    ```PowerShell
    $TenantID = Get-AzsDirectoryTenantId `
      -AADTenantName "<myDirectoryTenantName>.onmicrosoft.com" `
      -EnvironmentName AzureStackAdmin
    ```
    b. **Active Directory Federation Services**, use the following cmdlet:
    
    ```PowerShell
    $TenantID = Get-AzsDirectoryTenantId `
      -ADFS 
      -EnvironmentName AzureStackAdmin 
    ```
   
9. Add the Windows Server 2016 image to the Azure Stack marketplace by running the `New-AzsServer2016VMImage` cmdlet. Replace *Path_to_ISO* with the path to the WS2016 ISO you downloaded. See the [Parameters](#parameters) section for information about the allowed parameters.

   ```powershell
   $ISOPath = "<Fully_Qualified_Path_to_ISO>"

   # Add a Windows Server 2016 Evaluation VM Image.
   New-AzsServer2016VMImage `
     -ISOPath $ISOPath
   ```
   To ensure that the Windows Server 2016 VM image has the latest cumulative update, include the `IncludeLatestCU` parameter when running the previous cmdlet. It takes about an hour to publish the image to the Azure Stack marketplace.

## Parameters

|New-AzsServer2016VMImage parameters|Required?|Description|
|-----|-----|------|
|ISOPath|Yes|The fully qualified path to the downloaded Windows Server 2016 ISO.|
|Net35|No|This parameter allows you to install the .NET 3.5 runtime on the Windows Server 2016 image. By default, this value is set to true. It is mandatory that the image contains the .NET 3.5 runtime to install the SQL and MYSQL resource providers. |
|Version|No|This parameter allows you to choose whether to add a **Core** or **Full** or **Both** Windows Server 2016 images. By default, this value is set to "Full."|
|VHDSizeInMB|No|Sets the size (in MB) of the VHD image to be added to your Azure Stack environment. By default, this value is set to 40960 MB.|
|CreateGalleryItem|No|Specifies if a Marketplace item should be created for the Windows Server 2016 image. By default, this value is set to true.|
|location |No |Specifies the location to which the Windows Server 2016 image should be published.|
|IncludeLatestCU|No|Set this switch to apply the latest Windows Server 2016 cumulative update to the new VHD.|
|CUUri |No |Set this value to choose the Windows Server 2016 cumulative update from a specific URI. |
|CUPath |No |Set this value to choose the Windows Server 2016 cumulative update from a local path. This option is helpful if you have deployed the Azure Stack instance in a disconnected environment.|
