# Overview: Microsoft Azure Stack

Microsoft Azure Stack is a cloud-optimized hybrid application platform which employs a collection of Microsoft Azure technologies that let you offer a rich, self-service, multi-tenant cloud, consistent with the Microsoft Azure experience. It gives you the power of Azure and the control of a datacenter, enabling you to offer Infrastructure-as-a-Service services to tenants.

Microsoft Azure Stack brings proven innovation from Microsoft’s hyper-scale public cloud (Azure) into your datacenter. For more information about Microsoft Azure, visit [www.Azure.com](http://www.Azure.com).

>[AZURE.NOTE] Some of these features will come at different times of the preview cycle and may not be available at TP1.

## Develop once, deploy anywhere

You can build and deploy your application the same way regardless of whether it runs on Azure or Azure Stack. Using the same Azure APIs, you can develop an application once and, using Azure Resource Manager templates, deploy it to both Microsoft Azure and to an Azure Stack private or hosted datacenter. Developing with familiar tools, such as Linux, Java, and PHP (as they become available in Microsoft Azure Stack), you can use the same Azure Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) and Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) services.

Use Azure Virtual Machines, Virtual Network, and Storage to run traditional applications like SQL Server or SharePoint Server. Or write cloud-native applications with Azure services such as Web Apps and containers provisioned and managed by Docker.

In addition, you have access to a single marketplace for thousands of certified, open source and community software applications and add-ons. Content designed for Azure will also work with Azure Stack, such as Azure Resource Manager templates, Windows Server/Linux virtual machine images, or third-party services.

All of this grants application owners unprecedented development agility and productivity.

## IT flexibility and control

With Azure Stack, you can run Azure services in your datacenter for true hybrid cloud agility. Azure Stack delivers a new cloud-inspired infrastructure and platform as a service that enables you to accelerate your organization’s cloud transformation. Scale your resources running on Azure Stack at busy times of the year, for dev/test, or whenever you need them.

Enjoy unmatched agility and productivity, with the flexibility, oversight, and control to keep sensitive data and applications onsite. You decide where to keep your data and applications. Got sensitive data? Put it on-premises or with a trusted hosting service provider.

With integrated IT and business processes, you have complete command and control of configuration, provisioning, and updating. Using Azure Resource Manager, you can manage pools of resources and resource groups in both the public cloud and your datacenter. Use role-based control to restrict access for enhanced security.
