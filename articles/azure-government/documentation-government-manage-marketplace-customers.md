# Azure Marketplace for Government
The Azure Markplace is available for Azure Government with an updated list of images from our marketplace partners. 

## Varations
Below are some considerations when using Azure Marketplace for Government:

- Only Bring Your Own License (BYOL) images are available. You cannot access any images that require purchase transaction through Azure Marketplace
- Only a subset of images is currently available as compared to the public marketplace. You can find the list of available images [here](../azure-government-image-gallery.md) 

>[AZURE.NOTE] If you are interested in making your images available in Azure Goverment please refer to [partners onbaording guidelines](documentation-government-manage-marketplace-partners.md) for more information.

### Step 1
Launch the Marketplace
