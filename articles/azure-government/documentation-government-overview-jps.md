#  Justice and Public Safety (JPS) in Azure Government

## Overview

Justice and Public Safety (JPS) agencies are under mounting pressure to keep communities safe, reduce crime, and improve responsiveness. From intelligent policing awareness systems, body camera systems across the country, to day-to-day mobile police collaboration, cloud computing is transforming the way law enforcement agencies approach their work.

When properly planned and secured, cloud services can deliver powerful new capabilities for JPS, including digital evidence management, data analysis, and real-time decision support – with solutions delivered on the latest ruggedized mobile devices. Yet not all cloud providers are created equal. As law enforcement agencies embrace the cloud, they need a cloud service provider they can trust.  The core of the law enforcement mission demands partners committed to meeting a full range of security and operational needs.

From the device to the cloud, Microsoft puts privacy and security of information first, all while increasing productivity for officers in the field and throughout the department. Combining highly secure, ruggedized devices with anytime, anywhere access to the cloud means that JPS agencies can contribute to ongoing investigations, analyze data, manage evidence, and help protect citizens from threats.

Microsoft is the only hyper-scale cloud provider in the U.S. that has contractually committed to the FBI’s Criminal Justice Information Services Security Policy (CJIS). This factor is one of the primary reasons why agencies have chosen solutions built on Microsoft Azure Government.
