#  Department of Defense (DoD) in Azure Government

## Overview

Azure Government is being used by more and more Department of Defense (DoD) agencies and associated organizations, to deploy an ever-growing range of workloads and solutions, including those workloads covered by <a href="http://iasecontent.disa.mil/cloud/SRG/index.html"> The DoD Cloud Computing Security Requirements Guide, Version 1, Release 2 </a> at Impact Level 4 (L4).

Azure Government is a key component in one of the largest commercial cloud contracts in DoD history.  This contract provides new cloud-based solutions for the DoD enabling better productivity and collaboration at reduced cost.

One of the key drivers for the DoD in moving to the cloud is to enable organizations to focus on their core missions and to minimize the distractions of building and managing in-house IT solutions.

The two key benefits of the Azure Government-based cloud architecture are enabling personnel to focus on mission rather than managing IT commodities such as SharePoint, and realigning critical resources to cyber mission areas.

It is the elasticity and flexibility delivered by the hyperscale architecture of Azure that provides  enormous benefits to DoD customers. It is much simpler, quicker and more cost-effective to scale-up a workload in the cloud than it is to go through traditional hardware and services procurement processes when working on-premises, or in DoD data centers. For example, to procure new multi-server hardware, even for a test environment, may take many months, and require the approval of significant capital expenditure; by contrast, using Azure, a test migration for an existing workload can be configured in weeks or even days, and in a cost-effective manner (when the test is over, the environment can be torn down with no ongoing costs).

This flexibility is significant; by moving to Azure, DoD customers do not just save money; the cloud delivers new opportunities. For example, it is easy to spin up a test environment to gain insights into new technologies, you can migrate application and test it in Azure before committing to a production deployment in the cloud. Mission owners can explore options cheaply and easily, and without risk.

Security is another key area, and although any cloud deployment will require proper planning to ensure secure and reliable service delivery, in reality most properly configured cloud-based workloads (up to and including L4 workloads) in Azure Government will be more secure than many traditional deployments in DoD locations and data centers. This is because, although defense agencies have the experience and expertise to physically secure all assets, IT surface areas present significantly different challenges; cyber security is a very rapidly changing space, requiring specialist skills and the ability to rapidly develop and deployment counter-measures as required. The Azure platform, both commercial and Government, now supports hundreds of thousands of customers, and this scale enables Microsoft to quickly detect evolving attack vectors, and then direct its resources onto rapid development and implementation of the appropriate defenses.
