#  Protecting Customer Data by Managing Secrets
![alt text](./media/azure-government-us-cloud.PNG)

Secure key management is essential for protecting data in the cloud. Customers should strive to simplify key management and maintain control of keys used by cloud applications and services to encrypt data.

## <a name="Overview"></a>Best Practices

* Use Key Vault to minimize the risks of secrets being exposed through hard-coded configuration files, scripts, or in source code. Azure Key Vault encrypts keys (such as the encryption keys for Azure Disk Encryption) and secrets (such as passwords), by storing them in FIPS 140-2 Level 2 validated hardware security modules (HSMs). For added assurance, you can import or generate keys in these HSMs.
* Application code and templates should only contain URI references to the secrets (which means the actual secrets are not in code, configuration or source code repositories). This prevents key phishing attacks on internal or external repos, such as harvest-bots in GitHub.
* Utilize strong RBAC controls within Key Vault. If a trusted operator leaves the company or transfers to a new group within the company, they should be prevented from being able to access the secrets.
