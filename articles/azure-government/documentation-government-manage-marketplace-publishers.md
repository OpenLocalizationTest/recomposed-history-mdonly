##  Overview

## Variations
The Marketplace Service is available to the Azure Government with ISV provided images. These images have the below attributes.
- Only Bring Your Own License (BYOL) SKUs are available. This means you cannot access any images that require purchase transaction through Azure Marketplace
- Only a subset of images are currently available as compared to the public marketplace. You can find the list of available images here -> point to image page from here

The provisioning experience in the Azure Portal will be similar to the Marketplace experience on public Azure. The provisioning flow is detailed below.
