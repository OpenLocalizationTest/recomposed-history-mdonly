# Azure Government Cybersecurity: Monitoring and securing your assets with Operations Management Suite (OMS)

## Cybersecurity in the Cloud
A crucial aspect for our customers moving to the Cloud is retaining could asset management and security of your Azure Government services that you have deployed to the Cloud. Virtual Machines firewalls need to be configured correctly. The Virtual Networks need to have the right Network Security Groups applied to them. Access to your assets needs to be locked down to the right people at the right time. All of this are necessary work streams that needs to be planned, designed, and provisioned to enable a secure infrastructure for your agency to use.

Setting up such an environment can be challenging. Onboarding your fleet of servers to any monitoring service is hard to scale as well as update. Monitoring infrastructure on different cloud providers as well as across the Cloud and on-premises is difficult. Lastly keeping your monitoring up to date and enabling insights to monitor, detect, alert, and action against cybersecurity threats requires time, resources, and compute power.

## Microsoft Operations Management Suite (OMS)
Microsoft Operations Management Suite – now available in Azure Government – is a service that enables you to do all of these things leveraging the power of map reduce and machine learning as a service. OMS can:
* Deploy agents to individual VMS (Linux and Windows) on Azure, other cloud providers, and/or on-premises.
* Connect your existing logs via an Azure Government Storage Account or SCOM endpoint with existing logging data.
* Run evergreen machine learning and map reduce services powered by hyper-scale log search to expose threats in your environment out-of-the-box.

Let's explore how we can get OMS integrated into your fleet and some of the out-of-box solutions that can address the above points.

## Onboarding servers to OMS
The first thing to integrating your Cloud assets with Operations Management Suite is installing the OMS agent across your sources of logs.
For Virtual Machines this is very simple – you can manually download the agent from your OMS workspace.

You can connect Azure VMs to OMS directly through the Portal. Instructions [here](https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/momteam/2016/02/10/new-ways-to-enable-log-analytics-oms-on-your-azure-vms/).
You can also connect them programmatically and/or configure the OMS extension right into your Azure Resource Manager (ARM) templates. Instructions for Windows’ based machine [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-windows-agents) and Linux [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/log-analytics/log-analytics-linux-agents).

## Onboarding Storage Accounts and SCOM to OMS
OMS can also connect to your Storage Account and/or existing SCOM 2013 deployments to offer you operations management in hybrid scenarios (across cloud providers or in cloud/on-prem infrastructures).

OMS also supports logging information from other monitoring services like Chef and/or Puppet. Furthermore, for Azure deployments – we also have VMs with OMS enabled ARM templates so you can deploy Compute and onboard to your OMS workspace at the same time.

Information on setting up OMS with your existing SCOM implementation on premises can be found here.
Leveraging intelligence through OMS Solution Packs.
Now that you have various sources of logging data there arises a separate problem – making sense of all this data.
OMS, at its’ core, is a log search service that lets you write powerful queries to very quickly search across thousands or even millions of logs. However, discovering the issues that you need to write queries for is very difficult.
Enter OMS solutions – packs of queries integrated natively with OMS map reduce and machine learning tech to proactively give you insights into your OMS managed fleet.
Along the theme of cyber security – I’ll briefly discuss three cybersecurity scenarios that OMS can solve out-of-the-box for you.
Antimalware Assessment
Antimalware Assessments gives you a pre-canned set of queries, notifications, and monitoring dashboards to give you, at glance, how well your fleet is protected against malware.
This dashboard gives you 4 things:
-	Any servers that have active and/or remediated threats.
-	Currently detected threats
-	Computers that aren’t being sufficiently protected. OMS does this by crawling the logs of your computers and look for any site of FWs being opened and/or improperly configured rules in common web browsers.
-	Analysis on how your protected servers are being protected. For example – by native Windows OS virus protection and/or something like System Center Endpoint Protection.
For example, below – you can see a threat was caught and automatically triaged by Systems Center:

Identity and Access
Another common cybersecurity scenario in the Cloud is in credential compromise. Not only does your cloud subscription have credentials – but each individual VM has a user and/or secret (usually a certificate and/or password) associated with it.
OMS will sum and organize all login attempts in your fleet and bucket them depending on type (remote, local, username used etc.)
For example – in the below – I can see a mass amount of unsuccessful login attempts from largely random strings as usernames. This most likely points to my computers being exposed and not properly protected by firewalls and access control lists.

Threat Intelligence
OMS also provides protection against malicious insider scenarios – where there’s a security compromise inside your organization and a malicious user is trying to ex-filtrate data.
OMS Threat Intelligence looks at all your Network logs on your computer and automatically searches and notifies you on inbound/outbound network connections to known malicious IPs (for example – IP addresses on the unindexed dark net).
For example, below – I can see there are both inbound and outbound network connections to the People’s Republic of China. 
Double clicking on the inbound tag – I can find out that a Linux VM that is being managed by OMS is making outbound connections to a known dark net IP in China.
You can also setup Alerts to OMS Solutions like Threat Intelligence. Below I’ve setup an Alert so should OMS detect > 10 outbound connections to a known malicious IP it sends an alert out to me via email. I then configure that alert to fire an Azure Automation job which is setup to automatically shut down that VM.

This is just one example of an out-of-box OMS solution that can be applied to your fleet, whether it’s running on Azure, another cloud service provider, or on your premises.
OMS will continue to update its machine learning to the latest threats automatically for you and we continue to roll out new Solutions to the OMS Solution Gallery as well.
