#  Principles for Securing Customer Data in Azure Government

Azure Government provides a range of features and services that you can use to build cloud solutions to meet your regulated/controlled data needs. A compliant customer solution is nothing more than the effective implementation of out-of-the-box Azure Government capabilities, coupled with a solid data security practice.
When you host a solution in Azure Government, Microsoft handles many of these requirements at the cloud infrastructure level.

The following diagram shows the Azure defense-in-depth model. For example, Microsoft provides basic cloud infrastructure DDOS, along with customer capabilities such as security appliances for customer-specific application DDOS needs.

This page outlines the foundational principles for securing your Services and applications, providing guidance and best practices on how to apply these principles; in other words, how customers should make smart use of Azure Government to meet the obligations and responsibilities that are required for a solution that handles ITAR information.

The overarching principles for securing customer data are:
* [Protecting data using encryption](azure-government-other-securingdata-protectingdatausingencryption.md).
* [Managing secrets](azure-government-other-securingdata-managingsecrets.md).
* [Isolation to restrict data access](azure-government-other-securingdata-isolation.md).
* [Detecting and responding to incidents](azure-government-other-securingdata-detectingandrespondingtoincidents.md).
