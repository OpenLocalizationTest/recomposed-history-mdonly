#  Detecting & Responding to Incidents

Microsoft Azure uses a shared responsibility model to define security and operational accountabilities. This means that a portion of security responsibility belongs to Microsoft, as the CSP, while some belongs to the customer. Microsoft Azure does not monitor for, or respond to, security events within the customer’s area of responsibility (such as a customer VM).

Although Microsoft makes every effort to ensure all Azure services are as secure as possible by default, this does not represent a security guarantee. Customers should test incident response plans to cover potential security event scenarios.
