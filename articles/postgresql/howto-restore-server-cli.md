# How to back up and restore a server in Azure Database for PostgreSQL by using the Azure CLI command-line tool

Use the Azure Database for PostgreSQL managed database service to restore a server database to an earlier date that spans from seven to 35 days.

## Prerequisites
To complete this how-to guide, you need:
- An [Azure Database for PostgreSQL server and database](quickstart-create-server-database-azure-cli.md)

[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you install and use the Azure CLI locally, this how-to guide requires that you use Azure CLI version 2.0 or later. To confirm the version, at the Azure CLI command prompt, enter `az --version`. To install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI 2.0]( /cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Back up happens automatically
When you use the Azure Database for PostgreSQL managed database service, the database service automatically makes a backup of the service every five minutes. 

For Basic Tier, the backup files are available for seven days. For Standard Tier, the backup files are available for 35 days. For more information, see [Azure Database for PostgreSQL pricing tiers](concepts-service-tiers.md).

With this automatic back up feature, you can restore the entire server configuration to an earlier date, or point-in-time.

## Restore a database to an earlier date by using the Azure CLI tool
Use Azure Database for PostgreSQL to restore the server to a previous point-in-time. The restored data is copied to a new server, and the existing server is left as is. For example, if a table is accidentally dropped at noon today, you can restore to the time just before noon. Then, you can retrieve the missing table and data from the restored copy of the server. 

To restore the server database, use the Azure CLI [az postgres server restore](/cli/azure/postgres/server#restore) command.

### Run the restore command

To restore the server database, at the Azure CLI command prompt, enter the following command:

```azurecli-interactive
az postgres server restore --resource-group myResourceGroup --name mypgserver-restored --restore-point-in-time 2017-04-13T13:59:00Z --source-server mypgserver-20170401
```

The `az postgres server restore` command requires the following parameters:
| Setting | Suggested value | Description  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| resource-group |  myResourceGroup |  The resource group where the source server exists.  |
| name | mypgserver-restored | The name of the new server that is created by the restore command. |
| restore-point-in-time | 2017-04-13T13:59:00Z | Select a point-in-time to restore to. This date and time must be within the source server's back up retention period. Use the ISO8601 date and time format. For example, you can use your own local time zone, such as `2017-04-13T05:59:00-08:00`. You can also use the UTC Zulu format, for example, `2017-04-13T13:59:00Z`. |
| source-server | mypgserver-20170401 | The name or ID of the source server to restore from. |

When you restore a server to an earlier point-in-time, a new server is set up with all the original databases from the source server. The data from the original database is copied to the restored databases on the new server. 

The location and pricing tier values for the restored server remain the same. 

The `az postgres server restore` command is synchronous. After the server is restored, you can use it again to repeat the process for a different point-in-time. 

After the restore process is complete, locate the new server and verify that the data is restored as expected.
