# Monitor and scale a single PostgreSQL server using Azure CLI
This sample CLI script scales a single Azure Database for PostgreSQL server to a different performance level after querying the metrics. 

[!INCLUDE [sample-cli-install](../../../includes/sample-cli-install.md)]

## Sample script
In this sample script, edit the highlighted lines to customize the admin username and password.
[!code-azurecli-interactive[main](../../../cli_scripts/postgresql/scale-postgresql-server/scale-postgresql-server.sh?highlight=15-16) "Create and scale Azure Database for PostgreSQL.")]

## Clean up deployment
After the script sample has been run, the following command can be used to remove the resource group and all resources associated with it.
```azurecli
az group delete --name myresourcegroup
```
## Script explanation
This script uses the following commands. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.

| **Command** | **Notes** |
|---|---|
| [az group create](/cli/azure/group#create) | Creates a resource group in which all resources are stored. |
| [az postgres server create](/cli/azure/postgres/server#create) | Creates a PostgreSQL server that hosts the databases. |
| [az monitor metrics list](/cli/azure/monitor/metrics#list) | List the metric value for the resources. |
| [az group delete](/cli/azure/group#delete) | Deletes a resource group including all nested resources. |
