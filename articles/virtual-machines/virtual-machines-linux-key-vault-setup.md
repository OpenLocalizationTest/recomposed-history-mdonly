# Setting up Key Vault for Virtual Machines in Azure Resource Manager

[AZURE.INCLUDE [learn-about-deployment-models](../../includes/learn-about-deployment-models-rm-include.md)] classic deployment model

In Azure Resource Manager stack, secrets/certificates are modeled as resources that are provided by the Key Vault Resource Provider. To learn more about Key Vaults see [What is Azure Key Vault?](../articles/key-vault-whatis.md)

## Setup
In order for a Key Vault to be used with Azure Resource Manager Virtual Machines, the *EnabledForDeployment* property on the Key Vault must be set to true. You can do this in the various clients as shown below.”

#### CLI
For creating the Key Vault using CLI see [Manage Key Vault using CLI](../articles/key-vault-manage-with-cli.md/#create-a-key-vault)

For CLI, you have to create the Key Vault first, then enable the deployment policy. You can do this using the following command

	azure keyvault set-policy ContosoKeyVault –enabled-for-deployment true

### Templates
While using templates, you need to set the `enabledForDeployment` property to `true` for the Key Vault resource.

	{
      "type": "Microsoft.KeyVault/vaults",
      "name": "ContosoKeyVault",
      "apiVersion": "2015-06-01",
      "location": "<location-of-key-vault>",
      "properties": {
        "enabledForDeployment": "true",
        ....
        ....
      }
    }

For other options you can configure while creating a Key Vault through templates see [here](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/templates/101-key-vault-create/)
