### Issue 2: You’re using a custom, gallery or marketplace image, and the audit log indicates an allocation failure
This error arises in situations when the new VM request is pinned to a cluster that either cannot support the VM size being requested, or does not have available free space to accommodate the request.

**Cause 1:** The cluster cannot support the requested VM size.

**Resolution 1:**

- Retry the request using a smaller VM size.
- If the size of the requested VM cannot be changed, stop all the VMs in the availability set. Create and start the new VM, and then restart each existing VM. Here’s how:

  - Click **Resource groups** > *your resource group* > **Resources** > *your availability set* > **Virtual Machines** > *your virtual machine* > **Stop**.
  - After all the VMs stop, create the new VM in the desired size. Then start the new VM first, and then select each of the stopped VMs and click **Start**.

**Cause 2:** The cluster does not have free resources.

**Resolution 2:**

- Retry the request at a later time.
- If the new VM can be part of a different availability set, create a new VM in a different availability set (in the same region). This new VM can then be added to the same virtual network.
