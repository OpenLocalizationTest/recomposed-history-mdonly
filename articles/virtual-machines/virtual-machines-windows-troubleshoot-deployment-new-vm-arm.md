## Issue: Custom/gallery/marketplace image; allocation failure
This error arises in situations when the new VM request is pinned to a cluster that either cannot support the VM size being requested, or does not have available free space to accommodate the request.

**Cause 1:** The cluster cannot support the requested VM size.

**Resolution 1:**

- Retry the request using a smaller VM size.
- If the size of the requested VM cannot be changed:
  - Stop all the VMs in the availability set.
  Click **Resource groups** > *your resource group* > **Resources** > *your availability set* > **Virtual Machines** > *your virtual machine* > **Stop**.
  - After all the VMs stop, create the new VM in the desired size.
  - Start the new VM first, and then select each of the stopped VMs and click **Start**.

**Cause 2:** The cluster does not have free resources.

**Resolution 2:**

- Retry the request at a later time.
- If the new VM can be part of a different availability set
  - Create a new VM in a different availability set (in the same region).
  - Add the new VM to the same virtual network.
