# Secure network traffic between virtual machine

This script creates two virtual machines and secures incoming traffic to both. One virtual machine is accessible on the internet and has an NSG configured to allow traffic on port 22 and port 80. The second virtual machine is not accessible on the internet, and has an NSG configured to only allow traffic from the first virtual machine. This sample works in Bash. For options on running Azure CLI scripts on Windows, see [Running the Azure CLI in Windows](../virtual-machines-windows-cli-options.md).

Before running this script, ensure that a connection with Azure has been created using the `az login` command. Also, an SSH public key with the name `id_rsa.pub` must be stored in the ~/.ssh directory.

## Create VM sample with NSG

[!code-azurecli[main](../../../cli_scripts/virtual-machine/create-vm-nsg/create-vm-nsg.sh "Create VM with NSG")]

## Clean up deployment 

After the script sample has been run, the follow command can be used to remove the Resource Group, VM, and all related resources.

```azurecli
az group delete --name myResourceGroup
```

## Script explanation

This script uses the following commands to create a resource group, virtual machine, and all related resources. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.

| Command | Notes |
|---|---|
| [az group create](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/group#create) | Creates a resource group in which all resources are stored. |
| [az network vnet create](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/network/vnet#create) | Creates an Azure virtual network and subnet. |
| [az network vnet subnet create](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/network/vnet/subnet#create) | Creates a subnet. |
| [az network public-ip create](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/network/public-ip#create) | Creates a public IP address with a static IP address and an associated DNS name. |
| [az network nsg create](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/network/nsg#create) | Creates a network security group, which is a security boundary between the internet and the virtual machine. |
| [az network nsg rule create](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/network/nsg/rule#create) | Creates an NSG rule to allow inbound traffic. |
| [az network vnet subnet update](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/network/vnet/subnet#update) | Updates an Azure subnet. In this sample, the Network Security Groups are associated with existing subnets. |
| [az network nic create](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/network/nic#create) | Creates a virtual network card and attaches it to the virtual network, subnet, and NSG. |
| [az vm create](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/vm#create) | Creates the virtual machine and connects it to the network card, virtual network, subnet, NSG. This command also specifies the virtual machine image to be used, and administrative credentials.  |
| [az group delete](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/vm/extension#set) | Deletes a resource group including all nested resources. |
