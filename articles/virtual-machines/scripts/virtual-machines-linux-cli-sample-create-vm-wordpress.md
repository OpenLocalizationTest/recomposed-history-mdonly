# Create a VM with WordPress

This script creates a virtual machine, and then uses the Azure Virtual Machine custom script extension to install WordPress. Once the script has been run, the WordPress configuration site can be accessed at `http://<public IP of VM>/wordpress`. 

Before running this script, ensure that a connection with Azure has been created using the `az login` command. Also, an SSH public key with the name `id_rsa.pub` must be stored in the ~/.ssh directory.

This sample works in a Bash shell. For options on running Azure CLI scripts on Windows client, see [Running the Azure CLI in Windows](../virtual-machines-windows-cli-options.md).

## Sample script

[!code-azurecli[main](../../../cli_scripts/virtual-machine/create-wordpress-mysql/create-wordpress-mysql.sh "Quick Create VM")]

## Clean up deployment 

After the script sample has been run, the following command can be used to remove the Resource Group, VM, and all related resources.

```azurecli
az group delete --name myResourceGroup
```

## Script explanation

This script uses the following commands to create a resource group, virtual machine, and all related resources. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.

| Command | Notes |
|---|---|
| [az group create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/group#create) | Creates a resource group in which all resources are stored. |
| [az network vnet create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/network/vnet#create) | Creates an Azure virtual network and subnet. |
| [az network public-ip create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/network/public-ip#create) | Creates a public IP address with a static IP address and an associated DNS name. |
| [az network nsg create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/network/nsg#create) | Creates a network security group (NSG), which is a security boundary between the internet and the virtual machine. |
| [az network nsg rule create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/network/nsg/rule#create) | Creates an NSG rule to allow inbound traffic. In this sample, port 22 is opened for SSH and port 80 for HTTP traffic. |
| [az network nic create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/network/nic#create) | Creates a virtual network card and attaches it to the virtual network, subnet, and NSG. |
| [az vm create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/vm#create) | Creates the virtual machine and connects it to the network card, virtual network, subnet, and NSG. This command also specifies the virtual machine image to be used, and administrative credentials.  |
| [az vm extension set](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/vm#create) | Add the Custom Script Extension to the virtual machine, which invokes a script to install WordPress. |
| [az group delete](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/vm/extension#set) | Deletes a resource group including all nested resources. |
