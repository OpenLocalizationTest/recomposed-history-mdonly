# Create a VM with NGINX

This script creates an Azure Virtual Machine and then uses the Azure Virtual Machine Custom Script Extension to install NGINX. Once the script has been run, the NGINX default site can be reached on the public IP address of the virtual machine.

Before running this script, ensure that a connection with Azure has been created using the `az login` command. Also, an SSH public key with the name `id_rsa.pub` must be stored in the ~/.ssh directory.

This sample works in a Bash shell. For options on running Azure CLI scripts on Windows client, see [Running the Azure CLI in Windows](../virtual-machines-windows-cli-options.md).

## Create VM sample

The following script creates the virtual machine and invokes the custom script extension.

[!code-azurecli[main](../../../cli_scripts/virtual-machine/create-vm-nginx/create-vm-nginx.sh "Quick Create VM")]

## Custom Scrpt Extension

The custom script extension copies this script onto the virtual machine and runs it to install NGINX.

[!code-azurecli[main](../../../cli_scripts/virtual-machine/create-vm-nginx/install_nginx.sh "NGINX")]

## Clean up deployment 

After the script sample has been run, the following command can be used to remove the Resource Group, VM, and all related resources.

```azurecli
az group delete --name myResourceGroup
```

## Script explanation

This script uses the following commands to create a resource group, virtual machine, and all related resources. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.

| Command | Notes |
|---|---|
| [az group create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/group#create) | Creates a resource group in which all resources are stored. |
| [az vm create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/vm#create) | Creates the virtual machine. This command also specifies the virtual machine image to be used, and administrative credentials.  |
| [az network nsg list](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/network/nsg#create) | Lists network security groups. In this case, the name of the network security group is stored in a variable for later use in the script. |
| [az network nsg rule create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/network/nsg/rule#create) | Creates an NSG rule to allow inbound traffic. In this sample, port 80 is opened for HTTP traffic. |
| [azure vm extension set](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/vm/extension#set) | Adds and runs a virtual machine extension to a VM. In this sample, the custom script extension is used to install NGINX.|
| [az group delete](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/vm/extension#set) | Deletes a resource group including all nested resources. |

## Next steps

For more information on the Azure CLI see [Azure CLI documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/overview).
