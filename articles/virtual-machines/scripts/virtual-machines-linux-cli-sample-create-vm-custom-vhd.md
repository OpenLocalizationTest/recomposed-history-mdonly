# Create a VM with a custom VHD

This example creates a virtual machine using a custom VHD.
It creates a storage account and container,
uploads the VHD to the container,
and then repalces the VM user's (deploy user) ssh public key with your public key.

Before you run the sample, 
download the custom VHD from https://azclisamples.blob.core.windows.net/vhds/sample.vhd.

```bash
curl https://azclisamples.blob.core.windows.net/vhds/sample.vhd > sample.vhd
```

This sample works in a Bash shell. For options on running Azure CLI scripts on Windows client, see [Running the Azure CLI in Windows](../virtual-machines-windows-cli-options.md).

## Sample script

[!code-azurecli[main](../../../cli_scripts/virtual-machine/create-vm-custom-vhd/create-vm-custom-vhd.sh "Create VM with custom VHD")]

## Clean up deployment 

After the script sample has been run, the following command can be used to remove the resource groups, VMs, and all related resources.

```azurecli
az group delete -n az-cli-custom-vhd
```

## Script explanation

This script uses the following commands to create a resource group, virtual machine, availability set, load balancer, and all related resources. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.

| [az storage account check-name](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/storage/account#check-name) | Checks that a storage account name is valid and that it doesn't already exist |

| [az storage container create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/storage/container#create) | Creates a container in a storage account. |
| [az storage blob upload](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/storage/blob#upload) | Creates a blob in the container by uploading the VHD. |
| [az vm list](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/vm#list) | Used with `--query` check whether the VM name is in use. | 
| [az vm create](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/vm/availability-set#create) | Creates the virtual machines. |
| [az vm access set-linux-user](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/vm/access#set-linux-user) | Resets the SSH key to give the current user access to the VM. |
| [az vm list-ip-addresses](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/vm#list-ip-addresses) | Gets the IP address of the VM that was created. |
