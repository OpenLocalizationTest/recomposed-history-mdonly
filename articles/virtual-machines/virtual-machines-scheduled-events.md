# Azure Metadata Service - Scheduled Events

Azure Metadata service enables you to discover information about your Virtual Machine hosted in Azure. The Azure Metadata Service can notify your Virtual Machine about upcoming events (for example, reboot) 
so your service can prepare for them and limit disruption. It's available for all Azure Virtual Machine types including PaaS as well as IaaS. The service gives your Virtual Machine time to perform 
preventive tasks and minimize the effect of an event. For example, your service might drain sessions, elect a new leader, or copy data after observing that an instance is scheduled for reboot to avoid 
disruption. The Service enables your Virtual Machine to notify Azure that it can continue with the event (ahead of time). This is useful for expediting the impact when your service has successfully complete the graceful shutdown sequence. 



## Introduction - Why Scheduled Events?

With Scheduled Events, you can learn of (discover) upcoming events which impact the availability of your VMs and take proactive operations to limit the impact on your service.
Multi-instance workloads, which use replication techniques to maintain state, may be vulnerable to frequent outages happening across multiple instances. Such outages may result in expensive tasks 
(for example, rebuilding indexes) or even a replica loss.
In many other cases, using graceful shutdown sequence improves the overall service availability. For example, completing (or canceling) in-flight transactions, reassigning other tasks to other VMs 
in the cluster (manual failover), remove the Virtual Machine from a load balancer pool.
There are cases where notifying an administrator about upcoming event or even just logging such an event help improving the serviceability of applications hosted in the cloud.

Azure Metadata Service surfaces scheduled events in the following use cases:     
-   Platform initiated ‘impactful’ maintenance (for example, Host OS rollout)
-   Platform initiated ‘impact-less’ maintenance (for example, In-place VM Migration)
-   Interactive calls (for example, user restarts or redeploy a VM)



## Scheduled Events – The Basics  

Azure Metadata service expose information about running Virtual Machines using a REST Endpoint from within the VM. The information is available via a Non-routable IP so that it is not exposed 
outside the VM.

### Scope 
Scheduled events are surfaced to all VMs in a cloud service or to all VMs in an Availability Set. As a result,  you should check the **Resources* field in the event to identify which VMs are
going to be impacted.

### Discover the Endpoint
In the case where a Virtual Machine is created within a Virtual Network (VNet), the metadata service is available from the non-routable IP of:
169.254.169.254

In the case where a Virtual Machine is used for cloud services (PaaS), metadata service endpoint could be discovered using the registry.

    {HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows Azure\DeploymentManagement}

### Versioning 
The Metadata Service uses a versioned API in the following format: http://{ip}/metadata/{version}/scheduledevents
It is recommended that your service consumes the latest version available at: http://{ip}/metadata/latest/scheduledevents

### Using Headers
When you query the Metadata Service, you must provide the following header **Metadata:true **. 

### Enable Scheduled Events
The first time you make the call to the scheduled events endpoint, Azure will implicitly enable the feature on your Virtual Machine. 
As a result, you should expect a delayed response in your first call of up to a minute. 


## Using the API

### Query for events
You can query for Scheduled Events simply by making the following call

	curl -H Metadata:true http://169.254.169.254/metadata/latest/scheduledevents

A response contains an array of scheduled events. An empty array means that there are currently no events scheduled.
In the case where there are scheduled events, the response will look like this: 

	{
     "Events":[
          {
                "EventId":{eventID},
                "EventType":"Reboot" | "Redeploy" | "Pause",
                "ResourceType":"VirtualMachine",
                "Resources":[{resourceName}],
                "EventStatus":"Scheduled" | "Started",
                "NotBefore":{timeInUTC},              
         }
     ]
	}

EventType Captures the expected impact on the Virtual Machine where:
- Pause: The Virtual Machine will be paused for few seconds. There is no impact on memory, open files or network connections
- Reboot: The Virtual Machine is scheduled for reboot (memory will be wiped).
- Redeploy: The Virtual Machine is scheduled to move to another node (ephemeral disk will be lost). 

Note that when an event is scheduled (Status = Scheduled) Azure shares the time after which the event can start (specified in the NotBefore field).

### Starting an event (expedite)

Once you have learned of an upcoming event, and completed your logic for graceful shutdown, you can start the event indicating Azure to move faster (when possible) by making a **POST** call 
 

## Samples 


### PowerShell Sample 

The following sample reads the metadata server for scheduled events and
record them in the Application event log before acknowledging.

```PowerShell
$localHostIP = "169.254.169.254"
$ScheduledEventURI = "http://"+$localHostIP+"/metadata/latest/scheduledevents"

# Call Azure Metadata Service - Scheduled Events 
$scheduledEventsResponse =  Invoke-RestMethod -Headers @{"Metadata"="true"} -URI $ScheduledEventURI -Method get 

if ($json.Events.Count -eq 0 )
{
    Write-Output "++No scheduled events were found"
}

for ($eventIdx=0; $eventIdx -lt $scheduledEventsResponse.Events.Length ; $eventIdx++)
{
    if ($scheduledEventsResponse.Events[$eventIdx].Resources[0].ToLower().substring(1) -eq $env:COMPUTERNAME.ToLower())
    {    
        # YOUR LOGIC HERE 
         pause "This Virtual Machine is scheduled for to "+ $scheduledEventsResponse.Events[$eventIdx].EventType

        # Acknoledge the event to expedite
        $jsonResp = "{""StartRequests"" : [{ ""EventId"": """+$scheduledEventsResponse.events[$eventIdx].EventId +"""}]}"
        $respbody = convertto-JSon $jsonResp
       
        Invoke-RestMethod -Uri $ScheduledEventURI  -Headers @{"Metadata"="true"} -Method POST -Body $jsonResp 
    }
}


``` 


### C\# Sample 

```csharp
static async Task RunAsync()
{
    try
    {
        using (var client = new HttpClient())
        {
            client.BaseAddress = new Uri("http://169.254.169.254/");
            client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Accept.Clear();
            client.DefaultRequestHeaders.Accept.Add(new\
            MediaTypeWithQualityHeaderValue("application/json"));
            HttpResponseMessage response = await client.GetAsync(\
            "metadata/latest/scheduledevents");

            if (response.IsSuccessStatusCode)
            {
                JSonHelper helper = new JSonHelper();
                CloudControlMessage msg =
                helper.ConvertJSonToObject&lt;CloudControlMessage&gt;\
                (response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync().Result);
                await AnalyzeCloudControlEvents(msg);
            }

            else
            {
                Debug.WriteLine("REST Call returned failed {0}",
                response.IsSuccessStatusCode);
            }
        }
    }

    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        Debug.WriteLine("Exception caught {0}", ex);
    }
}
```
