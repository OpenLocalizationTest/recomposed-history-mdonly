# Troubleshoot Remote Desktop connections to an Azure virtual machine running Windows

The Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) connection to your Windows-based Azure virtual machine can fail for various reasons. The issue can be with the Remote Desktop service on the VM, the network connection, or the Remote Desktop client on your host computer. This article will help you discover and correct the reasons for the failure.  

[AZURE.INCLUDE [learn-about-deployment-models](../../includes/learn-about-deployment-models-both-include.md)]

This article applies to Azure virtual machines that are running Windows. For Azure virtual machines that are running Linux, see [Troubleshoot Secure Shell connections to a Linux-based Azure virtual machine](virtual-machines-linux-troubleshoot-ssh-connection.md).

If you need more help at any point in this article, you can contact the Azure experts on [the MSDN Azure and Stack Overflow forums](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/forums/). Alternatively, you can file an Azure support incident. Go to the [Azure support site](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/options/) and select **Get Support**.

## Fix common Remote Desktop errors

This section lists quick fixes for common Remote Desktop connection issues.

### Troubleshoot virtual machines created by using the classic deployment model

These steps can help resolve most Remote Desktop connection failures in Azure virtual machines that were created by using the classic deployment model. After each step, try reconnecting to the VM.

- Reset the Remote Desktop service from the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) to fix startup issues with the RDP server. Select **Browse** > **Virtual machines (classic)** > *your Windows virtual machine* > **Reset Remote...**.

- Restart the virtual machine to address other startup issues. Select **Browse** > **Virtual machines (classic)** > *your Windows virtual machine* > **Restart**.

- Redeploy the virtual machine to a new Azure node. See [Redeploy Virtual Machine to new Azure node](virtual-machines-windows-redeploy-to-new-node.md).

	Note that after this operation finishes, ephemeral disk data will be lost and dynamic IP addresses that are associated with the virtual machine will be updated.

- Review your VMâ€™s console log or screenshot to correct boot problems.
	Select **Browse** > **Virtual machines (classic**) > *your Windows virtual machine* > **Settings** > **Boot diagnostics**.

- Check the VM's Resource Health for any platform issues. Select **Browse** > **Virtual machines (classic)** > *your Windows virtual machine* > **Settings** > **Check Health**.

### Troubleshoot virtual machines created by using the Resource Manager deployment model

These steps can help resolve most Remote Desktop connection failures in Azure virtual machines that were created by using the Resource Manager deployment model. After each step, try reconnecting to the VM.

- Reset remote access by using PowerShell.
	- If you haven't already, [install PowerShell and connect to your Azure subscription](../powershell-install-configure.md) by using the Azure Active Directory method. Note that you don't need to switch to Resource Manager mode in PowerShell versions 1.0.x.

	- Reset your RDP connection by using either of the following PowerShell commands. Replace the `myRG`, `myVM`, `myVMAccessExtension`, and location with values that are relevant to your setup.

	```
Set-AzureRmVMExtension -ResourceGroupName "myRG" -VMName "myVM" -Name "myVMAccessExtension" -ExtensionType "VMAccessAgent" -Publisher "Microsoft.Compute" -typeHandlerVersion "2.0" -Location Westus
	```
	OR

  ```
Set-AzureRmVMAccessExtension -ResourceGroupName "myRG" -VMName "myVM" -Name "myVMAccess" -Location Westus
  ```

- Restart the virtual machine to address other startup issues. Select **Browse** > **Virtual machines** > *your Windows virtual machine* > **Restart**.

- Resize the VM to fix any host issues. Select **Browse** > **Virtual machines** > *your Windows virtual machine* > **Settings** > **Size**.

- Review the VM's console log or screenshot to correct boot problems. Select **Browse** > **Virtual machines** > *your Windows virtual machine* > **Settings** > **Boot diagnostics**.


Proceed to the next section if the previous steps didn't resolve your Remote Desktop connection failures.

## Troubleshoot specific Remote Desktop connection errors

The following are the most common errors you'll see when trying to use Remote Desktop to connect to your Azure virtual machine:

- [Remote Desktop connection error: The remote session was disconnected because there are no Remote Desktop License Servers available to provide a license](#rdplicense).

- [Remote Desktop connection error: Remote Desktop can't find the computer "name"](#rdpname).

- [Remote Desktop connection error: An authentication error has occurred. The Local Security Authority cannot be contacted](#rdpauth).

- [Windows Security error: Your credentials did not work](#wincred).

- [Remote Desktop connection error: This computer can't connect to the remote computer](#rdpconnect).

<a id="rdplicense"></a>
### Remote Desktop connection error: The remote session was disconnected because there are no Remote Desktop License Servers available to provide a license.

Cause: The 120-day licensing grace period for the Remote Desktop Server role has expired and you need to install licenses.

As a workaround, save a local copy of the RDP file from the portal and run this command at a PowerShell command prompt to connect. This will disable licensing for just that connection:

		mstsc <File name>.RDP /admin

If you don't actually need more than two simultaneous Remote Desktop connections to the VM, you can use Server Manager to remove the Remote Desktop Server role.

For more information, see the the blog post [Azure VM fails with "No Remote Desktop License Servers available"](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/wats/archive/2014/01/21/rdp-to-azure-vm-fails-with-quot-no-remote-desktop-license-servers-available-quot.aspx).

<a id="rdpname"></a>
### Remote Desktop connection error: Remote Desktop can't find the computer "name".

Cause: The Remote Desktop client on your computer can't resolve the name of the computer in the settings of the RDP file.

Possible solutions:

- If you're on an organization's intranet, make sure that your computer has access to the proxy server and can send HTTPS traffic to it.

- If you're using a locally stored RDP file, try using the one that's generated by the portal. This will ensure that you have the correct DNS name for the virtual machine, or the cloud service and the endpoint port of the virtual machine. Here is a sample RDP file generated by the portal:

		full address:s:tailspin-azdatatier.cloudapp.net:55919
		prompt for credentials:i:1

The address portion of this RDP file has:
- The fully qualified domain name of the cloud service that contains the VM ("tailspin-azdatatier.cloudapp.net" in this example).

- The external TCP port of the endpoint for Remote Desktop traffic (55919).

<a id="rdpauth"></a>
### Remote Desktop connection error: An authentication error has occurred. The Local Security Authority cannot be contacted.

Cause: The target VM can't locate the security authority in the user name portion of your credentials.

When your user name is in the form *SecurityAuthority*\\*UserName* (example: CORP\User1), the *SecurityAuthority* portion is either the virtual machine's computer name (for the local security authority) or an Active Directory domain name.

Possible solutions:

- If the account is local to the VM, make sure that the VM name is spelled correctly.

- If the account is on an Active Directory domain, check the spelling of the domain name.

- If it is an Active Directory domain account and the domain name is spelled correctly, verify that a domain controller is available in that domain. This can be a common issue in an Azure virtual network that contains domain controllers, in which a domain controller computer is not started. As a workaround, you can use a local administrator account instead of a domain account.

<a id="wincred"></a>
### Windows Security error: Your credentials did not work.

Cause: The target VM can't validate your account name and password.

A Windows-based computer can validate the credentials of either a local account or a domain account.

- For local accounts, use the *ComputerName*\\*UserName* syntax (example: SQL1\Admin4798).
- For domain accounts, use the *DomainName*\\*UserName* syntax (example: CONTOSO\johndoe).

If you have promoted your VM to a domain controller in a new Active Directory forest, the local administrator account that you signed in with is converted to an equivalent account with the same password in the new forest and domain. The local account is then deleted.

For example, if you signed in with the local account DC1\DCAdmin, and then promoted the virtual machine as a domain controller in a new forest for the corp.contoso.com domain, the DC1\DCAdmin local account gets deleted and a new domain account (CORP\DCAdmin) is created with the same password.

Make sure that the account name is a name that the virtual machine can verify as a valid account, and that the password is correct.

If you need to change the password of the local administrator account, see [How to reset a password or the Remote Desktop service for Windows virtual machines](virtual-machines-windows-reset-rdp.md).

### Remote Desktop connection error: This computer can't connect to the remote computer.

Cause: The account that's used to connect does not have Remote Desktop sign-in rights.

Every Windows computer has a Remote Desktop users local group, which contains the accounts and groups that can sign into it remotely. Members of the local administrators group also have access, even though those accounts are not listed in the Remote Desktop users local group. For domain-joined machines, the local administrators group also contains the domain administrators for the domain.

Make sure that the account you're using to connect with has Remote Desktop sign-in rights. As a workaround, use a domain or local administrator account to connect over Remote Desktop. Then use the Microsoft Management Console snap-in (**System Tools > Local Users and Groups > Groups > Remote Desktop Users**) to add the desired account to the Remote Desktop users local group.

## Troubleshoot generic Remote Desktop errors

If none of these errors occurred and you still can't connect to the VM via Remote Desktop, read the detailed [troubleshooting guide for Remote Desktop](virtual-machines-windows-detailed-troubleshoot-rdp.md).
