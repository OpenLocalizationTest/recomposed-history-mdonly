# Create data disks as managed disks

Create a data disk as a managed disk. The data disk can be created from an existing data disk VHD in an Azure storage account or as a new empty data disk using [New-AzureRmDisk](xxx.md) and [New-AzureRmDiskConfig](xxx.md) cmdlets.

## Create a managed data disk from a VHD in an Azure storage account

In the example we create a data disk from a VHD as managed disk and assign it to the parameter **$dataDisk1** to use later. 

The managed disk will be created in the **West-US** location, in a resource group named **myResourceGroup**. The disk will be named **myDataDisk** and it will be created from a VHD file named **datadisk.vhd** we previously uploaded to a storage account named **mystorageaccount**. The managed disk will be created in premium locally-redundant storage (LRS). StandardLRS and PremiumLRS are the only **-AccountType** options available for managed disks. 

1.  Set some parameters

    ```powershell
    $resourceGroupName = "myResourceGroup"
    $location = "westus"
    $dataDiskName = "myDataDisk"
    $dataVhdUri = "https://mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/vhds/datadisk.vhd"

2. Create the data disk. 
    ```powershell
    $dataDisk1 = New-AzureRmDisk -DiskName $dataDiskName -Disk (New-AzureRmDiskConfig -AccountType PremiumLRS -Location $location -CreationDataCreateOption Import -SourceUri $dataVhdUri) -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName
	```
	
	

### Create an empty data disk as a managed

In the example we create an empty data disk as managed disk and assign it to the parameter **$dataDisk2** to use later. An empty data disk will need to be initialized loggin g in to the VM and using diskmgmt.msc or [remotely using WinRM and a script](virtual-machines-windows-ps-manage.md#add-a-data-disk-to-a-virtual-machine), once it is attached to a running VM.

The empty data disk will be created in the **West-US** location, in a resource group named **myResourceGroup**. The disk will be named **myEmptyDataDisk**. The empty disk will be created in premium locally-redundant storage (LRS). StandardLRS and PremiumLRS are the only **-AccountType** options available for managed disks.

The disk size in this example is 128GB, but you should choosed a size that meets the needs of any applications running on your VM.

1.  Set some parameters

    ```powershell
    $resourceGroupName = "myResourceGroup"
    $location = "westus"
    $dataDiskName = "myEmptyDataDisk"
    ```

2. Create the data disk.
    ```powershell
    $dataDisk2 = New-AzureRmDisk -DiskName $dataDiskName -Disk (New-AzureRmDiskConfig -AccountType PremiumLRS -Location $location -CreationDataCreateOption Empty -DiskSizeGB 128) -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName
	```

- [Create a specialized VM](virtual-machines-windows-create-vm-specialized.md)
- [Create a generalized VM](virtual-machines-windows-create-vm-generalized.md)
- If you already have a VM, you can [attach a data disk](virtual-machines-windows-attach-disk-portal.md).
