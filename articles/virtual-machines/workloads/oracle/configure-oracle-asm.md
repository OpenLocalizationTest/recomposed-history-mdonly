# Set up Oracle ASM on an Azure Linux virtual machine  

Azure virtual machines provide a fully configurable and flexible computing environment. This tutorial covers basic Azure virtual machine deployment combined with the installation and configuration of Oracle Automated Storage Management (ASM).  You learn how to:

> [!div class="checklist"]
> * Create and connect to a VM
> * Select and use VM images
> * View and use specific VM sizes
> * Resize a VM
> * View and understand VM state


[!INCLUDE [cloud-shell-try-it.md](../../../../includes/cloud-shell-try-it.md)]

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, this tutorial requires that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.0.4 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI 2.0]( /cli/azure/install-azure-cli). 

## Prepare the environment

### Create a resource group

To create a resource group, use the [az group create](/cli/azure/group#create) command. An Azure resource group is a logical container in which Azure resources are deployed and managed. In this example, a resource group named *myResourceGroup* in the *eastus* region.

```azurecli-interactive
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location eastus
```

### Create a VM

To create a virtual machine based on the Oracle Database image and configure it to use Oracle ASM, use the [az vm create](/cli/azure/vm#create) command. 

The following example creates a VM named myVM that is a Standard_DS2_v2 size with four attached data disks of 50 GB each. It also creates SSH keys, if they do not already exist in a default key location. To use a specific set of keys, use the `--ssh-key-value` option.  

   ```azurecli-interactive
   az vm create --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --name myVM \
    --image Oracle:Oracle-Database-Ee:12.1.0.2:latest \
    --size Standard_DS2_v2 \
    --generate-ssh-keys \
    --data-disk-sizes-gb 50 50 50 50
   ```

After you create the VM, Azure CLI displays information similar to the following example. Note the value for `publicIpAddress`. You will use this address to access the VM.

   ```azurecli
   {
     "fqdns": "",
     "id": "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/myVM",
     "location": "eastus",
     "macAddress": "00-0D-3A-36-2F-56",
     "powerState": "VM running",
     "privateIpAddress": "10.0.0.4",
     "publicIpAddress": "13.64.104.241",
     "resourceGroup": "myResourceGroup"
   }
   ```

### Connect to the VM

To create an SSH session with the VM and configure additional settings, use the following command. Replace the IP address with the `publicIpAddress` value for your VM.

```bash 
ssh <publicIpAddress>
```

## Install Oracle ASM

To install Oracle ASM, complete the following steps. 

For more information about installing Oracle ASM, see [Oracle ASMLib Downloads for Oracle Linux 6](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/server-storage/linux/asmlib/ol6-1709075.html).  

1. You need to login as root in order to continue with ASM installation.:

   ```bash
   sudo su -
   ```
   
2. Run these additional commands to install Oracle ASM components:

   ```bash
    yum list | grep oracleasm &&\
    yum -y install kmod-oracleasm.x86_64 &&\
    yum -y install oracleasm-support.x86_64 &&\
    wget http://download.oracle.com/otn_software/asmlib/oracleasmlib-2.0.12-1.el6.x86_64.rpm &&\
    yum -y install oracleasmlib-2.0.12-1.el6.x86_64.rpm &&\
    rm -f oracleasmlib-2.0.12-1.el6.x86_64.rpm
   ```

3. Verify that Oracle ASM is installed:

   ```bash
   rpm -qa |grep oracleasm
   ```

    The output of this command should list the following components:

    ```bash
   oracleasm-support-2.1.10-4.el6.x86_64
   kmod-oracleasm-2.0.8-15.el6_9.x86_64
   oracleasmlib-2.0.12-1.el6.x86_64
    ```

4. ASM requires specific users and roles in order to function correctly. The following commands will create the pre-requisite user accounts and groups: 

   ```bash
    groupadd -g 54345 asmadmin &&\
    groupadd -g 54346 asmdba &&\
    groupadd -g 54347 asmoper &&\
    useradd -u 3000 -g oinstall -G dba,asmadmin,asmdba,asmoper grid &&\
    usermod -g oinstall -G dba,asmdba,asmadmin oracle
   ```

5. Verify users and groups were create correctly:

   ```bash
   id grid
   ```

    The output of this command should list the following users and groups:

    ```bash
    uid=3000(grid) gid=54321(oinstall) groups=54321(oinstall),54322(dba),54345(asmadmin),54346(asmdba),54347(asmoper)
    ```
 
6. Create a folder for user *grid* and change the owner:

   ```bash
   mkdir /u01/app/grid &&\
   chown grid:oinstall /u01/app/grid
   ```

## Set up Oracle ASM

For this tutorial, the default user is *grid* and the default group is *asmadmin*. Ensure that the *oracle* user is part of the asmadmin group. To set up your Oracle ASM installation, complete the following steps:

1. Seting up the Oracle ASM library driver involves defining the default user (grid) and default group (asmadmin) as well as configuring the drive to start on boot (choose y) and to scan for disks on boot (choose y). You will need to answer the prompts from the following command:

   ```bash
   /usr/sbin/oracleasm configure -i
   ```

The output of this command should look similar to the following, stopping with prompts to be answered.

    ```bash
   Configuring the Oracle ASM library driver.

   This will configure the on-boot properties of the Oracle ASM library
   driver. The following questions will determine whether the driver is
   loaded on boot and what permissions it will have. The current values
   will be shown in brackets ('[]'). Hitting <ENTER> without typing an
   answer will keep that current value. Ctrl-C will abort.

   Default user to own the driver interface []: grid
   Default group to own the driver interface []: asmadmin
   Start Oracle ASM library driver on boot (y/n) [n]: y
   Scan for Oracle ASM disks on boot (y/n) [y]: y
   Writing Oracle ASM library driver configuration: done
   ```

2. View the disk configuration:
   ```bash
   cat /proc/partitions
   ```

The output of this command should look simiar to the following listing of available disks

    ```bash
   8       16   14680064 sdb
   8       17   14678976 sdb1
   8        0   52428800 sda
   8        1     512000 sda1
   8        2   51915776 sda2
   8       48   52428800 sdd
   8       64   52428800 sde
   8       80   52428800 sdf
   8       32   52428800 sdc
  11        0       1152 sr0
    ```

3. Format disk */dev/sdc* by running the following command and answering the prompts with *n* for new partition, *p* for primary partition, *1* to select the first partition, press `enter` for the default first cylinder, press `enter` for the default last cylinder and finally press *w* to write the changes to the partition table.  

   ```bash
   fdisk /dev/sdc
    ```
   
Using the answers provided above, the output for the fdisk command should look like the following:

    ```bash
   Device contains not a valid DOS partition table, or Sun, SGI or OSF disklabel
   Building a new DOS disklabel with disk identifier 0xf865c6ca.
   Changes will remain in memory only, until you decide to write them.
   After that, of course, the previous content won't be recoverable.

   Warning: invalid flag 0x0000 of partition table 4 will be corrected by w(rite)

   The device presents a logical sector size that is smaller than
   the physical sector size. Aligning to a physical sector (or optimal
   I/O) size boundary is recommended, or performance may be impacted.

   WARNING: DOS-compatible mode is deprecated. It's strongly recommended to
           switch off the mode (command 'c') and change display units to
           sectors (command 'u').

   Command (m for help): n
   Command action
     e   extended
     p   primary partition (1-4)

   Calling ioctl() to re-read partition table.
   Syncing disks.
   ```

4. Repeat the preceding fdisk command for `/dev/sdd`, `/dev/sde`, and `/dev/sdf`.

5. Check the disk configuration:

   ```bash
   cat /proc/partitions
    ```

The output of the command should look like the following;

    ```bash
   major minor  #blocks  name

     8       16   14680064 sdb
     8       17   14678976 sdb1
     8       32   52428800 sdc
     8       33   52428096 sdc1
     8       48   52428800 sdd
     8       49   52428096 sdd1
     8       64   52428800 sde
     8       65   52428096 sde1
     8       80   52428800 sdf
     8       81   52428096 sdf1
     8        0   52428800 sda
     8        1     512000 sda1
     8        2   51915776 sda2
     11        0    1048575 sr0
   ```

6. Check the Oracle ASM service status and start the Oracle ASM service:

   ```bash
   service oracleasm status &&\
   service oracleasm start
    ```

The output of the command should look like the following:
   
    ```bash
   Checking if ASM is loaded: no
   Checking if /dev/oracleasm is mounted: no
   Initializing the Oracle ASMLib driver:                     [  OK  ]
   Scanning the system for Oracle ASMLib disks:               [  OK  ]
   ```

7. Create Oracle ASM disks:

   ```bash
    service oracleasm createdisk ASMSP /dev/sdc1 &&\
    service oracleasm createdisk DATA /dev/sdd1 &&\
    service oracleasm createdisk DATA1 /dev/sde1 &&\
    service oracleasm createdisk FRA /dev/sdf1
   ```    

The output of the command should look like the following:

    ```bash
   Marking disk "ASMSP" as an ASM disk:                       [  OK  ]
   Marking disk "DATA" as an ASM disk:                        [  OK  ]
   Marking disk "DATA1" as an ASM disk:                       [  OK  ]
   Marking disk "FRA" as an ASM disk:                         [  OK  ]
    ```

8. List Oracle ASM disks:

   ```bash
   service oracleasm listdisks
   ```   

The output of the command should list off the following Oracle ASM disks:

   ```bash
    ASMSP
    DATA
    DATA1
    FRA
   ```

9. Change the passwords for the root, oracle, and grid users. You will need to **make note of these new passwords** as you will be using them later during the installation.

    ```bash
    passwd oracle &&\
    passwd grid &&\
    passwd root
    ```

10. Change the folder permission:

    ```bash
    chmod -R 775 /opt &&\
    chown grid:oinstall /opt &&\
    chown oracle:oinstall /dev/sdc1 &&\
    chown oracle:oinstall /dev/sdd1 &&\
    chown oracle:oinstall /dev/sde1 &&\
    chown oracle:oinstall /dev/sdf1 &&\
    chmod 600 /dev/sdc1 &&\
    chmod 600 /dev/sdd1 &&\
    chmod 600 /dev/sde1 &&\
    chmod 600 /dev/sdf1
        ```

## Download and prepare Oracle Grid Infrastructure

To download and prepare the Oracle Grid Infrastructure software, complete the following steps:

1. Download Oracle Grid Infrastructure from the [Oracle ASM download page](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/enterprise-edition/downloads/database12c-linux-download-2240591.html). 

   Under the download titled **Oracle Database 12c Release 1 Grid Infrastructure (12.1.0.2.0) for Linux x86-64**, download the two .zip files.

2. After you download the .zip files to your client computer, you can use Secure Copy Protocol (SCP) to copy the files to your VM:

   ```bash
   scp *.zip <publicIpAddress>:<folder>
   ```

3. Move the .zip files to the /opt folder. Then, change the owner of the files:

   ```bash
   # mv <folder>/*.zip /opt
   # cd /opt
   # chown grid:oinstall linuxamd64_12102_grid_1of2.zip
   # chown grid:oinstall linuxamd64_12102_grid_2of2.zip
   ```

4. Unzip the files. (Install the Linux unzip tool if it's not already installed.)
   
   ```bash
   # yum install unzip
   # unzip linuxamd64_12102_grid_1of2.zip
   # unzip linuxamd64_12102_grid_2of2.zip
   ```

5. Change permission:
   
   ```bash
   # chown -R grid:oinstall /opt/grid
   ```

6. Turn off the firewall:
   
   ```bash
   # service iptables status
   # service iptables stop
   ```

7. Check available swap space. You need at least 6.8 GB of swap space to install Grid. Linux Azure VMs don't have swap enabled and configured by default.

We highly recommend that you use waagent to configure swap space so that it's always created on the ephemeral disk (temporary disk). For more information, see [How to add a swap file in Linux Azure virtual machines](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/4010058/how-to-add-a-swap-file-in-linux-azure-virtual-machines).

## Prepare the client and VM to run x11 (for Windows clients only)
This is an optional step. You can skip this step if you are using a Linux client or already have x11 set up.

1. [Download PuTTY](http://www.putty.org/) and [download Xming](https://xming.en.softonic.com/) to your Windows computer.

2. After you install PuTTY, in the PuTTY folder (for example, C:\Program Files\PuTTY), run puttygen.exe (PuTTY Key Generator).

3. In PuTTY Key Generator:
   
   1. Generate a key by selecting the **Generate** button.
   2. Copy the contents of the key (Ctrl+C).
   3. Select the **Save private key** button.
   4. Ignore the warning that appears, and then select **OK**.

   ![Screenshot of PuTTY Key Generator](./media/oracle-asm/puttykeygen.png)

4. In your VM, run these commands:

   ```bash
   # sudo su - grid
   $ mkdir .ssh (if not already created)
   $ cd .ssh
   ```

5. Create a file named authorized_keys. Paste the contents of the key in this file, and then save the file.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The key must contain the string `ssh-rsa`. Also, the contents of the key must be a single line of text.
   >  

6. Start PuTTY. In the **Category** pane, go to **Connection** > **SSH** > **Auth**. In the **Private key file for authentication** box, browse to the key that you generated earlier.

   ![Screenshot of the SSH authentication options](./media/oracle-asm/setprivatekey.png)

7. In the **Category** pane, go to **Connection** > **SSH** > **X11**. Select the **Enable X11 forwarding** check box.

   ![Screenshot of the SSH X11 forwarding options](./media/oracle-asm/enablex11.png)

8. In the **Category** pane, go to **Session**. Enter the host information, and then select **Open**.
