# Disaster Recovery (DR) of Oracle 12c database on an Azure environment

## Assumptions

- Understanding of Oracle Data Guard design and Azure environment


## Goals
- Design the topology and configuration that meet your performance and availability/DR requirements.

## DR Scenario

A customer has an on-premises Oracle database setup on the primary site. A DR site is on a different region. Oracle Data Guard is used for quick recovery between these sites. The primary site also has a secondary database for reporting and other use. 

### Topology

Similar to the customer's existing setup. Here is a summary of the Azure setup.

- Two sites (Primary and DR site)
- Two Virtual Network (Vnet)
- Two Oracle database with Data Guard (primary and standby)
- Two Oracle database with Golden Gate or Data Guard (primary site only)
- Two Application service on primary and one on DR site
- 'Availability set' are used for database and application service on primary site
- One Jumpbox on each site, which restricts access to private network, only allows sign in by administrator
- Jumpbox, application service, database, and VPN gateway are on separate subnets
- NSG is enforced on application and database subnets
