# Create a Windows virtual machine with the Azure CLI 2.0

The Azure CLI 2.0 is used to create and manage Azure resources from the command line or in scripts. This guide details using the Azure CLI to deploy a virtual machine running Windows Server 2016.

Before you start, make sure that the Azure CLI has been installed. For more information, see [Azure CLI installation guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli). 

## Log in to Azure 

Log in to your Azure subscription with the [az login](/cli/azure/#login) command and follow the on-screen directions.

```azurecli
az login
```

## Create a resource group

Create a resource group with [az group create](/cli/azure/group#create). An Azure resource group is a logical container into which Azure resources are deployed and managed. 

The following example creates a resource group named `myResourceGroup` in the `westeurope` location.

```azurecli
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location westeurope
```

## Create virtual machine

Create a VM with [az vm create](/cli/azure/vm#create). 

The following example creates a VM named `myVM`. This example uses `azureuser` for an administrative user name and ` myPassword12` as the password. Update these values to something appropriate to your environment. These values will also be needed when creating a connection with the virtual machine.

```azurecli
az vm create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myVM --image win2016datacenter --admin-username azureuser --admin-password myPassword12
```

When the VM has been created, the Azure CLI shows information similar to the following example. Take note of the public IP address. This address is used to access the VM.

```azurecli
{
  "fqdns": "",
  "id": "/subscriptions/d5b9d4b7-6fc1-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/myVM",
  "location": "westeurope",
  "macAddress": "00-0D-3A-23-9A-49",
  "powerState": "VM running",
  "privateIpAddress": "10.0.0.4",
  "publicIpAddress": "52.174.34.95",
  "resourceGroup": "myResourceGroup"
}
```

## Connect to virtual machine

Use the following command to create an remote desktop session with the virtual machine. Replace the IP address with the public IP address of your virtual machine. When prompted, enter the credentials used when creating the virtual machine.

```bash 
mstsc /v:<Public IP Address>
```

## Delete virtual machine

When no longer needed, the following command can be used to remove the Resource Group, VM, and all related resources.

```azurecli
az group delete --name myResourceGroup
```
