# Back up Linux  virtual machines in Azure

You can protect your data by taking backups at regular intervals. Azure Backup creates recovery points that are stored in geo-redundant recovery vaults. When you restore from a recovery pointy you can restore the whole VM or just specific files. This article explains how to restore a single file to a VM.

## Backup overview

When the Azure Backup service initiates a backup job at the scheduled time, it triggers the backup extension to take a point-in-time snapshot. The Azure Backup service uses the _VMSnapshotLinux_ extension in Linux. The extension is installed during the first VM backup if the VM is running. If the VM is not running, the Backup service takes a snapshot of the underlying storage (since no application writes occur while the VM is stopped).

Once the Azure Backup service takes the snapshot, the data is transferred to the vault. To maximize efficiency, the service identifies and transfers only the blocks of data that have changed since the previous backup.

When the data transfer is complete, the snapshot is removed and a recovery point is created.


## Create a backup
Create a simple scheduled daily backup to a Recovery Services Vault. 

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. In the menu on the left, select **Virtual machines**. 
3. From the list, select a VM to back up.
4. On the VM blade, in the **Settings** section, click **Backup**. The **Enable backup** blade opens.
5. For the [Recovery Services vault](backup-azure-vms-first-look-arm.md#create-a-recovery-services-vault-for-a-vm), click **Create new** and provide the name for the new vault. A new vault is created in the same Resource Group and same location as the virtual machine.
6. Click **Backup policy**. The default policy is to create a backup daily at 8:30 PM and to retain the backup for 180 days. Keep the defaults for this example and click **OK**.

7. On the Enable backup blade, click **Enable Backup**. 
9. Once the configuration has completed, on the VM management blade, click **Backup** to open the Backup Item blade and view the details.

  Until the initial backup has completed, **Last backup status** shows as **Warning(Initial backup pending)**. To see when the next scheduled backup job occurs, under **Backup policy** click the name of the policy. The Backup Policy blade opens and shows the time of the scheduled backup.

10. To create an initial recovery point, on the Backup vault blade click **Backup now**.

11. On the Backup Now blade, click the calendar icon, use the calendar control to select the last day this recovery point is retained, and click **Backup**.

Deployment notifications let you know the backup job has been triggered, and that you can monitor the progress of the job on the Backup jobs page.

## Restore a file


/var/www/html/index.nginx-debian.html


1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
6. In the menu on the left, select **Virtual machines**. 
7. From the list, select the VM.
8. On the VM blade, in the **Settings** section, click **Backup**. The **Backup** blade opens. 
9. In the menu at the top of the blade, select **File Recovery (Preview)**. The **File Recovery (Preview) blade opens.
10. In **Step 1: Select recovery point**, select a recovery point from the drop-down.
11. In **Step 2: Download script to browse and recover files**, click the **Download Executable** button. Save the downloaded file to your local computer.
7. Click **Download script** to download the script file locally.
8. Open a Bash prompt and type the following, replacing *Linux_myVM_05-02-2017.sh* with the correct path and filename for the script that you downloaded, *azureuser* with the username for the VM and *52.166.121.3* with the public IP address for your VM:
    ```bash
	scp test.sh azureuser@52.166.121.3:
	```
9. Open an SSH connection to the VM.
    ```bash
	ssh <publicIpAddress>
	```
10. Add execute permissions to the script file.
    ```bash
	chmod +x Linux_myVM_05-02-2017.sh
	```
11. Run the script to mount the recovery point as a filesystem.
