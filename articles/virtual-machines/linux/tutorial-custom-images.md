# Create a custom image of an Azure VM using the CLI

Custom images are like marketplace images, but you create them yourself. Custom images can be used to bootstrap configurations such as preloading applications, application configurations, and other OS configurations. In this tutorial, you learn how to create your own custom image of an Azure virtual machine.

This tutorial requires the Azure CLI version 2.0.4 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI 2.0]( /cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

To complete the example in this tutorial, you must have an existing virtual machine. If needed, this [script sample](../scripts/virtual-machines-linux-cli-sample-create-vm-nginx.md) can create one for you. When working through the tutorial, replace the resource group and VM names where needed.

## Prepare VM

To create an image of a virtual machine, you need to prepare the VM by deprovisioning, deallocating, and then marking the source VM as generalized.

### Deprovision the VM 

Deprovisioning generalizes the VM by removing machine-specific information. This generalization makes it possible to deploy many VMs from a single image. During deprovisioning, the host name is reset to `localhost.localdomain`. SSH host keys, nameserver configurations, root password, and cached DHCP leases are also deleted.

To deprovision the VM, use the Azure VM agent (waagent). The Azure VM agent is installed on the VM and manages provisioning and interacting with the Azure Fabric Controller. For more information, see the [Azure Linux Agent user guide](agent-user-guide.md).

Connect to your VM using SSH and run the command to deprovision the VM. With the `+user` argument, the last provisioned user account and any associated data are also deleted. Replace the example IP address with the public IP address of your VM.

```bash
ssh azureuser@52.174.34.95 sudo waagent -deprovision+user -force
```
Close the SSH session.

```bash
exit
```

### Deallocate and mark the VM as generalized

To create an image, the VM needs to be deallocated. Deallocate the VM using [az vm deallocate](/cli//azure/vm#deallocate). 
   
```azurecli
az vm deallocate --resource-group myRGCaptureImage --name myVM
```

Finally, set the state of the VM as generalized with [az vm generalize](/cli//azure/vm#generalize).
   
```azurecli
az vm generalize --resource-group myResourceGroupImages --name myVM
```

## Create VM from image

Now you can create an image of the VM by using [az image create](/cli//azure/image#create). The following example creates an image named `myImage` from a VM named `myVM`.
   
```azurecli
az image create --resource-group myResourceGroupImages --name myImage --source myVM
```
 
## Create a VM from an image

You can create a VM using an image with [az vm create](/cli/azure/vm#create). The following example creates a VM named `myVMfromImage` from the image named `myImage`.

```azurecli
az vm create --resource-group myResourceGroupImages --name myVMfromImage --image myImage --admin-username azureuser --generate-ssh-keys
```

## Next steps

In this tutorial, you have learned about creating custom VM images. Advance to the next tutorial to learn about how highly available virtual machines.
