# Create a custom image of an Azure VM using the CLI

To complete this tutorial, you need to have already created a VM using the [How to automate the deployment of Linux virtual machines in Azure](tutorial-automate-vm-deployment.md) tutorial. In the previous tutorial, we showed you how to use a preconfigured Azure Marketplace image to simplify creating a VM. Custom images are similar to marketplace images, but you create them yourself based on your own Azure VMs. A custom image of a VM is a copy of your VM, including all of the attached data disks. 

In this tutorial, we will create a custom image of the VM from the previous tutorial and then use the custom image to create a new VM. 

To complete this tutorial, make sure that you have installed the latest [Azure CLI 2.0](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Create an image

To create an image of a virtual machine, you need to prepare the VM by deprovisioning, deallocating the VM and generalizing the existing VM. After the VM has been prepared, you can take the image.

### Deprovision the VM 

To make the VM ready for generalizing, you deprovision the VM using the Azure VM agent to delete files and data. Use the **waagent** command with the **deprovision** parameter on your source Linux VM. For more information, see the [Azure Linux Agent user guide](../windows/agent-user-guide.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2flinux%2ftoc.json).

Connect to your Linux VM using SSH. Replace the example IP address with the public IP address of your VM.

```bash
ssh 52.174.34.95
```

Run the following command to deprovision the VM
   
```bash
sudo waagent -deprovision+user -force
```

Close the SSH session.

```bash
exit
```

### Generalize the VM

Generalizing a VM removes , generalizes the `myVM` virtual machine in the in the `myResourceGroup` resource group. It also creates an image named `myImage` in the same resource group.

Deallocate the VM that you deprovisioned with [az vm deallocate](/cli//azure/vm#deallocate). 
   
```azurecli
az vm deallocate --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myVM
```

Generalize the VM with [az vm generalize](/cli//azure/vm#generalize). 
   
```azurecli
az vm generalize --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myVM
```

### Capture the image

Now create an image of the VM by using [az image create](/cli//azure/image#create). The following example creates an image named `myImage` in the resource group named `myResourceGroup` using the VM named `myAutomatedVM` as the source:
   
```azurecli
az image create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myImage --source myVM
```
 
## Step 2 - Create VM from image

Create a VM using the image by using [az vm create](/cli/azure/vm#create). You can create VMs in any resource group within your subscription from this image, but we will create our new VM in the same `myResourceGroup` resource group as the source VM. The following example creates a VM named `myVMfromImage` from the image named `myImage`.

Create the VM.

```azurecli
az vm create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myVMfromImage --image myImage --admin-username azureuser --generate-ssh-keys
```
