# Monitor Linux VM security with the Azure Security Center

Azure Security Center helps you prevent, detect, and respond to threats with increased visibility into and control over the security of your Azure resources. It provides integrated security monitoring and policy management across your Azure subscriptions, helps detect threats that might otherwise go unnoticed, and works with a broad ecosystem of security solutions. This tutorial describes how to used Azure Security Center with Linux virtual machines.

## Security Center overview

Azure security center helps you identify potential Azure VM configuration issues and targeted threats. Some examples include identifying VMs with missing network security groups, no data encryption, or missing an anti-virus solution. This information is presented in the Azure security center dashboard in easily consumable graphs.  

Azure security center extends beyond data discovery also allowing for auto-remediation of common issues. For instance, if a VM has been deployed without an attached network security group, Azure security center flags this as an issue, and offer a recommendation that a network security group should be created for the VM. You are then given an option to create an attach a NSG directly from within the Azure security center recommendation blade.

The Azure security center dashboard can be accessed by clicking on **Security Center** on the left-hand navigation pane of the Azure portal. The dashboard provides high level view of resource health, security alerts, and configuration recommendations. From here you can easily asses the security health of your Azure environment, find a count of current recommendations, and asses the current state of detected security alerts. Each of these high-level charts can be expanded, which provides more detail into the area of focus.

## Configure data collection

Before you can gain visibility into VM security configurations, Azure security center data collection needs to be configured. This involves enabling data collection and creating and Azure storage account to hold the collected data. To do so:

1. From the Azure security center dashboard click on **Security Policy** and then select your subscription. 
2. Under **Data collection**, select the **On** selector.
3. Click on **Choose a storage account** and create a new storage account.
4. Select **OK** when done.
5. Click **Save** on the **Security Policy** blade. 

## Configure virtual machine

When deploying a virtual machine in Azure, the VM is automatically configured with the security center data collection agent, and is auto enrolled in Azure security center. If you already have VMs in your Azure subscription, these should be immediately visible. If you need a VM, the following CLI commands creates one for you.

```azurecli
# Create a resource group.
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location westus

# Create a new virtual machine, thisaz vm  creates SSH keys if not present.
az vm create --resource-group myResourceGroup --name myVM --image UbuntuLTS --generate-ssh-keys
```

With a VM ready to go, return to the Azure security center dashboard. Under **Resource security health** click on **Compute**. Finally, on the **Compute** blade, click on **Virtual machines**. This view provides a summary view of the configuration status for all VMs.

## Configure security policy

A security policy defines the security controls for which data is collected and recommendations are made.  By default, Azure resources are evaluated against all recommendations. Individual configuration can be disabled globally for all Azure resource, or disabled per resource group. This gives youâ€™re the ability to apply different security policies to different sets of Azure resources. 

To configure an Azure security center security policy for all Azure resources:

1. From the Azure security center dashboard click on **Security Policy** and then select your subscription. 
2. Click on **Prevention policy**.
3. Enable or disable the policies that need to be applied to all Azure resources.
4. Click **OK** when done.
5. Click **Save** on the **Security Policy** blade. 

To configure a policy for a specific resource group, follow the same steps, however instead of selecting the subscription on the security policy blade, select a resource group. When configuring the policy, select **Unique** under **Inheritance**. 

## Remediate issues

Once Azure security center begins to populate with configuration data, recommendations are made against the configured security policy. For instance, if a VM has been configured without an associated network security group, a recommendation is made to create one. To see a list of all recommendations: 

1. From the Azure security center dashboard click on **Recommendations**.
2. Select a specific recommendation.  
3. Select a specific recommendation, this opens a blade with a list of all resources for which the recommendation applies.
4. Select a specific resource for which you would like to address.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions for remediation steps. 

In many cases, Azure security center provides actionable steps for addressing the recommendation without leaving the context of Azure security center.  For instance, in the following example an NSG was detected with an unrestricted inbound rule. From this recommendation the **Edit inbound rule** button can be selected which provides the proper UI needed to modify the rule.
