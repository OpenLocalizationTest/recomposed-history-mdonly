# Manage Azure Virtual Networks and Linux Virtual Machines with the Azure CLI

In this tutorial, Azure virtual machine networking is detailed. In working through this tutorial, you will create two virtual machines, network these VMs, and secure network traffic to and from these VMs.

To complete this tutorial, make sure that you have installed the latest [Azure CLI 2.0](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Step 1 - Create front end VM 

When creating an Azure virtual machine networking resources are automatically created for you. These include:

- Virtual network – Azure network used for communication between Azure resources. 
- Virtual network interface - Connects an Azure virtual machine to the Azure network.
- Public IP address – Connects a virtual machine to the public internet.
- Network security group -Secures incoming and outgoing virtual machine network traffic.
- Network security group rules -  rules that allow or deny traffic on specific network ports.

Before creating a VM, create a resource group using the [az group create](/cli/azure/group#create) command. 

```azurecli
az group create --name myTutorial2 --location westus
```

Create a VM using the [az vm create](/cli/azure/vm#create) command. 

```azurecli
az vm create --resource-group myTutorial2 --name myVM2 --image UbuntuLTS --generate-ssh-keys
```

Once the VM has been created, take note of the public IP address, this will be used in later steps of this tutorial.

```bash
{
  "fqdns": "",
  "id": "/subscriptions/d5b9d4b7-6fc1-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/myVM",
  "location": "westus",
  "macAddress": "00-0D-3A-23-9A-49",
  "powerState": "VM running",
  "privateIpAddress": "10.0.0.4",
  "publicIpAddress": "40.68.254.142",
  "resourceGroup": "myTutorial2"
}
```

## Step 2 - Allow web traffic

In the previous step a VM was deployed with an NGINX image. However, until a network security group rule has been created for port 80, the NGINX webserver is inaccessible. 

Use the [az vm open-port](/cli/azure/vm#open-port) command to open port 80.

```azurecli
az vm open-port --port 80 --resource-group myTutorial2 --name myVM
```

Now browse to the public IP address of the virtual machine and you will see an NGINX stack site. 

## Step 3 - Create back end NSG

In the previous set of exercises a single virtual machine was created, networking resources automatically created, and port 80 opened for web traffic. This will now be expanded on by creating a second virtual machine (back end). The back end virtual machine will not be exposed to the internet, and will only allow incoming traffic from the first virtual machine.

Use the [az network nsg create](/cli/azure/network/nsg#create) command to create a new network security group. This NSG will be used to control traffic to the backend VM(s).

```azurecli
az network nsg create --resource-group myTutorial2 --name myBackendNSG
```

## Step 4 - Create back end subnet

A new subnet will be created for the back end virtual machine. In this case, the network security group is attached to the subnet as opposed to a virtual machines network card, as seen in the previous example. When an NSG is attached to a subnet, the NSG rules will apply to all VMs that are also attached to the subnet.

Use the [az network vnet subnet create](/cli/azure/network/vnet/subnet#create) command to create the subnet. The `--network-security-group` argument is used to specify the NSG to use.

```azurecli
az network vnet subnet create \
 --address-prefix 10.0.1.0/24 \
 --name myBackendSubnet \
 --resource-group myTutorial2 \
 --vnet-name myVMVNET \
 --network-security-group myBackendNSG
```

## Step 5 - Create back end VM

Now that a NSG and subnet has been created, create a new virtual machine. In this example, the VM is attached to the subnet using the `--subnet` argument. Also note that the `--public-ip-address` argument has a value of empty quotes. This indicates that no public IP address will be created.

```azurecli
az vm create \
  --resource-group myTutorial2 \
  --name myVM2 \
  --image UbuntuLTS \
  --generate-ssh-keys \
  --subnet myBackendSubnet \
  --vnet-name myVMVNET \
  --public-ip-address ""
```

## Step 6 - Secure outbound traffic

Use the [az network nsg rule create]( /cli/azure/network/nsg/rule#create) command to create an NSG rule that denies all internet bound traffic from the back end virtual machine.

```azurecli
az network nsg rule create \
 --resource-group myTutorial2 \
 --nsg-name myBackendNSG \
 --name web-rule \
 --access Deny \
 --protocol Tcp  \
 --direction Outbound  \
 --priority 200 \
 --source-address-prefix "*" \
 --source-port-range "*" \
 --destination-address-prefix "*" \
 --destination-port-range "*"
```

## Step 7 - Secure traffic between VMs

Finally, inbound traffic to the back end virtual machine will be limited such that only traffic on port 22, originating from the front-end subnet will be allowed.  In this configuration the back-end VM is not accessible from the internet, however the front-end VM can be used as a ‘jump box’ for accessing the back-end VM.

Use the [az network nsg rule create]( /cli/azure/network/nsg/rule#create) command to create an NSG rule limiting traffic.

```azurecli
az network nsg rule create \
 --resource-group myTutorial2 \
 --nsg-name myBackendNSG \
 --name com-rule \
 --access Allow \
 --protocol Tcp \
 --direction Inbound \
 --priority 100 \
 --source-address-prefix 10.0.0.0/24 \
 --source-port-range "*" \
 --destination-address-prefix "*" \
 --destination-port-range 22
```

When completed, the VM and network configuration looks like this.

## Step 7 - Delete resource group

Delete the resource group, which deletes all virtual machines and related networking resources.

```azurecli
az group delete --name myTutorial2 --no-wait --yes
```
