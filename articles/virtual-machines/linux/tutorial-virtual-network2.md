# Manage Azure Virtual Networks and Linux Virtual Machines with the Azure CLI

In this tutorial, you create two virtual machines and configure network connectivity and security between these VMs. When completed a ‘front-end’ VM will be accessible from the internet on port 22 for SSH and port 80 for HTTP connections. A ‘back-end’ VM will only be accessible from the front-end vm on port 22.

To complete this tutorial, make sure that you have installed the latest [Azure CLI 2.0](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).

## Step 1 - Create front-end VM 

When creating an Azure virtual machine, networking resources are automatically created for you. These resources include:

- **Virtual network** – Azure network used for communication between Azure resources. 
- **Virtual network interface** - Connects an Azure virtual machine to the Azure network.
- **Public IP address** – Connects a virtual machine to the public internet.
- **Network security group** - Secures incoming and outgoing virtual machine network traffic. When an NSG is auto-created, it is attached to the network interface of the VM. In this configuration the NSG applies only to the VM.
- **Network security group rules** - allow or deny traffic on specific network ports. When cresting a Linux VM, a rule for port 22 is automatically created.

Before creating a VM, create a resource group using the [az group create](/cli/azure/group#create) command. 

```azurecli
az group create --name myTutorial2 --location westus
```

Create a VM using the [az vm create](/cli/azure/vm#create) command. 

```azurecli
az vm create --resource-group myTutorial2 --name myVM --image UbuntuLTS --generate-ssh-keys
```

Once the VM has been created, take note of the public IP address, this address is used in later steps of this tutorial.

```bash
{
  "fqdns": "",
  "id": "/subscriptions/d5b9d4b7-6fc1-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/myResourceGroup/providers/Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/myVM",
  "location": "westus",
  "macAddress": "00-0D-3A-23-9A-49",
  "powerState": "VM running",
  "privateIpAddress": "10.0.0.4",
  "publicIpAddress": "40.68.254.142",
  "resourceGroup": "myTutorial2"
}
```

## Step 2 - Install web server

Create an SSH connection with the virtual machine. Replace the example IP address with the public IP address of the VM.

```bash
ssh 40.58.254.142
```

Run the following commands to install NGINX

```bash
sudo apt-get -y update && sudo apt-get -y install nginx
```

Close the SSH session.

```bash
exit
```

## Step 2 - Allow web traffic

In the previous steps, a VM was deployed and NGINX installed. Until a network security group rule has been created for port 80, the NGINX web server is inaccessible. 

Use the [az vm open-port](/cli/azure/vm#open-port) command to open port 80.

```azurecli
az vm open-port --port 80 --resource-group myTutorial2 --name myVM
```

Now browse to the public IP address of the virtual machine to see the NGINX site.

## Step 3 - Create back-end NSG

In the previous set of exercises a single virtual machine was created, networking resources automatically created, and port 80 opened for web traffic. This configuration will now be expanded on by creating a second virtual machine. Because the back-end VM will require some custom network configuration, network resources will be created before the virtual machine. 

Use the [az network nsg create](/cli/azure/network/nsg#create) command to create a network security group.

```azurecli
az network nsg create --resource-group myTutorial2 --name myBackendNSG
```

## Step 4 - Create back-end subnet

Created a subnet for the back-end virtual machine. In this case, the network security group is attached to the subnet as opposed to a virtual machines network card, as seen in the previous example. When an NSG is attached to a subnet, the NSG rules applies to all VMs attached to the subnet.

Use the [az network vnet subnet create](/cli/azure/network/vnet/subnet#create) command to create the subnet. The `--network-security-group` argument is used to specify the Network security group..

```azurecli
az network vnet subnet create \
 --address-prefix 10.0.1.0/24 \
 --name myBackendSubnet \
 --resource-group myTutorial2 \
 --vnet-name myVMVNET \
 --network-security-group myBackendNSG
```

## Step 5 - Create back-end VM

Now that an NSG and subnet has been created, create a new virtual machine. In this example, the VM is attached to the subnet using the `--subnet` argument. Also note that the `--public-ip-address` argument has a value of empty quotes. The empty quotes indicate that no public IP address is created.

```azurecli
az vm create \
  --resource-group myTutorial2 \
  --name myVM2 \
  --image UbuntuLTS \
  --generate-ssh-keys \
  --subnet myBackendSubnet \
  --vnet-name myVMVNET \
  --public-ip-address ""
```

## Step 6 - Secure outbound traffic

Use the [az network nsg rule create]( /cli/azure/network/nsg/rule#create) command to create an NSG rule that denies all internet bound traffic from the back-end virtual machine.

```azurecli
az network nsg rule create \
 --resource-group myTutorial2 \
 --nsg-name myBackendNSG \
 --name web-rule \
 --access Deny \
 --protocol Tcp  \
 --direction Outbound  \
 --priority 200 \
 --source-address-prefix "*" \
 --source-port-range "*" \
 --destination-address-prefix "*" \
 --destination-port-range "*"
```

## Step 7 - Secure traffic between VMs

Finally, inbound traffic to the back-end virtual machine is limited such that only traffic on port 22, originating from the front-end subnet is allowed.  In this configuration, the back-end VM is not accessible from the internet. The front-end VM however can be used as a ‘jump box’ for accessing the back-end VM.

Use the [az network nsg rule create]( /cli/azure/network/nsg/rule#create) command to create an NSG rule limiting traffic.

```azurecli
az network nsg rule create \
 --resource-group myTutorial2 \
 --nsg-name myBackendNSG \
 --name com-rule \
 --access Allow \
 --protocol Tcp \
 --direction Inbound \
 --priority 100 \
 --source-address-prefix 10.0.0.0/24 \
 --source-port-range "*" \
 --destination-address-prefix "*" \
 --destination-port-range 22
```

## Step 7 - Delete resource group

Delete the resource group, which deletes all virtual machines and related networking resources.

```azurecli
az group delete --name myTutorial2 --no-wait --yes
```
