# Troubleshooting: Linux VM Device Names are changed

The article explains why Device Names are changed after you restart a Linux virtual machine (VM), or reattach the disks. It also provides the solution for this problem.

## Symptom

You may experience the following problems when running Linux VMs in Microsoft Azure.

- Fail to boot after a restart.

- If data disks are detached and reattached, the devices names for disks are changed.

- An application or script referencing a disk by using device name fails. You find that the device name of disk is changed.

## Cause

Device Names in Linux are not guaranteed to be consistent across restarts. Device Names are made up of major (letter) and minor numbers. When the Linux storage device driver detects a new device, it assigns major and minor device numbers to it from the available range. When a device is removed, the device numbers are freed for reuse.

Azure does not guarantee that disks will be presented to the operating system in the same order after every restart. Additionally, detaching and reattaching disk in a different order while a Linux VM is running may cause the device name to change when the numbers are reused.

## Solution

To address this issue, use persistent naming. For example, device and partition UUIDs are considered stable, and are used as a best practice in fstab and to discover Device Names. For more information about how to configure a Linux VM to use a UUID when adding a data disk, see [Connect to the Linux VM to mount the new disk](add-disk.md#connect-to-the-linux-vm-to-mount-the-new-disk).

The use of the [mount option *nofail*](http://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/fstab.5.html) for partitions on data disks in fstab is also recommended to prevent boot failures in Azure.

When the Azure Linux agent is installed on a VM, it uses Udev rules to construct a set of symbolic links under **/dev/disk/azure**. These Udev rules can be used by applications and scripts to identify disks are attached to the VM, their type, and the LUN.

## More Information

A script or application can read the output of blkid, or similar sources of information, and construct symbolic links under **/dev** for use. The output will show the UUIDs of all disks attached to the VM and the device file to which they are associated:

    **$ sudo blkid -s UUID**

    -------------an example of the output from this command ------------------
    /dev/sr0: UUID="120B021372645f72"
    /dev/sda1: UUID="52c6959b-79b0-4bdd-8ed6-71e0ba782fb4"
    /dev/sdb1: UUID="176250df-9c7c-436f-94e4-d13f9bdea744"
    /dev/sdc1: UUID="b0048738-4ecc-4837-9793-49ce296d2692"

The waagent udev rules construct a set of symbolic links under **/dev/disk/azure**:


    $ ls -l /dev/disk/azure**

    -------------an example of the output from this command ------------------
    total 0
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  9 Jun  2 23:17 resource -> ../../sdb
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 Jun  2 23:17 resource-part1 -> ../../sdb1
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root  9 Jun  2 23:17 root -> ../../sda
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 Jun  2 23:17 root-part1 -> ../../sda1


The application can use this information identify the boot disk device and the resource (ephemeral) disk. In Azure, applications should refer to **/dev/disk/azure/root-part1** or **/dev/disk/azure-resource-part1** to discover these partitions.

If there are additional partitions from the blkid list, they reside on a data disk. Applications can persist the UUID for these partitions and use a path like the below to discover the device name at runtime:

    $ ls -l /dev/disk/by-uuid/b0048738-4ecc-4837-9793-49ce296d2692

    ----------------an example of the output from this command ------------------
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 10 Jun 19 15:57 /dev/disk/by-uuid/b0048738-4ecc-4837-9793-49ce296d2692 -> ../../sdc1

Alternatively, an application could use LUNs for the purpose of finding all the attached disks and constructing symbolic links. The Azure Linux agent now comes with udev rules that set up symbolic links from LUN to the devices:

    $ tree /dev/disk/azure

    ----------------an example of the output from this command ------------------
    /dev/disk/azure
    ├── resource -> ../../sdb
    ├── resource-part1 -> ../../sdb1
    ├── root -> ../../sda
    ├── root-part1 -> ../../sda1
    └── scsi1
        ├── lun0 -> ../../../sdc
        ├── lun0-part1 -> ../../../sdc1
        ├── lun1 -> ../../../sdd
        ├── lun1-part1 -> ../../../sdd1
        ├── lun1-part2 -> ../../../sdd2
        └── lun1-part3 -> ../../../sdd3                                    
                                 

LUN information can also be retrieved from the Linux guest using lsscsi or similar tooling.

       sudo lsscsi
    ----------------an example of the output from this command ------------------
      \[1:0:0:0\] cd/dvd Msft Virtual CD/ROM 1.0 /dev/sr0

      \[2:0:0:0\] disk Msft Virtual Disk 1.0 /dev/sda

      \[3:0:1:0\] disk Msft Virtual Disk 1.0 /dev/sdb

      \[5:0:0:0\] disk Msft Virtual Disk 1.0 /dev/sdc

      \[5:0:0:1\] disk Msft Virtual Disk 1.0 /dev/sdd

This guest LUN information can be used with Azure subscription metadata to identify the location in Azure storage of the VHD which stores the partition data. For example, using the az cli:

    $ az vm show --resource-group testVM --name testVM | jq -r .storageProfile.dataDisks                                        
    [
