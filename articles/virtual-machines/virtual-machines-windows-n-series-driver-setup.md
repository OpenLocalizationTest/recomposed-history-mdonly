# Set up GPU drivers for N-series VMs
To take advantage of the GPU capabilities of Azure N-series VMs running Windows Server, you must install NVIDA drivers on each VM after deployment. This article provides basic setup instructions. This article is also available for [Linux VMs](virtual-machines-linux-n-series-driver-setup?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2flinux%2ftoc.json).

For basic specs, storage capacities, and disk details, see [Sizes for virtual machines](virtual-machines-windows-sizes.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2fwindows%2ftoc.json).

For more information about the NVIDA GPUs on the N-series VMs, see:
* [NVIDIA Tesla K80](http://www.nvidia.com/object/tesla-k80.html) (for Azure NC VMs)
* [NVIDIA Tesla M60](http://www.nvidia.com/object/tesla-m60.html) (for Azure NV VMs)


## Supported GPU drivers

Connect to each N-series VM by RDP. Download and install the latest Tesla driver for your Windows operating system on each VM. 

| Operating system | Driver download |
| --- | --- | 
| Windows Server 2016 | [Version 369.73](http://www.nvidia.com/download/driverResults.aspx/111404/) |
| Windows Server 2012 R2 | [Version 369.73](http://www.nvidia.com/download/driverResults.aspx/111404/) |


Browse additional drivers at [NVIDIA driver downloads](http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?).

> [!NOTE]
> Developers building GPU-accelerated applications for the NVIDIA K80 can download and install the [CUDA Toolkit 8](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads).
>
## Verify driver installation

In Device Manager:

To query the GPU device state, run the [nvidia-smi](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-system-management-interface) command-line utility installed with the driver.
