# How to Log on to a virtual machine running Windows Server#

You'll use the **Connect** button in the Azure preview portal to start a Remote Desktop session. First you'll connect to the virtual machine, then you'll log on.

Want to connect to a Linux VM? See [How to log on to a virtual machine running Linux](virtual-machines-linux-how-to-log-on.md).

## Troubleshooting tips

Here are a few things to try quickly in the portal:

-	For problems with the Remote Desktop connection, try resetting the configuration. From the virtual machine dashboard, under **Quick Glance**, click **Reset remote configuration**.
-	For problems with your password, try resetting it. From the virtual machine dashboard, under **Quick Glance**, click **Reset password**.

If those don't work, you'll need to do more extensive troubleshooting. For instructions, see [Troubleshoot Remote Desktop connections to a Windows-based Azure Virtual Machine](virtual-machines-troubleshoot-remote-desktop-connections.md).
