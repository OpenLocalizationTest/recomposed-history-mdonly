You cannot remote desktop to a Microsoft Azure Windows Virtual Machine (VM) after you disable the default Network Interface (NIC) or manually sets a static IP for the NIC. This article shows how to reset the network interface for Azure Windows VM, which will resolve this issue.

## Reset network interface

### For Classic VMs

To reset network interface, follow these steps:

1.	Go to the [Azure Portal]( https://ms.portal.azure.com).
2.	Select **Virtual Machines (Classic)**.
3.	Select the affected Virtual Machine.
4.	Select **IP addresses**.
5.	If the the **Private IP assignment**  is not  **Static**, change it to **Static**.
6.	Change the **IP adreess** to another IP address that is available in the Subnet.
7.	Select Save.
8.	The virtual machine will restart to initialize the new NIC to the system.
9.	Try to RDP to your machine.	If successful, you can change the Private IP address back to the original if you would like. Otherwise, you can keep it. 

### For VMs delopyed in Resource group model

1.	Go to the [Azure Portal]( https://ms.portal.azure.com).
2.	Select the affected Virtual Machine.
3.	Select **Network Interfaces**.
4.	Select the Network Interface associated with your machine
5.	Select **IP configurations**.
6.	Select the IP. 
7.	If the the **Private IP assignment**  is not  **Static**, change it to **Static**.
8.	Change the **IP adreess** to another IP address that is available in the Subnet.
9. The virtual machine will restart to initialize the new NIC to the system.
10.	Try to RDP to your machine.	If successful, you can change the Private IP address back to the original if you would like. Otherwise, you can keep it. 
 


## Delete the unavailable NICs
After you can remote desktop to the machine, you must delete the old NICs to avoid the potential problem:

12.	Open Device Manager.
13.	Select **View** > **Show hidden devices**.
14.	Select **Network Adapters**. 
15.	Here you should see some adapters named as "Microsoft Hyper-V Network Adapter.
16.	You might see one with that name that is greyed out. Right click the adaprter and then select Uninstall.

>[NOTE!]
>You should only uninstall gayed out adapters that have the name "Microsoft Hyper-V Network Adapter". If you uninstall any of the other hidden adapters it could cause additional issues.

18.	Now all unavailable NICs should be cleared out from your system, and you should no longer experience the issues.
