# Create a VM from a specialized disk

Create a new VM by attaching a specialized managed disk as the OS disk using Powershell. A specialized disk is a copy of VHD from an existing VM that maintains the user accounts, applications and other state data from your original VM. 

You have two options:
* [Upload a VHD] 
* [Copy the VHD of an existing Azure VM]

This topic shows you how to use managed disks, if you have a legacy deployment that requires using a storage account, see [Create a VM from a specialized VHD in a storage account](sa-create-vm-specialized.md)

## Before you begin
If you use PowerShell, make sure that you have the latest version of the AzureRM.Compute PowerShell module. Run the following command to install it.

```powershell
Install-Module AzureRM.Compute -RequiredVersion 2.6.0
```
For more information, see [Azure PowerShell Versioning](/powershell/azure/overview).


## Option 1: Upload a specialized VHD

You can upload the VHD from a specialized VM created with an on-premises virtualization tool, like Hyper-V, or a VM exported from another cloud.

## Prepare the VM
If you intend to use the VHD as-is to create a new VM, ensure the following steps are completed. 
  
  * [Prepare a Windows VHD to upload to Azure](prepare-for-upload-vhd-image.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2fwindows%2ftoc.json). **Do not** generalize the VM using Sysprep.
  * Remove any guest virtualization tools and agents that are installed on the VM (i.e. VMware tools).
  * Ensure the VM is configured to pull its IP address and DNS settings via DHCP. This ensures that the server obtains an IP address within the VNet when it starts up. 


### Get the storage account
You need a storage account in Azure to store the uploaded VM image. You can either use an existing storage account or create a new one. 

To show the available storage accounts, type:

```powershell
Get-AzureRmStorageAccount
```

If you want to use an existing storage account, proceed to the [Upload the VM image](#upload-the-vm-vhd-to-your-storage-account) section.

If you need to create a storage account, follow these steps:

1. You need the name of the resource group where the storage account should be created. To find out all the resource groups that are in your subscription, type:
   
    ```powershell
    Get-AzureRmResourceGroup
    ```

    To create a resource group named **myResourceGroup** in the **West US** region, type:

    ```powershell
    New-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name myResourceGroup -Location "West US"
    ```

2. Create a storage account named **mystorageaccount** in this resource group by using the [New-AzureRmStorageAccount](/powershell/module/azurerm.storage/new-azurermstorageaccount) cmdlet:
   
    ```powershell
    New-AzureRmStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup -Name mystorageaccount -Location "West US" `
        -SkuName "Standard_LRS" -Kind "Storage"
    ```
   
    Valid values for -SkuName are:
   
   * **Standard_LRS** - Locally redundant storage. 
   * **Standard_ZRS** - Zone redundant storage.
   * **Standard_GRS** - Geo redundant storage. 
   * **Standard_RAGRS** - Read access geo redundant storage. 
   * **Premium_LRS** - Premium locally redundant storage. 

### Upload the VHD to your storage account
Use the [Add-AzureRmVhd](/powershell/module/azurerm.compute/add-azurermvhd) cmdlet to upload the image to a container in your storage account. This example uploads the file **myVHD.vhd** from `"C:\Users\Public\Documents\Virtual hard disks\"` to a storage account named **mystorageaccount** in the **myResourceGroup** resource group. The file will be placed into the container named **mycontainer** and the new file name will be **myUploadedVHD.vhd**.

```powershell
$rgName = "myResourceGroup"
$urlOfUploadedImageVhd = "https://mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/myUploadedVHD.vhd"
Add-AzureRmVhd -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Destination $urlOfUploadedImageVhd `
    -LocalFilePath "C:\Users\Public\Documents\Virtual hard disks\myVHD.vhd"
```


If successful, you get a response that looks similar to this:

```powershell
MD5 hash is being calculated for the file C:\Users\Public\Documents\Virtual hard disks\myVHD.vhd.
MD5 hash calculation is completed.
Elapsed time for the operation: 00:03:35
Creating new page blob of size 53687091712...
Elapsed time for upload: 01:12:49

LocalFilePath           DestinationUri
-------------           --------------
C:\Users\Public\Doc...  https://mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/myUploadedVHD.vhd
```

Depending on your network connection and the size of your VHD file, this command may take a while to complete


## Option 2: Copy the VHD from an existing Azure VM

You can create a copy of the VHD for a VM in another storage account to use when creating a new, duplicate VM.

### Before you begin
Make sure that you:

* Have information about the **source and destination storage accounts**. For the source VM, you need to have the storage account and container names. Usually, the container name will be **vhds**. You also need to have a destination storage account. If you don't already have one, you can create one using either the portal (**More Services** > Storage accounts > Add) or using the [New-AzureRmStorageAccount](/powershell/module/azurerm.storage/new-azurermstorageaccount) cmdlet. 
* Have Azure [PowerShell 1.0](/powershell/azure/overview) (or later) installed.
* Have downloaded and installed the [AzCopy tool](../../storage/storage-use-azcopy.md). 

### Deallocate the VM
Deallocate the VM, which frees up the VHD to be copied. 

* **Portal**: Click **Virtual machines** > **myVM** > Stop
* **Powershell**: `Stop-AzureRmVM -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup -Name myVM` deallocates the VM named **myVM** in resource group **myResourceGroup**.

The **Status** for the VM in the Azure portal changes from **Stopped** to **Stopped (deallocated)**.

### Get the storage account URLs
You need the URLs of the source and destination storage accounts. The URLs look like: `https://<storageaccount>.blob.core.windows.net/<containerName>/`. If you already know the storage account and container name, you can just replace the information between the brackets to create your URL. 

You can use the Azure portal or Azure Powershell to get the URL:

* **Portal**: Click **More services** > **Storage accounts** > <storage account> **Blobs** and your source VHD file is probably in the **vhds** container. Click **Properties** for the container, and copy the text labeled **URL**. You'll need the URLs of both the source and destination containers. 
* **Powershell**: `Get-AzureRmVM -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup" -Name "myVM"` gets the information for VM named **myVM** in the resource group **myResourceGroup**. In the results, look in the **Storage profile** section for the **Vhd Uri**. The first part of the Uri is the URL to the container and the last part is the OS VHD name for the VM.

## Get the storage access keys
Find the access keys for the source and destination storage accounts. For more information about access keys, see [About Azure storage accounts](../../storage/storage-create-storage-account.md).

* **Portal**: Click **More services** > **Storage accounts** > <storage account> **All Settings** > **Access keys**. Copy the key labeled as **key1**.
* **Powershell**: `Get-AzureRmStorageAccountKey -Name mystorageaccount -ResourceGroupName myResourceGroup` gets the storage key for the storage account **mystorageaccount** in the resource group **myResourceGroup**. Copy the key labeled as **key1**.

### Copy the VHD
You can copy files between storage accounts using AzCopy. For the destination container, if the specified container doesn't exist, it will be created for you. 

To use AzCopy, open a command prompt on your local machine and navigate to the folder where AzCopy is installed. It will be similar to *C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Azure\AzCopy*. 

To copy all of the files within a container, you use the **/S** switch. This can be used to copy the OS VHD and all of the data disks if they are in the same container. This example shows how to copy all of the files in the container **mysourcecontainer** in storage account **mysourcestorageaccount** to the container **mydestinationcontainer** in the **mydestinationstorageaccount** storage account. Replace the names of the storage accounts and containers with your own. Replace `<sourceStorageAccountKey1>` and `<destinationStorageAccountKey1>` with your own keys.

```
AzCopy /Source:https://mysourcestorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mysourcecontainer `
    /Dest:https://mydestinationatorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mydestinationcontainer `
    /SourceKey:<sourceStorageAccountKey1> /DestKey:<destinationStorageAccountKey1> /S
```

If you only want to copy a specific VHD in a container with multiple files, you can also specify the file name using the /Pattern switch. In this example, only the file named **myFileName.vhd** will be copied.

```
AzCopy /Source:https://mysourcestorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mysourcecontainer `
  /Dest:https://mydestinationatorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mydestinationcontainer `
  /SourceKey:<sourceStorageAccountKey1> /DestKey:<destinationStorageAccountKey1> `
  /Pattern:myFileName.vhd
```


When it is finished, you will get a message that looks something like:

```
Finished 2 of total 2 file(s).
[2016/10/07 17:37:41] Transfer summary:
-----------------
Total files transferred: 2
Transfer successfully:   2
Transfer skipped:        0
Transfer failed:         0
Elapsed time:            00.00:13:07
```

### Troubleshooting
* When you use AZCopy, if you see the error "Server failed to authenticate the request", make sure the value of the Authorization header is formed correctly including the signature. If you are using Key 2 or the secondary storage key, try using the primary or 1st storage key.

## Create the new VM 

You need to create networking and other VM resources to be used by the new VM.

### Create the subNet and vNet

Create the vNet and subNet of the [virtual network](../../virtual-network/virtual-networks-overview.md).

1. Create the subNet. This example creates a subnet named **mySubNet**, in the resource group **myResourceGroup**, and sets the subnet address prefix to **10.0.0.0/24**.
   
    ```powershell
    $rgName = "myResourceGroup"
    $subnetName = "mySubNet"
    $singleSubnet = New-AzureRmVirtualNetworkSubnetConfig -Name $subnetName -AddressPrefix 10.0.0.0/24
    ```
2. Create the vNet. This example sets the virtual network name to be **myVnetName**, the location to **West US**, and the address prefix for the virtual network to **10.0.0.0/16**. 
   
    ```powershell
    $location = "West US"
    $vnetName = "myVnetName"
    $vnet = New-AzureRmVirtualNetwork -Name $vnetName -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Location $location `
        -AddressPrefix 10.0.0.0/16 -Subnet $singleSubnet
    ```    

### Create a public IP address and NIC
To enable communication with the virtual machine in the virtual network, you need a [public IP address](../../virtual-network/virtual-network-ip-addresses-overview-arm.md) and a network interface.

1. Create the public IP. In this example, the public IP address name is set to **myIP**.
   
    ```powershell
    $ipName = "myIP"
    $pip = New-AzureRmPublicIpAddress -Name $ipName -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Location $location `
        -AllocationMethod Dynamic
    ```       
2. Create the NIC. In this example, the NIC name is set to **myNicName**.
   
    ```powershell
    $nicName = "myNicName"
    $nic = New-AzureRmNetworkInterface -Name $nicName -ResourceGroupName $rgName `
	-Location $location -SubnetId $vnet.Subnets[0].Id -PublicIpAddressId $pip.Id
	```

### Create the network security group and an RDP rule
To be able to log in to your VM using RDP, you need to have an security rule that allows RDP access on port 3389. Because the VHD for the new VM was created from an existing specialized VM, after the VM is created you can use an existing account from the source virtual machine that had permission to log on using RDP.
This example sets the NSG name to **myNsg** and the RDP rule name to **myRdpRule**.

```powershell
$nsgName = "myNsg"

$rdpRule = New-AzureRmNetworkSecurityRuleConfig -Name myRdpRule -Description "Allow RDP" `
    -Access Allow -Protocol Tcp -Direction Inbound -Priority 110 `
    -SourceAddressPrefix Internet -SourcePortRange * `
    -DestinationAddressPrefix * -DestinationPortRange 3389
$nsg = New-AzureRmNetworkSecurityGroup -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Location $location `
    -Name $nsgName -SecurityRules $rdpRule
	
```

For more information about endpoints and NSG rules, see [Opening ports to a VM in Azure using PowerShell](nsg-quickstart-powershell.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-machines%2fwindows%2ftoc.json).

### Set the VM name and size

This example sets the VM name to "myVM" and the VM size to "Standard_A2".
```powershell
$vmName = "myVM"
$vmConfig = New-AzureRmVMConfig -VMName $vmName -VMSize "Standard_A2"
```

### Add the NIC
	
```powershell
$vm = Add-AzureRmVMNetworkInterface -VM $vmConfig -Id $nic.Id
```
	
	
### Configure the OS disk

The specialised OS could be a VHD that you [uploaded to Azure](upload-image.md) or a [copy the VHD from an existing Azure VM](vhd-copy.md). 

You can choose one of two options:
- **Option 1**: Create a specialized managed disk from a specialied VHD in an existing storage account to use as the OS disk.

or 

- **Option 2**: Use a specialized VHD stored in your own storage account (an unmanaged disk). 

#### Option 1: Create a managed disk from an unmanaged specialized disk

1. Create a managed disk from the existing specialized VHD in your storage account. This example uses **myOSDisk1** for the disk name, puts the disk in **StandardLRS** storage and uses **https://storageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/vhdcontainer/osdisk.vh.vhd** as the URI for the source VHD.

    ```powershell
    $osDisk = New-AzureRmDisk -DiskName "myOSDisk1" -Disk (New-AzureRmDiskConfig `
	-AccountType StandardLRS  -Location $location -CreateOption Import `
	-SourceUri https://storageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/vhdcontainer/osdisk.vh.vhd) `
    -ResourceGroupName $rgName
    ```

2. Add the OS disk to the configuration. This example sets the size of the disk to **128 GB** and attaches the managed disk as a **Windows** OS disk.
	
	```powershell
	$vm = Set-AzureRmVMOSDisk -VM $vm -ManagedDiskId $osDisk.Id -StorageAccountType StandardLRS `
	-DiskSizeInGB 128 -CreateOption Attach -Windows
	```

Optional: Attach additional managed disks as data disks. This option assumes that you created your managed data disks using [Create managed data disks](create-managed-disk-ps.md). 

```powershell
$vm = Add-AzureRmVMDataDisk -VM $VirtualMachine -Name $dataDiskName -CreateOption Attach -ManagedDiskId $dataDisk1.Id -Lun 1
```


#### Option 2: Attach a VHD that is in an existing storage account

1. Set the URI for the VHD that you want to use. In this example, the VHD file named **myOsDisk.vhd** is kept in a storage account named **myStorageAccount** in a container named **myContainer**.

    ```powershell
    $osDiskUri = "https://myStorageAccount.blob.core.windows.net/myContainer/myOsDisk.vhd"
    ```
2. Add the OS disk by using the URL of the copied OS VHD. In this example, when the OS disk is created, the term "osDisk" is appened to the VM name to create the OS disk name. This example also specifies that this Windows-based VHD should be attached to the VM as the OS disk.
    
	```powershell
    $osDiskName = $vmName + "osDisk"
    $vm = Set-AzureRmVMOSDisk -VM $vm -Name $osDiskName -VhdUri $osDiskUri -CreateOption attach -Windows
    ```

Optional: If you have data disks that need to be attached to the VM, add the data disks by using the URLs of data VHDs and the appropriate Logical Unit Number (Lun).

```powershell
$dataDiskName = $vmName + "dataDisk"
$vm = Add-AzureRmVMDataDisk -VM $vm -Name $dataDiskName -VhdUri $dataDiskUri -Lun 1 -CreateOption attach
```

When using a storage account, the data and operating system disk URLs look something like this: `https://StorageAccountName.blob.core.windows.net/BlobContainerName/DiskName.vhd`. You can find this on the portal by browsing to the target storage container, clicking the operating system or data VHD that was copied, and then copying the contents of the URL.


### Complete the VM 

Create the VM using the configurations that we just created.

```powershell
#Create the new VM
New-AzureRmVM -ResourceGroupName $rgName -Location $location -VM $vm
```

If this command was successful, you'll see output like this:

```powershell
RequestId IsSuccessStatusCode StatusCode ReasonPhrase
--------- ------------------- ---------- ------------
                         True         OK OK   

```

### Verify that the VM was created
You should see the newly created VM either in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), under **Browse** > **Virtual machines**, or by using the following PowerShell commands:

```powershell
$vmList = Get-AzureRmVM -ResourceGroupName $rgName
$vmList.Name
```

## Next steps
To sign in to your new virtual machine, browse to the VM in the [portal](https://portal.azure.com), click **Connect**, and open the Remote Desktop RDP file. Use the account credentials of your original virtual machine to sign in to your new virtual machine. For more information, see [How to connect and log on to an Azure virtual machine running Windows](connect-logon.md).
