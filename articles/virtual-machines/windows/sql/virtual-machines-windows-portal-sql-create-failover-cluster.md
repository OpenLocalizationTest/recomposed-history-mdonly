# Configure SQL Server Failover Cluster Instance on Azure Virtual Machines

This article explains how to create a SQL Server Failover Cluster Instance (FCI) on Azure virtual machines in Resource Manager model. In this solution, [Windows Server 2016 Datacenter edition Storage Spaces Direct \(S2D\)](http://technet.microsoft.com/windows-server-docs/storage/storage-spaces/storage-spaces-direct-overview) provides synchronized storage to each cluster node. S2D is new in Windows Server 2016.

The following diagram shows the complete solution on Azure virtual machines:

![Availability Group](./media/virtual-machines-windows-portal-sql-create-failover-cluster/00-sql-fci-s2d-complete-solution.png)

The preceding diagram shows:

- Two Azure virtual machines in a Windows Server Failover Cluster (WSFC). When a virtual machines is in a WSFC it is also called a *cluster node*, or *nodes*.
- Each virtual machine has two or more data disks.
- S2D synchronizes the data on the data disk and presents the synchronized storage as a storage pool. 
- The storage pool presents a cluster shared volume (CSV) to the WSFC.
- The SQL Server FCI cluster role uses the CSV for the data drives. 
- An Azure load balancer to hold the IP address for the SQL Server FCI.
- An Azure availability set holds all the resources.

   >[!NOTE]
   >In the complete solution, all of the items in the diagram are in the same Azure resource group.

For details about S2D, see [Windows Server 2016 Datacenter edition Storage Spaces Direct \(S2D\)](http://technet.microsoft.com/windows-server-docs/storage/storage-spaces/storage-spaces-direct-overview). 

S2D supports two types of architectures - converged and hyper-converged. The architecture in this document is hyper-converged. A hyper-converged infrastructure places the storage on the same servers that host the clustered application. In this architecture, the storage is on each SQL Server FCI node.

## Example Azure template

You can create the entire solution in Azure from a template. An example of a template is available for free in the GitHub [Azure Quickstart Templates](https://github.com/MSBrett/azure-quickstart-templates/tree/master/sql-server-2016-fci-existing-vnet-and-ad). This example is not designed or tested for any specific workload. You can evaluate the template, and modify it for your purposes. 

## Before you begin

There are a few things you need to know and a couple of things that you need in place before you proceed.

### What to know
In addition to an operational understanding of Windows cluster technologies in general and SQL Server Failover Cluster Instances specifically, you should know a little bit about:

- S2D hyper-converged solutions. See [Hyper-converged solution using Storage Spaces Direct in Windows Server 2016](http://technet.microsoft.com/windows-server-docs/storage/storage-spaces/hyper-converged-solution-using-storage-spaces-direct).
- Azure Resource groups. See [Manage Azure resources through portal](../../../azure-resource-manager/resource-group-portal.md).


### What to have

Before following the instructions in this article, you should already have:

- A Microsoft Azure subscription.
- A Windows domain on Azure virtual machines.
- An account with permission to create objects in the Azure virtual machine.
- An Azure virtual network and subnet with sufficient IP address space for the following components:
   - Both virtual machines.
   - The WSFC IP address.
   - An IP address for each FCI.
- DNS configured on the Azure Network, pointing to the domain controllers. 

With these prerequisites in place, you can proceed with building your WSFC. The first step is to create the virtual machines. 

## Step 1: Create virtual machines

1. Log in to the [Azure portal](http://portal.azure.com) with your subscription.

1. [Create an Azure availability set](../../virtual-machines-windows-create-availability-set.md).

   The availability set is a group of virtual machines that are deployed across fault domains and update domains. The availability set  makes sure that your application is not affected by single points of failure, like the network switch or the power unit of a rack of servers. 

   If you have not created the resource group for your virtual machines, do it when you create an Azure availability set. If you're using the Azure portal to create the resource group use the following settings:
   
   - Under **Create availability set**, **Resource group**, choose **Create New**.
   - Set a name for the resource group.
   - For **Location** choose the same Azure location for your virtual machines. 

1. Create the virtual machines in the availability set.

   Provision two SQL Server virtual machines in the Azure availability set. For instructions, see [Provision a SQL Server virtual machine in the Azure portal](virtual-machines-windows-portal-sql-server-provision.md). 

   Place both virtual machines:
   
   - In the same Azure resource group that your availability set is in. 
   - On the same network as your domain controller.
   - On a subnet with sufficient IP address space for both virtual machines, and all FCIs that you will include on this cluster. 
   - In the Azure availability set.   
  
      >[!IMPORTANT]
      >You cannot set or change availability set after a virtual machine has been created.

   Choose an image from the Azure Marketplace. You can use a Marketplace image with that includes Windows Server and SQL Server, or just the Windows Server. For details, see [Overview of SQL Server on Azure Virtual Machines](../../virtual-machines-windows-sql-server-iaas-overview.md)
   

   The official SQL Server images in the Azure Gallery include an installed SQL Server instance, plus the SQL Server installation software, and the required key. 
   
   Choose the right image according to how you want to pay for the SQL Server license: 

   - **Pay per usage licensing**: The per-minute cost of these images includes the SQL Server licensing:
      - **SQL Server 2016 Enterprise on Windows Server Datacenter 2016**
      - **SQL Server 2016 Standard on Windows Server Datacenter 2016**
      - **SQL Server 2016 Developer on Windows Server Datacenter 2016**
   
   - **Bring-your-own-license (BYOL)**
   
      - **{BYOL} SQL Server 2016 Enterprise on Windows Server Datacenter 2016**
      - **{BYOL} SQL Server 2016 Standard on Windows Server Datacenter 2016** 

   
   >[!IMPORTANT]
   >After you create the virtual machine, remove the SQL Server instance. You will use the pre-installed media to create the SQL Server FCI after you configure the WSFC and S2D. 

   Alternatively, you can use Azure Marketplace images with just the operating system. Choose a **Windows Server 2016 Datacenter** image and install the SQL Server FCI after you configure the WSFC and S2D. This image does not contain SQL Server installation media. Place the installation media in a location where you can run the SQL Server installation for each server. 

1. After azure creates your virtual machines, connect to each virtual machine with RDP. 

   When you first connect to a virtual machine with RDP, the computer will ask if you want to allow this PC to be discoverable on the network. Click **Yes**. 

1. If you are using one of the SQL Server-based virtual machine images, remove the SQL Server instance.

   - In **Programs and Features** right-click **Microsoft SQL Server 2016 (64-bit)** and click **Uninstall/Change**. 
   - Click **Remove**. 
   - Select the default instance.
   - Remove all features under **MSSQLSERVER**. Do not remove **Shared Features**. See the following picture:

      ![Remove Features](./media/virtual-machines-windows-portal-sql-create-failover-cluster/03-remove-features.png)

   - Click **Next**, and then click **Remove**.

1. Open the firewall ports.
   
   On each virtual machine, open the following ports on the Windows Firewall. 

   On each virtual machine, open the following ports:

   | Purpose | TCP Port | Notes
   | ------ | ------ | ------
   | SQL Server | 1433 | Normal port for default instances of SQL Server. If you used an image from the gallery, this port is automatically opened. 
   | Health probe | 59999 | Any open TCP port. In a later step, configure the load balancer health probe and the cluster to use this port.  

1. Add storage to the virtual machine. [Add storage](../../../storage/storage-premium-storage.md#quick-start-create-and-use-a-premium-storage-account-for-a-virtual-machine-data-disk).

   Both virtual machines need at least two data disks.

   Attach raw disks - not NTFS formatted disks. 
      >[!NOTE]
      >If you attach NTFS-formatted disks, you can only enable S2D with no disk eligibility check.  
   
   Attach a minimum of two Premium Storage (SSD disks) to each VM. We recommend at least P30 (1 TB) disks.

   Set host caching to **Read-only**.

   The storage capacity you use in production environments depends on your workload. The values described in this article are for demonstration and testing. 

1. [Add the virtual machines to your pre-existing domain](virtual-machines-windows-portal-sql-availability-group-prereq.md#joinDomain).

After the virtual machines are created and configured, you can configure the WSFC.

## Step 2: Configure WSFC with S2D

The next step is to configure the WSFC with S2D. In this step you will validate and configure the cluster, and then add storage. 

1. To begin, connnect to the first virtual machine with RDP using a domain account that is a member of local administrators, and has permissions to create objects in Active Directory. Use this account for the rest of the configuration.

1. [Add Failover Clustering feature to each virtual machine](virtual-machines-windows-portal-sql-availability-group-prereq.md#add-failover-cluster-features-to-both-sql-servers).

   To install Failover Clustering feature from the UI, do the following steps on both virtual machines. 
   - In **Server Manager**, click **Manage**, and then click **Add Roles and Features**. 
   - In **Add Roles and Features Wizard**, click **Next** until you get to **Select Features**.
   - In **Select Features**, click **Failover Clustering**. Include all required features and the management tools. Click **Add Features**.
   - Click **Next** and then click **Finish** to install the features. 


   The next steps follow the instructions under Step 3 of [Hyper-converged solution using Storage Spaces Direct in Windows Server 2016](http://technet.microsoft.com/windows-server-docs/storage/storage-spaces/hyper-converged-solution-using-storage-spaces-direct#step-3-configure-storage-spaces-direct). 

1. [Validate cluster](http://technet.microsoft.com/windows-server-docs/storage/storage-spaces/hyper-converged-solution-using-storage-spaces-direct#step-31-run-cluster-validation).

   To validate the cluster with the UI, do the following steps from one of the virtual machines. 
   - In **Server Manager**, click **Tools**, then click **Failover Cluster Manager**. 
   - In **Failover Cluster Manager**, click **Action**, then click **Validate Configuration...**.
   - Click **Next**. 
   - On **Select Servers or a Cluster** type the name of both virtual machines.

1. [Create the WSFC](http://technet.microsoft.com/windows-server-docs/storage/storage-spaces/hyper-converged-solution-using-storage-spaces-direct#step-32-create-a-cluster).

   To create the WSFC in the UI, see [the create cluster step of the Always On Availability Group tutorial](virtual-machines-windows-portal-sql-availability-group-tutorial.md#CreateCluster).

   Alternatively, the following PowerShell creates a WSFC. 

   ```PowerShell
   New-Cluster -Name <clustername> -Node $nodes –StaticAddress <192.254.0.1> -NoStorage
   ```
   
   For details, refer to [Create a cluster].

   >[!TIP]
   >Use a link-local address for the cluster static address. For example, <192.254.0.1>. This address cannot be used anywhere else within the subnet. 
   
1. [Create a cloud witness for the WSFC](http://technet.microsoft.com/windows-server-docs/failover-clustering/deploy-cloud-witness). 

   Create the cloud witness in the same resource group as the Azure virtual machines. 
   
1. [Clean disks](http://technet.microsoft.com/windows-server-docs/storage/storage-spaces/hyper-converged-solution-using-storage-spaces-direct#step-34-clean-disks).
   
   The disks for S2D need to be empty and without partitions or other data. Follow the instructions in the preceding link to verify that the disks are clean.
   
1. [Enable Store Spaces Direct \(S2D\)](http://technet.microsoft.com/windows-server-docs/storage/storage-spaces/hyper-converged-solution-using-storage-spaces-direct#step-35-enable-storage-spaces-direct).

   The following PowerShell enables storage spaces direct.  

   ```PowerShell
   Enable-ClusterS2D
   ```

1. [Create a volume](http://technet.microsoft.com/windows-server-docs/storage/storage-spaces/hyper-converged-solution-using-storage-spaces-direct#step-36-create-volumes).

   One of the features of S2D is that it automatically creates a storage pool when you enable it. You are now ready to create a volume. The PowerShell commandlet `New-Volume` automates the volume creation process, including formatting, adding to the cluster, and creating a cluster shared volume (CSV). The following example creates an 800 gigabyte (GB) CSV. 

   ```PowerShell
   New-Volume -StoragePoolFriendlyName S2D* -FriendlyName VDisk01 -FileSystem CSVFS_REFS -Size 800GB
   ```   

## Create SQL Server FCI

After you have configured the WSFC and all cluster components including storage, you can create the SQL Server FCI. 

1. Connect to the first virtual machine with RDP. 

1. In **Failover Cluster Manager**, make sure all cluster core resources are on the first virtual machine. If necessary, move all resources to this virtual machine. 

1. Locate the installation media. If the virtual machine uses one of the Azure Marketplace images, the media is located at `C:\SQLServer_<version number>_Full`. Click **Setup**.

1. In the **SQL Server Installation Center**, click **Installation**.

1. Click **New SQL Server Failover Cluster Installation**. Follow the instructions in the wizard to install the SQL Server FCI. 

1. After you create the SQL Server FCI on the first node, connect to the second node with RDP.

1. Open the **SQL Server Installation Center**. Click **Installation**.

1. Click **Add node to a SQL Server failover cluster**. Follow the instructions in the wizard to install SQL server and add this server to the FCI.

   >[!NOTE]
   >If you used an Azure Marketplace gallery image with SQL Server, SQL Server tools were included with the image. If you did not use this image, install the SQL Server tools separately. See [Download SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt238290.aspx).

## Configure Azure load balancer

The Azure load balancer holds the IP address for the SQL Server FCI. 

[Create and configure an Azure load balancer](virtual-machines-windows-portal-sql-availability-group-tutorial.md#configure-internal-load-balancer).

   This load balancer must:
   
   - Be in the same network and subnet as the cluster nodes.
   - Have a static IP address for the SQL Server Virtual IP.
      
      >[!TIP]
      >You can create the load balancer with a dynamic IP address and then change it to a static address after it is created. 

   - Include a backend pool consisting of the virtual machines.
   - Use the TCP port probe specific to the IP address.
   - Configure load balancer with direct server return (floating IP).

   >[!NOTE]
   >On Azure virtual machines, clusters use a load balancer to hold an IP address that needs to be on one cluster node at a time.

The load balancer for an FCI requires a floating IP address with direct server return.  

## Configure cluster probe

Set the cluster probe port parameter in PowerShell.

To set the cluster probe port parameter, update variables in the following script from your environment. 

   ```PowerShell
   $ClusterNetworkName = "<Cluster Network Name>" # the cluster network name (Use Get-ClusterNetwork on Windows Server 2012 of higher to find the name)
   $IPResourceName = "IP Address Resource Name" # the IP Address resource name
   $ILBIP = "<10.0.0.x>" # the IP Address of the Internal Load Balancer (ILB). This is the static IP address for the load balancer you configured in the Azure portal.
   [int]$ProbePort = 59999
   
   Import-Module FailoverClusters

   Get-ClusterResource $IPResourceName | Set-ClusterParameter -Multiple @{"Address"="$ILBIP";"ProbePort"=$ProbePort;"SubnetMask"="255.255.255.255";"Network"="$ClusterNetworkName";"EnableDhcp"=0}
   ```

## Test failover

Test failover of the FCI to validate cluster functionality. Do the following steps:

1. Connect to one of the SQL Server FCI cluster nodes with RDP.

1. Open **Failover Cluster Manager**. Click **Roles**. Notice which node owns the SQL Server FCI role. 

1. Right-click the SQL Server FCI role. 

1. Click **Move** and click **Best Possible Node**.

**Failover Cluster Manager** shows the role and its resources go offline. The resources then move and come online on the other node. 

## Test connectivity

To test connectivity, log in to another virtual machine in the same virtual network. Open SQL Server management studio and connect to the SQL Server FCI name. 

## Limitations
DTC is not supported on FCIs because the RPC port is not supported by the load balancer.
