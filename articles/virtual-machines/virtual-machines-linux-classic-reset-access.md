# How to reset access and manage users and check disks with the Azure VMAccess extension for Linux


If you can't connect to a Linux virtual machine on Azure because of a forgotten password, an incorrect Secure Shell (SSH) key, or a problem with the SSH configuration, use the VMAccessForLinux extension with the Azure CLI to reset the password or SSH key, fix the SSH configuration, and check disk consistency. 

[AZURE.INCLUDE [learn-about-deployment-models](../../includes/learn-about-deployment-models-classic-include.md)] [Resource Manager model](https://github.com/Azure/azure-linux-extensions/tree/master/VMAccess).




## Azure CLI

You will need the following:

- Microsoft Azure Linux agent version 2.0.5 or later. Most Linux images in the Azure Marketplace include at least version 2.0.5. To find out which version is installed, run **waagent -version**. To update the agent, follow the instructions in the [Azure Linux Agent User Guide](virtual-machines-linux-agent-user-guide.md).
- Azure Command-Line Interface (CLI). You will need to [install the Azure CLI](../xplat-cli-install.md)) and [connect to your subscription](../xplat-cli-connect.md)) to use Azure resources associated with your account.
- A new password or set of SSH keys, if you want to reset either one. You don't need these if you want to reset the SSH configuration.


## Use the azure vm extension set command

With the Azure CLI, you use the **azure vm extension set** command from your command-line interface (Bash, Terminal, Command prompt) to access commands. Run **azure help vm extension set** for detailed extension usage.

With the Azure CLI, you can do the following tasks:

+ [Reset the password](#pwresetcli)
+ [Reset the SSH key](#sshkeyresetcli)
+ [Reset the password and the SSH key](#resetbothcli)
+ [Create a new sudo user account](#createnewsudocli)
+ [Reset the SSH configuration](#sshconfigresetcli)
+ [Delete a user](#deletecli)
+ [Display the status of the VMAccess extension](#statuscli)
+ [Check consistency of added disks](#checkdisk)
+ [Repair added disks on your Linux VM](#repairdisk)

### <a name="pwresetcli"></a>Reset the password

Step 1: Create a file named PrivateConf.json with these contents, substituting for the placeholder values.

	{
	"username":"currentusername",
	"password":"newpassword",
	"expiration":"2016-01-01"
	}

Step 2: Run this command, substituting the name of your virtual machine for "vmname".

	azure vm extension set vmname VMAccessForLinux Microsoft.OSTCExtensions 1.* –-private-config-path PrivateConf.json

### <a name="sshkeyresetcli"></a>Reset the SSH key

Step 1: Create a file named PrivateConf.json with these contents, substituting for the placeholder values.

	{
	"username":"currentusername",
	"ssh_key":"contentofsshkey"
	}

Step 2: Run this command, substituting the name of your virtual machine for "vmname".

	azure vm extension set vmname VMAccessForLinux Microsoft.OSTCExtensions 1.* --private-config-path PrivateConf.json

### <a name="resetbothcli"></a>Reset the password and the SSH key

Step 1: Create a file named PrivateConf.json with these contents, substituting for the placeholder values.

	{
	"username":"currentusername",
	"ssh_key":"contentofsshkey",
	"password":"newpassword"
	}

Step 2: Run this command, substituting the name of your virtual machine for "vmname".

	azure vm extension set vmname VMAccessForLinux Microsoft.OSTCExtensions 1.* --private-config-path PrivateConf.json

### <a name="createnewsudocli"></a>Create a new sudo user account

If you forget your user name, you can use VMAccess to create a new one with the sudo authority. In this case, the existing user name and password will not be modified.

To create a new sudo user with password access, use the script in [Reset the password](#pwresetcli) and specify the new user name.

To create a new sudo user with SSH key access, use the script in [Reset the SSH key](#sshkeyresetcli) and specify the new user name.

You can also use [Reset the password and the SSH key](#resetbothcli) to create a new user with both password and SSH key access.

### <a name="sshconfigresetcli"></a>Reset the SSH configuration

If the SSH configuration is in an undesired state, you might also lose access to the VM. You can use the VMAccess extension to reset the configuration to its default state. To do so, you just need to set the “reset_ssh” key to “True”. The extension will restart the SSH server, open the SSH port on your VM, and reset the SSH configuration to default values. The user account (name, password or SSH keys) will not be changed.

> [AZURE.NOTE] The SSH configuration file that gets reset is located at /etc/ssh/sshd_config.

Step 1: Create a file named PrivateConf.json with this content.

	{
	"reset_ssh":"True"
	}

Step 2: Run this command, substituting the name of your virtual machine for "vmname".

	azure vm extension set vmname VMAccessForLinux Microsoft.OSTCExtensions 1.* --private-config-path PrivateConf.json

### <a name="deletecli"></a>Delete a user

If you want to delete a user account without logging into to the VM directly, you can use this script.

Step 1: Create a file named PrivateConf.json with this content, substituting for the placeholder value.

	{
	"remove_user":"usernametoremove"
	}

Step 2: Run this command, substituting the name of your virtual machine for "vmname".

	azure vm extension set vmname VMAccessForLinux Microsoft.OSTCExtensions 1.* --private-config-path PrivateConf.json

### <a name="statuscli"></a>Display the status of the VMAccess extension

To display the status of the VMAccess extension, run this command.

	azure vm extension get

### <a name='checkdisk'<</a>Check consistency of added disks

To run fsck on all disks in your Linux virtual machine, you will need to do the following:

Step 1: Create a file named PublicConf.json with this content. Check Disk takes a boolean for whether to check disks attached to your virtual machine or not. 

    {   
    "check_disk": "true"
    }

Step 2: Run this command to execute, substituting for the placeholder values.

   azure vm extension set vm-name VMAccessForLinux Microsoft.OSTCExtensions 1.* --public-config-path PublicConf.json 

### <a name='repairdisk'></a>Repair added disks on your Linux virtual machine

To repair disks that are not mounting or have mount configuration errors, use the VMAccess extension to reset the mount configuration on your Linux VIrtual machine.

Step 1: Create a file named PublicConf.json with this content. 

    {
    "repair_disk":"true",
    "disk_name":"yourdisk"
    }

Step 2: Run this command to execute, substituting for the placeholder values.

    azure vm extension set vm-name VMAccessForLinux Microsoft.OSTCExtensions 1.* --public-config-path PublicConf.json



## Additional resources

* If you want to use Azure PowerShell cmdlets or Azure Resource Manager templates to reset the password or SSH key, fix the SSH configuration, and check disk consistency, see the [VMAccess extension documentation on GitHub](https://github.com/Azure/azure-linux-extensions/tree/master/VMAccess). 

* You can also use the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) to reset the password or SSH key of a Linux VM deployed in the classic deployment model. You can't currently use the portal do to this for a Linux VM deployed in the Resource Manager deployment model.

* See [About virtual machine extensions and features](virtual-machines-linux-extensions-features.md) for more about using VM extensions for Azure virtual machines.
