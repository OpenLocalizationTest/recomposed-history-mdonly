## Issue: Custom/gallery/marketplace image; allocation failure
This error arises in situations when the new VM request is sent to a cluster that either does not have available free space to accommodate the request, or cannot support the VM size being requested. It is not possible to mix different series of VMs in the same cloud service. So if you want to create a new VM of a different size than what your cloud service can support, the compute request will fail.

Depending on the constraints of the cloud service you use to create the new VM, you might encounter an error caused by one of two situations.

**Cause 1:** The cloud service is pinned to a specific cluster, or it is linked to an affinity group, and hence pinned to a specific cluster by design. So new compute resource requests in that affinity group are tried in the same cluster where the existing resources are hosted. However, the same cluster may either not support the requested VM size or have insufficient available space, resulting in an allocation error. This is true whether the new resources are created through a new cloud service or through an existing cloud service.

**Resolution 1:**

- Create a new cloud service and associate it with either a region or a region-based virtual network.
- Create a new VM in the new cloud service.
  If you get an error when trying to create a new cloud service, either retry at a later time or change the region for the cloud service.

> [AZURE.IMPORTANT] If you were trying to create a new VM in an existing cloud service but couldn’t, and had to create a new cloud service for your new VM, you can choose to consolidate all your VMs in the same cloud service. To do so, delete the VMs in the existing cloud service, and recapture them from their disks in the new cloud service. However, it is important to remember that the new cloud service will have a new name and VIP, so you will need to update these for all the dependencies that currently use this information for the existing cloud service.

**Cause 2:** The cloud service is associated with a virtual network that is linked to an affinity group, so it is pinned to a specific cluster by design. All new compute resource requests in that affinity group are therefore tried in the same cluster where the existing resources are hosted. However, the same cluster may either not support the requested VM size or have insufficient available space, resulting in an allocation error. This is true whether the new resources are created through a new cloud service or through an existing cloud service.

**Resolution 2:**

- Create a new regional virtual network.
- Create the new VM in the new virtual network.
- [Connect your existing virtual network](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/vnet-to-vnet-connecting-virtual-networks-in-azure-across-different-regions/) to the new virtual network. See more about [regional virtual networks](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/2014/05/14/regional-virtual-networks/). Alternatively, you can [migrate your affinity-group-based virtual network to a regional virtual network](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/2014/11/26/migrating-existing-services-to-regional-scope/), and then create the new VM.
