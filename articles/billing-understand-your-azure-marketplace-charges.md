# Understand your Azure External Service Charges

This article explains the billing of External Services in Azure. They are sometimes called Marketplace Orders. External Services are provided by independent service vendors, but are integrated completely within the Azure ecosystem. In this article you'll learn how to:

- Identify External Services
- Understand how the billing differs from other Azure resources
- View and track any costs you accrue from the use of external services
- Manage external service orders and how you pay for them

## Important traits of external services

### Identifying External services

When you provision a new resource, you'll see the following warning when the resource is an external service order:

Remove next line?

In most cases these will be services published by companies that are not Microsoft. Certain Microsoft products are also leveraging the Azure Marketplace through the same channel and will also be categorized as External Services.

### External services are billed separately

External services are treated as individual orders within your Azure subscription. The billing period for each service is set when you purchase the service. Not to be confused with the billing period of the subscription under which you purchased it. You will also receive separate bills and your credit card will be charged separately.

### Payment models

You need a credit card to buy External services. You will not be able to buy them if your subscription uses Invoice pay. Some services are billed in a pay-as-you-go fashion while others use a monthly base payment model.

### Azure Free Credits and External services

If you are using an azure subscription that includes [free credit](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/spending-limits/), you should be aware that this credit can't be applied to external service bills, this means that you must have a credit card associated with your subscription to purchase them, and this is the card that will be charged.

## Viewing your External Service Spending and History

You can view a list of the external services that are on each subscription within the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/): 

1. Navigate to the Billing blade

2. Select a subscription

3. Use the External Services command and you'll see each one of your external service orders, the publisher name, service tier you bought, name you gave the resource, and the current order status.

From here you can view past bill amounts including the tax breakdown.

## How to Manage your Orders and Payments
The summary page in the [Azure Account Center](https://account.windowsazure.com/) has user actions, allowing you to update your payment instrument:
