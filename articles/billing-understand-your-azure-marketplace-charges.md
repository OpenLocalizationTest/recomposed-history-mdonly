# Understand your Azure External Service Charges

This article explains the billing of external services in Azure. External services used to be called Marketplace orders. External Services are provided by independent service vendors, but are integrated completely within the Azure ecosystem. Learn how to:

- Identify External Services
- Understand how the billing differs from other Azure resources
- View and track any costs you accrue from the use of external services
- Manage external service orders and how you pay for them

## What are Azure external services?

### Identifying external services

When you provision a new resource, the following warning appears when the resource is an external service order:

Usually external services are published by companies that are not Microsoft, but sometimes Microsoft products are also categorized as external services.

### External services are billed separately

External services are treated as individual orders within your Azure subscription. The billing period for each service is set when you purchase the service. Not to be confused with the billing period of the subscription under which you purchased it. You also receive separate bills and your credit card is charged separately.

### Payment models

You need a credit card to buy External services. If your subscription uses Invoice pay, you are not able to buy them. Some services are billed in a pay-as-you-go fashion while others use a monthly base payment model.

### Azure free credit and external services

If you are using an azure subscription that includes [free credit](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/spending-limits/), this credit can't be applied to external service bills. You must have a credit card associated with your subscription to purchase external services, and this is the card that is charged.

## Viewing your external service spending and history

You can view a list of the external services that are on each subscription within the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/): 

1. Navigate to the Billing blade
   
  

2. Select a subscription

3. Use the External Services command to view each of your external service orders, the publisher name, service tier you bought, name you gave the resource, and the current order status.
