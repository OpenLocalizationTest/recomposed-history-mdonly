#Developing a predictive solution with Azure Machine Learning
 
Suppose you need to predict an individual’s credit risk based on the information they give on a credit application.  

That’s a complex problem, of course, but let’s simplify the parameters of the question a bit and use it as an example of how you might be able to use Microsoft Azure Machine Learning with ML Studio and ML API service to create such a predictive analytics solution.  

In this walkthrough, we’ll follow the process of developing a predictive analytics model in ML Studio and then publishing it to the ML API service. We’ll start with publicly-available credit risk data, develop and train a predictive model based on that data, and then publish the model as a web service that can be used by others.  

We’ll follow these steps:  

1.	[Create an ML workspace](machine-learning-1-create-ml-workspace)
2.	[Upload existing data](machine-learning-2-upload-data)
3.	[Create a new experiment](machine-learning-3-create-new-experiment)
4.	[Train and evaluate the models](machine-learning-4-train-and-evaluate-models)
5.	[Publish the web service](machine-learning-5-publish-web-service)
6.	[Access the web service](machine-learning-6-access-web-service)

This walkthrough is based on a simplified version of the 
[Credit risk prediction sample](machine-learning-credit-risk-prediction-sample-experiment) experiment included with ML Studio.
