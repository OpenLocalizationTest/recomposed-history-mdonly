This topic is no longer supported; a standalone Windows Store project is no longer available for download from the portal. You can instead download a universal Windows project. For more information, see [Get started with Mobile Services](/en-us/documentation/articles/mobile-services-javascript-backend-windows-store-dotnet-get-started/).
