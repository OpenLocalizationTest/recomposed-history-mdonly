# Diagnostic search in Application Insights

One of the most traditional debugging methods is to insert lines of code that emit a trace log. [Application Insights][start] can capture your web server logs and help you search and filter them. You can write your log code using log4Net, NLog or System.Diagnostics.Trace. There's also a simple TrackTrace method in the Application Insights SDK.

Your search results can also include the regular page view and request events that are used to build the usage and performance reports, together with any custom TrackEvent calls that you have written [to track usage][usage].

## <a name="capture"></a> Capture log events

You have to install an adapter in your project, in order to search logs generated with log4Net, NLog, or System.Diagnostics.Trace. 

(Alternatively, there's a simple tracing call, TrackTrace(String), built into the Application Insights SDK. It doesn't need an adapter, so if that's all you need, you can [skip this step](#deploy).)

1. If you plan to use log4Net or NLog, install it in your project. 
2. If you haven't yet [installed Application Insights in your project][start], do that now.
2. In Solution Explorer, right-click your project and choose **Manage NuGet Packages**.
3. Select Online > All, select **Include Prerelease** and search for "Microsoft.ApplicationInsights"

    ![Get the prerelease version of the appropriate adapter](./media/appinsights/appinsights-36nuget.png)


4. Select the appropriate package - one of:
  + Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.TraceListener (to capture System.Diagnostics.Trace calls)
  + Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.NLogTarget
  + Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Log4NetAppender

The NuGet package installs the necessary assemblies, and also modifies web.config or app.config.

## <a name="pepper"></a>3. Insert diagnostic log calls

Insert event logging calls using your chosen logging framework. 

For example, if you use the simple Application Insights SDK, you might insert:

    var tc = new Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.TelemetryContext();
    tc.TrackTrace("Slow response - database01");

Or if you use System.Diagnostics.Trace:

    System.Diagnostics.Trace.TraceWarning("Slow response - database01");

If you prefer log4net or NLog:

    logger.Warn("Slow response - database01");

Run your app in debug mode, or deploy it to your web server.

## <a name="view"></a>4. View log data


1. In Application Insights, open diagnostic search.

    ![Open diagnostic search](./media/appinsights/appinsights-30openDiagnostics.png)
   
2. Set the filter for the event types you'd like to see.

    ![Open diagnostic search](./media/appinsights/appinsights-331filterTrace.png)


The event types are:

* **Trace** - Search diagnostic logs that you've captured from your web server. This includes log4Net, NLog, System.Diagnostic.Trace, and ApplicationInsights TrackTrace calls.
* **Request** - Search HTTP requests received by the server component of your web app, including page requests, data requests, images, and so on. The events you'll see are the telemetry sent by the Application Insights server SDK, which are used to create the request count report.
* **Page View** - Search page view events. These events are sent by the web client and are used to create page view reports. (If you don't see anything here, set up [web client monitoring][webclient].)
* **Custom Event** - If you inserted calls to TrackEvent() and TrackMetric() to [monitor usage][usage], you can search them here.

Select any log event to see its detail. 

![Open diagnostic search](./media/appinsights/appinsights-32detail.png)

You can use plain strings (without wildcards) to filter the field data within an item.

The available fields depend on the logging framework and the parameters you used in the call.


## <a name="search"></a>5. Search the data

Set a time range and search for terms. Searches over a shorter range are faster. 

![Open diagnostic search](./media/appinsights/appinsights-311search.png)

Notice that you search for terms, not substrings. Terms are alphanumeric strings including some punctuation such as '.' and '_'. For example:

<table>
  <tr><th>term</th><th>is NOT matched by</th><th>but these do match</th></tr>
  <tr><td>HomeController.About</td><td>about<br/>home</td><td>h*about<br/>home*</td></tr>
  <tr><td>IsLocal</td><td>local<br/>is<br/>*local</td><td>isl*<br/>islocal<br/>i*l</td></tr>
  <tr><td>New Delay</td><td>w d</td><td>new<br/>delay<br/>n* AND d*</td></tr>
</table>

Here are the search expressions you can use:

<table>
                    <tr>
                      <th>
                        <p>Sample query</p>
                      </th>
                      <th>
                        <p>Effect</p>
                      </th>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                      <td>
                        <p>
                          <span class="code">slow</span>
                        </p>
                      </td>
                      <td>
                        <p>Find all events in the date range whose fields include the term "slow"</p>
                      </td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                      <td>
                        <p>
                          <span class="code">database??</span>
                        </p>
                      </td>
                      <td>
                        <p>Matches database01, databaseAB, ...</p>
                        <p>? is not allowed at the start of a search term.</p>
                      </td>
                    </tr>
                     <tr>
                      <td>

                        </p>
                      </td>
                      <td>
                        <p>Matches database, database01, databaseNNNN</p>

                        <p>Find events that contain both terms. Use capital "AND", not "and".</p>
                      </td>
                    </tr>

## <a name="questions"></a>Q & A

### <a name="emptykey"></a>I get an error "Instrumentation key cannot be empty"

Looks like you installed the logging adapter Nuget package without installing Application Insights.

In Solution Explorer, right-click `ApplicationInsights.config` and choose **Update Application Insights**. You'll get a dialog that invites you to sign in to Azure and either create an Application Insights resource, or re-use an existing one. That should fix it.

### <a name="limits"></a>How much data is retained?

Up to 500 events per second from each application. Events are retained for seven days.
