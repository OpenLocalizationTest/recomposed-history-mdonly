# Perform job preparation and completion maintenance in Azure Batch

Azure Batch jobs often require some form of set up prior to execution, and similarly, some sort of clean up after the job's tasks have completed. Batch provides the mechanisms for this preparation and cleanup in the form of *job preparation* and *job release* tasks.

Before executing of any of a job's tasks, the job preparation task is run all compute nodes scheduled to run tasks. Once the job has completed, the job release task is run on each of the nodes within the pool that executed at least one task. Both job preparation and release tasks allow for the specification of a command line to be executed when invoked, and they retain many of the standard task capabilities such as file download and elevated execution, and properties such as custom environment variables and maximum execution duration, retry count, and file retention time.

In the following sections, you'll find out how to use these two special task types using [JobReleaseTask][net_job_prep] and [JobReleaseTask][net_job_release] found within the [Batch .NET][api_net] API.

> [AZURE.TIP] Job preparation and release tasks are especially helpful in "shared pool" environments--those environments in which a pool of compute nodes persists between job runs and is shared between many different jobs.

## When to use job preparation and release tasks

A number of situations can benefit from job preparation and release tasks, here are just a few.

- **Transfer of common task data** - Batch jobs often require a common set of data as input for the job's tasks. For example, when performing daily risk analysis, market data is job-specific, yet common to all of the tasks in the job. This market data, often several gigabytes in size, should be downloaded to each compute node only once, then shared by each task executed on a node. Employing a *job preparation task* allows for the download of such data to each node prior to the execution of any tasks.
- **Job data deletion** - Within a shared pool environment in which a pool's compute nodes are not decommissioned between jobs, deleting job data between runs is necessary to prevent the pool's compute nodes from running out of disk space. It may also be done to satisfy an organization's security policy requiring minimal retention time of sensitive data. The *job release task* provides this capability, allowing for the deletion of data downloaded by a job preparation task or generated during task execution.
- **Log retention** - It is sometimes desirable to keep a copy of log files generated by tasks, or perhaps crash dump files generated by failed applications. A *job release task* could be used in such cases to compress and upload this data to an Azure Storage account.

## Job preparation tasks

Prior to the execution of a job's tasks, the job preparation task is executed on each compute node scheduled to run a task. By default, the Batch service will wait for the successful completion of the job preparation task prior to scheduling any tasks on the node, but may be configured not to wait. The job preparation task will be rerun on a compute node if the node is restarted, but this behavior may also be disabled.

The job preparation task is only executed on nodes scheduled to run a task. This prevents the unnecessary execution of a preparation task should a node not be assigned a task, providing savings in data transfer charges, for example. This situation applies when the number of tasks for a job is less than the number of nodes in a pool, or when [concurrent task execution](batch-parallel-node-tasks.md) is enabled, leaving some nodes idle if the task count is lower than the total possible concurrent tasks.

> [AZURE.NOTE] The [JobPreparationTask][net_job_prep_cloudjob] task differs from the [CloudPool.StartTask][pool_starttask] in that the JobPreparationTask executes at the start of each job, whereas the StartTask executes only when a compute node first joins a pool or is restarted.

## Job release tasks

Once a job has completed, the job release task will be executed on each node in the pool that executed at least one task. A job is marked as completed by issuing a terminate request, and when terminated, the Batch service sets the job to the *terminating* state. The service then terminates any active or running tasks associated with the job, then runs the job release task. The job then moves into the *completed* state.

> [AZURE.NOTE] Job deletion also executes the job release task. However, if a job was previously terminated, the release task is not run a second time when the same job is subsequently deleted.

## Job preparation and release in Batch .NET

Specifying a job preparation task is done by creating and configuring a [JobPreparationTask][net_job_prep] and assigning it to your job's [CloudJob.JobPreparationTask][net_job_prep_cloudjob] property. Similarly, initialize a [JobReleaseTask][net_job_release] and assign it to your job's [CloudJob.JobReleaseTask][net_job_prep_cloudjob] property to set the job's release task.

In this code snippet, `myBatchClient` is a fully initialized instance of [BatchClient][net_batch_client], and `myPool` is an existing pool within the Batch account.

		// Create the CloudJob for CloudPool "myPool"
		CloudJob myJob = myBatchClient.JobOperations.CreateJob(jobId, new PoolInformation() { PoolId = "myPool" });

		// Configure and assign the job preparation task
		JobPreparationTask prepTask = new JobPreparationTask();
		prepTask.CommandLine = "cmd /c echo %AZ_BATCH_NODE_ID% > %AZ_BATCH_NODE_SHARED_DIR%\\job_prep_and_release.txt";
		myJob.JobPreparationTask = prepTask;

		// Configure and assign the job release task
		JobReleaseTask releaseTask = new JobReleaseTask();
		releaseTask.CommandLine = "cmd /c del %AZ_BATCH_NODE_SHARED_DIR%\\job_prep_and_release.txt";
		myJob.JobReleaseTask = releaseTask;

		await myJob.CommitAsync();

As mentioned above, the release task is executed when a job is terminated or deleted. Terminating a job with the Batch .NET API is performed by calling [PoolOperations.TerminateJobAsync][net_job_terminate], and job deletion is performed with [PoolOperations.DeleteJobAsync][net_job_delete], both of which are typically done when all of a job's tasks have completed or a timeout you have defined has been reached.

		// Terminate the job to mark it as Completed; this will initiate the Job Release Task on any node
		// that executed job tasks. Note that the Job Release Task is also executed when a job is deleted,
		// thus you need not call Terminate if you typically delete your jobs upon task completion.
		await myBatchClient.JobOperations.TerminateJobAsync(job.Id);

### Sample project on GitHub

Check out the [JobPrepRelease][job_prep_release_sample] sample project on GitHub to see job preparation and release tasks in action. This console application:

1. Creates a pool with two "small" nodes
2. Creates a job with with job preparation, release, and standard tasks
3. The job preparation task first writes the node ID to a text file in a node's "shared" directory
4. Each task that runs on a node then writes its ID to the same text file
5. Once all tasks have completed (or the timeout is reached), the contents of each node's text file are printed to the console
6. When the job is complete, the job release task deletes the file from the node
6. The exit codes of the job prep and release tasks are then printed for each node on which they executed
7. Execution pauses to allow confirmation of job and/or pool deletion

Output from the sample application is similar to the following:

		Attempting to create pool: poolPrepRelease
		The pool already existed when we tried to create it
		Checking for existing job jobPrepRelease...
		Job jobPrepRelease not found, creating...
		Submitting tasks and awaiting completion...
		All tasks completed.

### Inspect job preparation and release tasks with Batch Explorer

The [Batch Explorer][batch_explorer_article], also found in the Batch [sample code repository][batch_explorer_project] on Github, is an excellent tool for use when developing solutions with Azure Batch. When running the above sample application, you can use the Batch Explorer to inspect the properties of the job, its tasks, and even download and view the shared text file modified by the job tasks.

The screenshot below highlights the job preparation and release task properties shown in the Job Details pane when the *jobPrepRelease* job is selected in the Jobs tab.
