# Running jobs on Azure Batch with Azure CLI

This script creates a Batch job and adds a series of tasks to the job. It also demonstrates
how to monitor a job and its tasks.
Running this script assumes that a Batch account has already been set up, and both a pool and
an application have been configured. For more information, please see the [sample scripts](../batch-cli-samples.md) covering
each of these topics.

If needed, install the Azure CLI using the instructions found in the [Azure CLI installation guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli), 
and then run `az login` to log into Azure.

## Sample script

[!code-azurecli[main](../../../cli_scripts/batch/run-job/run-job.sh "Run Job")]

## Clean up job

After you run the above sample script, run the following command to remove the
job and all of its tasks. Note that the pool will need to be deleted separately; please see
the [tutorial on managing pools](./batch-cli-sample-manage-pool.md).

```azurecli
az batch job delete --job-id myjob
```

## Script explanation

This script uses the following commands to create a Batch job and tasks. Each command in the table links to command-specific documentation.
