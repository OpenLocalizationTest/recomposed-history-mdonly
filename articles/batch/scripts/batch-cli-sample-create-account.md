# Create a Batch Account with the Azure CLI

This script creates an Azure Batch Account and shows how various properties of the account 
can be queried and updated.
A Batch account can be created to allocate VM pools either in the user's subscription, or outside 
of the user's subscription.

If needed, install the Azure CLI using the instruction found in the [Azure CLI installation guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli), 
and then run `az login` to create a connection with Azure.

This sample works in a Bash shell. For options on running Azure CLI scripts on Windows client, 
see [Running the Azure CLI in Windows](../virtual-machines-windows-cli-options.md).


Accounts that allocate VMs outside of the user's subscription will be subject to a separate core
quota and can be authenticated either via Shared Key credentials or an Azure Active Dirctory token.
An account will be created in this mode by default.

## Batch Account Sample script

[!code-azurecli[main](../../../cli_scripts/batch/create-account/create-account.sh "Create Account")]

Accounts that allocate VMs into the users subscription must be authenticated via an Azure Active
Directory token and the VMs allocated will count towards the user's subscription quota. To create 
an account in this mode, one must specify a Key Vault reference when creating the account.

## Batch Account with User Subscription Pool Allocation Sample script

[!code-azurecli[main](../../../cli_scripts/batch/create-account/create-account-user-subsciption.sh "Create Account using User Subscription")]

## Clean up deployment

After either of the above sample scripts have been run, the following command can be used to remove the
resource group and all related resources (including Batch Acounts, Storage Accounts and Key Vaults).

```azurecli
az group delete --name myResourceGroup
```
