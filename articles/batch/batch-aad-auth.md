# Use Azure Active Directory to authenticate from Batch solutions

Azure Batch supports authentication with [Azure Active Directory][aad_about] (Azure AD) for your Batch solutions. In this article, we'll explore using Azure AD to authenticate from applications that use the Batch Management .NET library or the Batch .NET library. 

## Authenticate Batch management applications with Azure AD

The Batch Management .NET library exposes types for working with Batch accounts, account keys, applications, and application packages. The Batch Management .NET library is an Azure resource provider client, and is used together with [Azure Resource Manager][resman_overview] to manage these resources programmatically. 

Azure AD is required to authenticate requests made through any Azure resource provider client, including the Batch Management .NET library, and through [Azure Resource Manager][resman_overview]. The Batch Management .NET library supports  authentication through Azure AD only.

In this section, we'll use the [AccountManagment][acct_mgmt_sample] sample project, available on GitHub, to walk through using Azure AD with the Batch Management .NET library. The AccountManagement sample is a console application that demonstrates how to access a subscription programmatically, create a new resource group, create a new Batch account, perform some operations on the account, and then delete the new account and resource group. 

### Register your application with Azure AD

Azure AD is Microsoftâ€™s multi-tenant cloud based directory and identity management service. Azure itself uses Azure AD for the authentication of its customers, service administrators, and organizational users. In the context of Batch Management .NET, you use Azure AD to authenticate a subscription administrator or co-administrator. This authenticated user can then issue requests to the Batch service.

The Azure [Active Directory Authentication Library][aad_adal] (ADAL) provides a programmatic interface to Azure AD for use within your applications. To call ADAL from your application, you must register your application in an Azure AD tenant. When you register your application, you provide Azure AD with information about your application, including a name for your application. Azure AD associates this name with two objects that are defined in your Azure AD tenant: the application object and the service principal object. The application object and service principal object are listed in the properties for your registered application. To learn more about these objects, see [Application and service principal objects in Azure Active Directory](../active-directory/develop/active-directory-application-objects.md).

To register the AccountManagement sample application, follow the steps in the [Adding an Application](../active-directory/develop/active-directory-integrating-applications.md#adding-an-application) section in [Integrating applications with Azure Active Directory][aad_integrate]. Specify **Native Client Application** for the type of application. For the **Redirect URI**, you can specify any valid URI (such as `http://myaccountmanagementsample`), as it does not need to be a real endpoint:

![](./media/batch-aad-auth/app-registration-01.png)

Your client application uses the application object ID (also referred to as the client ID) to access Azure AD at runtime. In the AccountManagement sample application, copy your application ID from the Azure portal to the appropriate constant:

```csharp
// Specify the unique identifier (the "Client ID") for your application. This is required so that your
// native client application (i.e. this sample) can access the Microsoft Azure AD Graph API. For information
// about registering an application in Azure Active Directory, please see "Adding an Application" here:
// https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/active-directory-integrating-applications/
private const string ClientId = "your application ID";
```

Also copy the redirect URI that you specified during the registration process.

```csharp
// The URI to which Azure AD will redirect in response to an OAuth 2.0 request. This value is
// specified by you when you register an application with AAD (see ClientId comment). It does not
// need to be a real endpoint, but must be a valid URI (e.g. https://accountmgmtsampleapp).
private const string RedirectUri = "https://batchsampleapp";
```

### Acquire an Azure AD authentication token

In the source code for the AccountManagement sample application, you'll notice constants that provide the endpoint for Azure AD and for Azure Resource Manager. The sample application uses these constants to query Azure AD for subscription information. Leave these constants unchanged:

```csharp
// These endpoints are used during authentication and authorization with AAD.
private const string AuthorityUri = "https://login.microsoftonline.com/common"; // Azure Active Directory "common" endpoint
private const string ResourceUri = "https://management.core.windows.net/";     // Azure service management resource
```

Once you've registered the AccountManagement sample in the Azure AD tenant and provided the necessary constant values within the sample source code, the sample is ready to authenticate using Azure AD. When you run the sample, the ADAL attempts to acquire an authentication token. At this step, it prompts you for for your Microsoft credentials: 

```csharp
// Obtain an access token using the "common" AAD resource. This allows the application
// to query AAD for information that lies outside the application's tenant (such as for
// querying subscription information in your Azure account).
AuthenticationContext authContext = new AuthenticationContext(AuthorityUri);
AuthenticationResult authResult = authContext.AcquireToken(ResourceUri,
                                                        ClientId,
                                                        new Uri(RedirectUri),
                                                        PromptBehavior.Auto);
```

After you provide your service administrator or coadministrator credentials, the sample application can proceed to issue authenticated requests. For more information on running the AccountManagement sample application, see [Manage Batch accounts and quotas with the Batch Management client library for .NET](batch-management-dotnet.md).

> [!NOTE] 
> To run the AccountManagement sample, you'll also need to register the sample application with Azure Resource Manager. For information about how to do this, see [Manage Batch accounts and quotas with the Batch Management client library for .NET](batch-management-dotnet.md).

#### Register the sample with Azure AD

Next, you'll need to delegate permissions to the Azure Resource Manager API. Follow these steps in the Azure portal:

1. In the left-hand navigation pane of the Azure portal, choose **More Services**, click **App Registrations**, and click **Add**.
2. Search for the name of your application in the list of app registrations:

![Search for your application name][5]

3. Display the **Settings** blade. In the **API Access** section, select **Required permissions**.
4. Click **Add** to add a new required permission. 
5. In step 1, enter **Windows Azure Service Management API**, and select that API.
6. In step 2, select the check box next to  **Access Azure Service Management as organization users**.
7. Click the **Done** button.

### Run the sample

Once you've added the application as described above, update `Program.cs` in the [AccountManagment][acct_mgmt_sample] sample project with your application's Redirect URI and Client ID. You can find these values in the **Configure** tab of your application:

![Application configuration in Azure portal][3]

The [AccountManagment][acct_mgmt_sample] sample application demonstrates the following operations:

1. Acquire a security token from Azure AD by using [ADAL][aad_adal]. If the user is not already signed in, they are prompted for their Azure credentials.
2. By using the security token obtained from Azure AD, create a [SubscriptionClient][resman_subclient] to query Azure for a list of subscriptions associated with the account. This allows selection of a subscription if multiple are found.
3. Create a credentials object associated with the selected subscription.
4. Create [ResourceManagementClient][resman_client] by using the credentials.S
5. Use [ResourceManagementClient][resman_client] to create a resource group.
6. Use [BatchManagementClient][net_mgmt_client] to perform several Batch account operations:
   * Create a Batch account in the new resource group.
   * Get the newly created account from the Batch service.
   * Print the account keys for the new account.
   * Regenerate a new primary key for the account.
   * Print the quota information for the account.
   * Print the quota information for the subscription.
   * Print all accounts within the subscription.
   * Delete newly created account.
7. Delete the resource group.

Before deleting the newly created Batch account and resource group, you can inspect both in the [Azure portal][azure_portal]:

## Authenticate Batch service applications with Azure AD

The Batch .NET library provides types for building parallel processing workflows with the Batch service. The Batch service supports both [Shared Key](https://docs.microsoft.com/rest/api/batchservice/authenticate-requests-to-the-azure-batch-service) authentication and authentication through Azure AD. 

Authenticating Batch .NET applications via Azure AD is similar to authenticating Batch Management .NET applications. There are a few differences, which we'll cover in this section.

### Batch service endpoints

The Batch service endpoints differ from those that you use with Batch Management .NET.

The Azure AD endpoint for Batch is:

`https://login.microsoftonline.com/microsoft.onmicrosoft.com`

The resource endpoint for Batch is:

`https://batch.core.windows.net/`

### Grant the Batch service permissions to use Azure AD

Before you can authenticate via Azure AD from your Batch application, you need to register your application with Azure AD and grant access to the Batch API. This process is similar to how you registered the AccountManagement sample application in (ref above).

1. To register your Batch application, follow the steps in the [Adding an Application](../active-directory/develop/active-directory-integrating-applications.md#adding-an-application) section in [Integrating applications with Azure Active Directory][aad_integrate]. For the **Redirect URI**, you can specify any valid URI; it does not need to be a real endpoint.

    ![Register your Batch application with Azure AD](./media/batch-aad-auth/app-registration-data-plane.png)

2. Display the **Settings** blade. In the **API Access** section, select **Required permissions**.
3. In the **Required permissions** blade, click the **Add** button.
4. In step 1, search for **MicrosoftAzureBatch**, select **Microsoft Azure Batch (MicrosoftAzureBatch)**, and click the **Select** button.
5. In step 2, select the check box next to  **Access Azure Batch Service** and click the **Select** button.
6. Click the **Done** button.

The **Required Permissions** blade now shows that your application grants access to both the Azure AD and Azure Batch APIs. 

![API permissions](./media/batch-aad-auth/app-registration-data-plane.png)

### Authentication for Batch accounts in a user subscription.

When you create a new Batch account, you can choose the subscription in which pools are allocated. Your choice affects how you authenticate requests made to resources in that account:

- By default, Batch pools are allocated in a Batch service subscription. If you choose this option, you can authenticate requests to resources in that account with either Shared Key or with Azure AD.
- You can also specify that Batch pools are allocated in a specified user subscription. If you choose this option, you must authenticate requests to resources in that account with Azure AD.

### Best practices for using Azure AD with Batch

An Azure AD authentication token expires after one hour. To ensure that you have a valid token valid for the duration of your Batch jobs, best practices recommend that you retrieve a new token for every request to the Batch service. To achieve this, use a delegate to pass a method that retrieves the token.

At the same time, your BatchClient object should be long-lived   

### Examples using Azure AD with Batch .NET

To write Batch .NET code that authenticates with Azure AD, you'll need to reference the Azure Batch .NET package and the Azure [Active Directory Authentication Library][aad_adal] (ADAL) package.

Include the following `using` statements in your code:

```csharp
using Microsoft.Azure.Batch;
using Microsoft.Azure.Batch.Auth;
using Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory;
```

Reference the Batch service endpoints for Azure AD in your code, for example:  

```csharp
private const string BatchAuthorityUrl = "https://login.microsoftonline.com/microsoft.onmicrosoft.com";
private const string BatchAccountUrl = "https://batch.core.windows.net/";
```
