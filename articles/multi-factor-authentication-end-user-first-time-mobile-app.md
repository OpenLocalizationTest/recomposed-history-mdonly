<li>Click verify.</li>

<li>Click close.  At this point, your verification should be successful.</li>

<li></li>
<li>Now it is recommended that enter your mobile phone number in case you lose access to your mobile app.
<li>Specify your country from the drop-down.</li>
<li>Enter your mobile phone number in the box next to country.</li>
<li>Click Next.</li>
<li>At this point, you have setup your contact method and now it is time to setup app passwords for non-browser apps such as Outlook 2010 or older. If you do not use these apps click **Done**.  Otherwise continue to the next step.
<li>If you are using these apps then copy the app password provided.</li>

<li>Paste the password that was copied to the clipboard into your non-browser application. For steps on individual applications such as Outlook and Lync see How to change the password in your email to the app password and How to change the password in your application to the app password.</li>
<li>Click Done.</li>
