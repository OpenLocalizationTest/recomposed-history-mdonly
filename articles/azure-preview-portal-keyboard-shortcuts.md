# Azure portal keyboard shortcuts 

Azure provides a number of keyboards shortcuts that you can use anywhere in the portal. Some services will have their own keyboard shortcuts, but these portal-wide shortcuts work in any service. The shortcuts will not work when you are working in an editing area, such as a text box, or a console view.
