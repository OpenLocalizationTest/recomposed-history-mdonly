hdinsight-analyze-twitter-data.md:> [WACOM.NOTE] A similar sample is added to the HDInsight Sample Gallery. The following Channel 9 video shows how to run the sample:
hdinsight-analyze-twitter-data.md:>[WACOM.NOTE] A file containing 10,000 tweets and the Hive script file (covered in the next section) have been uploaded in a public Blob container. You can skip this section if you want to use the uploaded files. 
hdinsight-analyze-twitter-data.md:>[WACOM.NOTE] The Hive script file and a file containing 10,000 tweets have been uploaded in a public Blob container. You can skip this section if you want to use the uploaded files.
hdinsight-analyze-twitter-data.md:>[WACOM.NOTE] To use the tweets and the HiveQL script you uploaded in the last two sections, set $hqlScriptFile to "/tutorials/twitter/twitter.hql". To use the ones that have been uploaded to a public blob for you, set $hqlScriptFile to "wasb://twittertrend@hditutorialdata.blob.core.windows.net/twitter.hql".
hdinsight-get-started.md:> [WACOM.NOTE] If you are new to Hadoop and Big Data, you can read more about the terms [Apache Hadoop][apache-hadoop], [MapReduce][apache-mapreduce], [HDFS][apache-hdfs], and  [Hive][apache-hive]. To understand how HDInsight enables Hadoop in Azure, see [Introduction to Hadoop in HDInsight][hadoop-hdinsight-intro].
hdinsight-get-started.md:>[WACOM.NOTE] Don't share a default Blob storage container with multiple HDInsight clusters. 
hdinsight-get-started.md:	>[WACOM.NOTE]  The QUICK CREATE option to provision an HDInsight cluster (like the one we use in this tutorial) does not ask for a location when you are provisioning the cluster. Instead, by default, it co-locates the cluster in the same datacenter as the storage account. So, make sure you create your storage account in a location that is supported for the cluster. These are:  **East Asia**, **Southeast Asia**, **North Europe**, **West Europe**, **East US**, **West US**, **North Central US**, **South Central US**.
hdinsight-get-started.md:[WACOM.INCLUDE [provisioningnote](../includes/hdinsight-provisioning.md)]
hdinsight-get-started.md:	>[WACOM.NOTE] The previous procedure creates a cluster by using HDInsight version 3.1. To create cluster with other versions, use the **Custom Create** method from the portal or use Azure PowerShell. For information about what's different between each version, see [What's new in the cluster versions provided by HDInsight?][hdinsight-versions]. For information about using the **CUSTOM CREATE** option, see [Provision HDInsight clusters using custom options][hdinsight-provision].
hdinsight-get-started.md:> [WACOM.NOTE] HDInsight Tools for Visual Studio comes with the Azure SDK for .NET version 2.5 or later. By using the tools in Visual Studio, you can connect to HDInsight cluster, create Hive tables, and run Hive queries. For more information, see [Get started using HDInsight Hadoop Tools for Visual Studio][1].
hdinsight-get-started.md:	> [WACOM.NOTE] Note that the URL of the webpage is *&lt;ClusterName&gt;.azurehdinsight.net*. So instead of opening the dashboard from the portal, you can open the dashboard from a web browser by using the URL.
hdinsight-get-started.md:	> [WACOM.NOTE] The **Job Session** table on the **Hive Editor** tab lists completed or running jobs if you stay on that tab. The table does not list any jobs if you navigate away from the page. The **Job History** tab maintains a list of all jobs, completed or running.
hdinsight-hadoop-cluster-scaling.md:> [WACOM.NOTE] The client machine must have Azure PowerShell version 0.8.14 or higher installed to use this command.
hdinsight-hbase-analyze-twitter-sentiment.md:	> [WACOM.NOTE] The Twitter application name must be an unique name.  
hdinsight-hbase-provision-vnet.md:	> [WACOM.NOTE] It is highly recommended to designate a single subnet for one cluster. 
hdinsight-hbase-provision-vnet.md:> [WACOM.NOTE] HDInsight clusters use Azure Blob storage for storing data. For more information, see [Use Azure Blob storage with Hadoop in HDInsight][hdinsight-storage]. You will need a storage account and a Blob storage container. The storage account location must match the virtual network location and the cluster location.
hdinsight-hbase-provision-vnet.md:> [WACOM.NOTE] For information on provisioning a new HBase cluster by using Azure PowerShell, see [Provision an HBase cluster using Azure PowerShell](#powershell).
hdinsight-hbase-provision-vnet.md:	> [WACOM.NOTE] For an HBase cluster, Windows Server is the only available OS option.
hdinsight-hbase-provision-vnet.md:	>[WACOM.NOTE] Based on the choice of VMs, your cost might vary. HDInsight uses all standard-tier VMs for cluster nodes. For information on how VM sizes affect your prices, see <a href="http://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/hdinsight/" target="_blank">HDInsight Pricing</a>.	
hdinsight-hbase-provision-vnet.md:	> [WACOM.NOTE] You can also use Remote Desktop to connect to the HBase cluster (you will be connected to the head node) and run **ipconfig** from a command prompt to obtain the DNS suffix. For instructions on enabling Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) and connecting to the cluster by using RDP, see [Manage Hadoop clusters in HDInsight using the Azure portal][hdinsight-admin-portal].
hdinsight-hbase-provision-vnet.md:> [WACOM.NOTE] For more information on name resolution in Azure virtual networks, including how to use your own DNS server, see [Name Resolution (DNS)](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/jj156088.aspx).
hdinsight-provision-clusters.md:>[WACOM.NOTE] Don't share one Blob storage container for multiple clusters. This is not supported.

hdinsight-provision-clusters.md:	>[WACOM.NOTE] The Azure SQL database used for the metastore must allow connectivity to other Azure services, including Azure HDInsight. On the Azure SQL database dashboard, on the right side, click the server name. This is the server on which the SQL database instance is running. Once you are on the server view, click **Configure**, and then for **Windows Azure Services**, click **Yes**, and then click **Save**.
hdinsight-provision-clusters.md:    > [WACOM.NOTE] Once an Azure Storage account is chosen for your HDInsight cluster, you can neither delete the account nor change the account to a different account.
hdinsight-provision-clusters.md:> [WACOM.NOTE] While the scripts in this section can be used to configure an HDInsight cluster on an Azure virtual network, they will not create an Azure virtual network. For information on creating an Azure virtual network, see [Virtual Network configuration tasks](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/jj156206.aspx).
hdinsight-provision-clusters.md:> [WACOM.NOTE] The Azure PowerShell cmdlets are the only recommended way to change configuration variables in an HDInsight cluster. Changes made to Hadoop configuration files while connected to the cluster via Remote Desktop may be overwritten in the event of cluster patching. Configuration values set via Azure PowerShell will be preserved if the cluster is patched.
hdinsight-provision-clusters.md:	>[WACOM.NOTE] The $hadoopUserName and $hadoopUserPassword commands are used to create the Hadoop user account for the cluster. You will use this account to connect to the cluster and run jobs. If you use the Quick Create option from the Azure portal to provision a cluster, the default Hadoop user name is "admin". Don't confuse this account with the Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) user account. The RDP user account has to be different from the Hadoop user account. For more information, see [Manage Hadoop clusters in HDInsight using the Azure Management Portal][hdinsight-admin-portal].
hdinsight-provision-clusters.md:> [WACOM.NOTE] The Windows PowerShell cmdlets are the only recommended way to change configuration variables in an HDInsight cluster.
