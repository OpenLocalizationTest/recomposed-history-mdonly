## Troubleshooting steps

To resolve the issue, first try to [reset the Azure VPN Gateway](vpn-gateway-resetgw-classic.md) and reset the Tunnel from the on-premises VPN device. If the problem is not resolved, follow these steps to identify the cause of the problem.

### Step 1 Check if the on-premises VPN device is validated

Check if you are using a [validated VPN device and OS version](vpn-gateway-about-vpn-devices.md#a-namedevicetableavalidated-vpn-devices-and-device-configuration-guides). If it is not a validated VPN device, you may need to contact device manufacturer to see if there is any compatibility issue.

### Step 2 Check if the Shared Key(PSK) matches

Compare the **Shared Key** from on-premises VPN device and the virtual network VPN to ensure the key matches. 

To view the PSK for the Azure VPN connection, use one of the following methodsï¼š

**Azure portal**

1. Go to virtual network gateway >site to site conection you created.
2. In the **Settings** section, click **Shared Key**.

**Azure PowerShell**

For Resource Manager mode

    Get-AzureRmVirtualNetworkGatewayConnectionSharedKey -Name <Connection name> -ResourceGroupName <Resource group name>

For Classic

    Get-AzureVNetGatewayKey -VNetName -LocalNetworkSiteName

### Step 3 Validate VPN Peer IPs
