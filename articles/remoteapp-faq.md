#Azure RemoteApp FAQ
We've heard the following questions about Azure RemoteApp. Have others? Visit the [RemoteApp forums](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/azure/en-US/home?forum=AzureRemoteApp) and let us know what you need to know.

##What is Azure RemoteApp?##


- **What is Azure RemoteApp?** Azure RemoteApp is an Azure service that delivers the functionality of the on-premises Microsoft RemoteApp, backed by Remote Desktop Services, from Azure. Azure RemoteApp lets you provide secure, remote access to applications from many different user devices. Read more  about [Azure RemoteApp](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/remoteapp-whatis/).
- **What are the two kinds of deployment options?** There are two kinds of RemoteApp deployments: cloud and hybrid. Figure out which [deployment option](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/remoteapp-whatis/) works best for your organization .

##Supported configurations##


- **Are custom line-of-business (LOB) applications supported?** Yes. To use a custom application in Azure RemoteApp, create a [custom template image](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/remoteapp-create-custom-image/), and then upload it to the RemoteApp service.
- **Will my custom LOB application work in Azure RemoteApp?** The best way to figure that out is to test it. Review the [application compatibility requirements](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=18704) and check out the [RD Compatibility Center](http://www.rdcompatibility.com/compatibility/default.aspx).
- **Which deployment method (cloud or hybrid) is best for my organization?** Hybrid deployments provide the most complete experience if you want full integration with single sign-on (SSO) and secure on-premises network connectivity. Cloud deployments provide an agile and easy way to isolate your deployment by using multiple authentication methods. Read more about the [deployment options](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/remoteapp-whatis/).
- **The hybrid deployment requires a VNET. Can we use our existing NET?** Not right now, but we know that you want to. While we're working on that, you can connect your existing VNET to the Azure RemoteApp VNET by following [these instructions](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/rds/archive/2014/07/21/how-to-link-azure-remoteapp-to-an-existing-vnet.aspx).
- **Can I use a cloud or existing virtual machine as the template for my RemoteApp service? **Not right now, but this is a popular request on our [feedback site](http://feedback.azure.com/forums/247748-azure-remoteapp/suggestions/5923679-allow-creation-of-custom-hybrid-image-completely-w).
- **We have SQL or another database either on-premises or in Azure. Which deployment type should we use?** That depends on where your SQL or backend database is. If the database is in a private network, use the hybrid deployment. If the database is exposed to the Internet and allows client connections to connect to it, you can use the cloud deployment.
- **What about drive mapping, USB and serial port, clipboard sharing, and printer redirection?** All of those features are supported in Azure RemoteApp. Clipboard sharing and printer redirection is enabled by default. [Contact us](mailto:remoteappforum@microsoft.com?subject=Azure%20RemoteApp%20enable%20Redirection%20request) to enable drive mapping or USB or serial port redirection. (We're working on adding this support to the portal, but it's not there yet.)
- **How about authentication? Which methods are supported?** The cloud deployment supports Microsoft accounts and Azure Active Directory accounts, which are Office 365 accounts as well. The hybrid deployment supports only Azure Active Directory accounts that have been synced (using a tool like DirSync) from a Windows Server Active Directory deployment; specifically, either synced with the Password Synchronization option or synced with Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS) federation configured. You can also configure [Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/services/multi-factor-authentication/).

	**Note:** The Azure Active Directory users must be from the tenant that's associated with your subscription. (You can view and modify your subscription on the **Settings** tab in the portal. See [Change the Azure Active Directory tenant used by RemoteApp](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/3d6c4fd1-c981-4c57-9402-59fe31b11883) for more information.

- **Why can't I give my Azure Active Directory account access?** The Azure Active Directory users must be from the directory that's associated with your subscription. You can view or modify that directory on the Settings tab in the portal. See [Change the Azure Active Directory tenant used by RemoteApp](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/3d6c4fd1-c981-4c57-9402-59fe31b11883) for more information.
- **Which devices and operating systems do the client applications support?** Client applications are available for Windows 8.1, Windows 8, Windows 7 Service Pack 1, iOS, Mac OS X, Windows RT, Android devices, and Windows Phone. We also support the Windows 10 preview.
 
	[Download](https://www.remoteapp.windowsazure.com/ClientDownload/AllClients.aspx) a RemoteApp client now.

	- Windows Embedded Standard 7 with Service Pack 1
	- Windows Embedded POSReady7 
	- Windows Embedded Thin PC 
	- Windows Embedded 8.1 Industry

- **Which version of Windows Server is supported for the Remote Desktop Session Host (RDSH)?** Windows Server 2012 R2.
