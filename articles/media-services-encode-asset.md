#Encoding with Azure Media Services

##Overview

Media Services supports the following encoders:

- Azure Media Encoder


By default each Media Services account can have one active encoding task at a time. You can reserve encoding units that allow you to have multiple encoding tasks running concurrently, one for each encoding reserved unit you purchase. For information about scaling encoding units, see the following **Portal** and **.NET** topics.

##Azure Media Encoder

[Formats Supported by the Media Services Encoder](../media-services-azure-media-encoder-formats)  – Discusses the file and stream formats supported by Media Services

The **Azure Media Encoder** is configured using one of the encoder preset strings described [here](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn619392.aspx).

Encode with **Azure Media Encoder** using **Azure Management Portal**, **.NET**, or **REST API**.
