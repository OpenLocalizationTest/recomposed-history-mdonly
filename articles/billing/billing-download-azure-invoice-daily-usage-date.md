# How to get your Azure billing invoice and daily usage data
You can opt-in and configure additional recipients to receive your invoice statement attached to your monthly billing email. You can also download your invoice from the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Billing/SubscriptionsBlade). Only the account administrator has permission to get to the billing invoice and usage information. To find out who is the account administrator of the subscription, see the [Transferring ownership of an Azure subscription - FAQ](billing-subscription-transfer.md#faq).

## Get your invoice over email
1. Select your subscription from the subscriptions blade. You have to opt-in for each subscription you own. Click **Invoices** then **Email my invoice**. You may not see this if you are not the account admin.

2. **Opt in** and accept the terms:

You can also access this blade deep link in your monthly statement notification email

## I can't access the email settings blade:
* You must be the account administrator to configure this setting, not sure what this means? Learn more here.
* If you have a monthly invoice but aren't receiving an email, make sure you have your communication email properly set.
* This feature may not be available for certain subscriptions such as support offers, Enterprise Agreements, or Azure in Open.

## Get invoice from Azure portal
You can view the daily usage from the Azure portal but only the invoice is available for download.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) as the account administrator. 
2. On the Hub menu, select **Subscriptions**.

For more information about your invoice see [Understand your bill for Microsoft Azure](billing-understand-your-bill.md).

## Get usage from the Azure Account Center

5. Select **View Current Statement** to see an estimate of your charges at the time the estimate was generated. This information is only updated daily and may not include all your usage. Your monthly invoice may differ from this estimate.

## <a name="noinvoice"></a> Why don't I see an invoice for the last billing period?
There could be several reasons that you don't see an invoice:
- You have a monthly credit amount with your subscription that you didn't exceed or you have a free trial. An invoice isn't generated unless you owe money.
- It's less than 30 days from the day you subscribed to Azure.
- The invoice isn't generated yet. Wait until the end of the billing period.
