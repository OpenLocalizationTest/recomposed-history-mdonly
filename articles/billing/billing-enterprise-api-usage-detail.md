# Reporting APIs for Enterprise customers - Usage Details

The Usage Detail API offers a daily breakdown of consumed quantities and estimated charges by an Enrollment. The result also includes information on instances, meters and departments. The API can be queried by Billing period or by a specified start and end date. 
## Consumption APIs


##Request 
Common header properties that need to be added are specified [here](billing-enterprise-api.md). If a billing period is not specified, then data for the current billing period is returned. Custom time ranges can be specified with the start and end date parameters that are in the format yyyy-MM-dd. The maximum supported time range is 36 months.  

|Method | Request URI|
|-|-|
|GET|https://consumption.azure.com/v2/enrollments/{enrollmentNumber}/usagedetails 
|GET|https://consumption.azure.com/v2/enrollments/{enrollmentNumber}/billingPeriods/{billingPeriod}/usagedetails|
|GET|https://consumption.azure.com/v2/enrollments/{enrollmentNumber}/usagedetailsbycustomdate?startTime=2017-01-01&endTime=2017-01-10|

Note: To use the preview version of the API, please replace V2 by V1 in the above URI.
