# Programmatically get billing and usage info with Azure Billing APIs
Use the Azure Invoice Download, Resource Usage, and Rate Card APIs to programmatically get billing information and usage details. These APIs are implemented as a Resource Provider, as part of the family of APIs exposed by the Azure Resource Manager.  

## Azure Invoice Download API (Preview)
Download your invoice using the preview version of [Invoice API](/rest/api/billing). The features include:

* **Azure Role-based Access Control** - Configure your access policies on the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) or through [Azure PowerShell cmdlets](/powershell/azureps-cmdlets-docs) to specify which users or applications can get access to the subscription's invoices. Use standard Azure Active Directory tokens for authentication. You have to be either the Billing Reader, Reader, Owner, or Contributor role to get access to the invoices.
* **Date Filtering** - Use the `$filter` parameter to get all the invoices in reverse chronological order by the invoice period end date. 

> [!NOTE]
> This feature is in preview and may be subject to backward-incompatible changes. It also may not be available for Azure Germany, Azure China, and Azure Government.

## Azure Resource Usage API (Preview)
Use the [Azure Resource Usage API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/mt219003.aspx) to get your estimated Azure consumption data. The features include:

* **Azure Role-based Access Control** - Configure your access policies on the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) or through [Azure PowerShell cmdlets](/powershell/azureps-cmdlets-docs) to specify which users or applications can get access to the subscription's usage data. Use standard Azure Active Directory tokens for authentication. You have to be either the Billing Reader, Reader, Owner, or Contributor role to get access to the usage data for a particular Azure subscription.
* **Hourly or Daily Aggregations** - Specify whether you want your Azure usage data in hourly buckets or daily buckets. The default is daily.
* **Instance metadata provided (includes resource tags)** – Instance-level details such as the fully qualified resource uri (`/subscriptions/{subscription-id}/...`), along with the resource group information and resource tags are provided in the response. This feature helps you deterministically and programmatically allocate usage by the tags, for use-cases like cross-charging.
* **Resource metadata provided** - Resource details such as the meter name, meter category, meter sub category, unit, and region are passed in the response, to give the callers a better understanding of what was consumed. We are also working to align resource metadata terminology across the Azure portal, Azure usage CSV, EA billing CSV, and other public-facing experiences, to enable you to correlate data across experiences.
* **Usage for all offer types** – Usage data is accessible for all offer types including Pay-as-you-go, MSDN, Monetary commitment, Monetary credit, and EA among others.

## Azure Resource RateCard API (Preview)
Use the [Azure Resource RateCard API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/mt219005.aspx) to get the list of available Azure resources, along with estimated pricing information for each. The features include:

* **Azure Role-based Access Control** - Configure your access policies on the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) or through [Azure PowerShell cmdlets](/powershell/azureps-cmdlets-docs) to specify which users or applications can get access to the RateCard data. Use standard Azure Active Directory tokens for authentication. You have to be either the Billing Reader, Reader, Owner, or Contributor role to get access to the usage data for a particular Azure subscription.
* **Support for Pay-as-you-go, MSDN, Monetary commitment, and Monetary credit offers (EA not supported)** - This API provides Azure offer-level rate information, vs. subscription-level.  The caller of this API must pass in the offer information to get resource details and rates.  As EA offers have customized rates per enrollment, we are unable to provide the EA rates currently.

## Scenarios
Here are some of the scenarios that are made possible with the combination of the Usage and the RateCard APIs:

* **Azure spend during the month** - Use the Usage and RateCard APIs in combination to get better insights into your cloud spend during the month, by analyzing the hourly and daily buckets of usage and charge estimates.
* **Set up alerts** – set up resource-based or monetary-based alerts on your cloud consumption by getting the estimated consumption and charge estimate using the Usage and the RateCard API.
* **Predict bill** – get your estimated consumption and cloud spend and apply machine learning algorithms to predict what your bill would be at the end of the billing cycle.
* **Pre-consumption cost analysis** – Use the RateCard API to predict how much your bill would be if you were to move your workloads to Azure, by providing desired usage numbers. If you have existing workloads in other clouds or private clouds, you can also map your usage with the Azure rates to get a better estimate of your estimated Azure spend. This API provides an enhanced view of what can be obtained via the [Azure Pricing Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/), as (for example) our Billing partners help pivot on offer and compare/contrast between different offer types beyond Pay-As-You-Go. The APIs also help do cost estimation changes by region, enabling the type of what-if analysis required to make deployment decisions, as deploying resources in different DCs around the world can have a direct impact on total cost.
* **What-if analysis** -
  
  * Determine whether it would be more cost-effective to run your workloads in another region, or on another configuration of the Azure resource. Azure resource costs may differ based on the Azure region in which you are running, and this allows you to get cost optimizations.
  * Also determine if another Azure offer type gives a better rate on an Azure resource.

## Partner solutions
[Microsoft Azure Usage and RateCard APIs Enable Cloudyn to Provide ITFM for Customers](billing-usage-rate-card-partner-solution-cloudyn.md) describes the integration experience offered by Azure Billing API partner [Cloudyn](https://www.cloudyn.com/microsoft-azure/).  This article provides detailed coverage of your experiences, including a short video that shows how an Azure customer can use Cloudyn and the Azure Billing APIs to gains insights from your Azure consumption data.
