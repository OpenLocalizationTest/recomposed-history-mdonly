# Share your Office 365 Azure AD tenant and its users with a new Azure subscription or vice versa
If you already have an Office 365 subscription, you can use the existing Office 365 user accounts with a new Azure subscription. Alternatively, if you're Azure subscriber, you can get an Office 365 subscription for the users in your existing Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). The account you use for the Office 365 sign-up must be a member of the Global Admin or Billing Admin directory role in your Azure Active Directory tenant. For more information, see [Check my account permissions in Azure AD](#RoleInAzureAD) and [Assigning administrator roles in Azure Active Directory](../active-directory/active-directory-assign-admin-roles.md).

If you already have both an Office 365 account and an Azure subscription, see [Associate an Office 365 tenant to an Azure subscription](billing-add-office-365-tenant-to-azure-subscription.md).

This article doesnâ€™t apply to Enterprise Agreement (EA) customers.

## Get Office 365 subscription for users in existing Azure Active Directory
If you already have an Azure subscription and want to get an Office 365 subscription, sign in to Office 365 with your Azure account and complete the sign-up. The account you use for the Office 365 sign-up must be a member of the Global Admin or Billing Admin directory role in your Azure Active Directory tenant. After you complete the sign-up, the Office 365 subscription is added to the same Azure Active Directory instance that your Azure subscription belongs to. 

To subscribe to Office 365, follow these steps:

1. Go to the [Office 365 product page](https://products.office.com/business), and then select a plan that is suitable for you.
2. Click **Sign in** on the upper-right corner of the page.

## More about Azure and Office 365 subscriptions
Office 365 and Azure use the Azure AD service to manage users and subscriptions. The Azure directory is like container in which you can group users and subscriptions. To use the same user accounts for your Azure and Office 365 subscriptions, you need to make sure that the subscriptions are created in the same directory. Keep in mind the following points:

* A subscription gets created under a directory.
* Users belong to directories.
* A subscription lands in the directory of the user who creates the subscription. So your Office 365 subscription is tied to the same account as your Azure subscription.
* Azure subscriptions are owned by individual users in the directory.
* Office 365 subscriptions are owned by the directory itself. Users with the right permissions within the directory can manage these subscriptions.
