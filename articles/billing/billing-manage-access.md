# How to manage access to subscription billing
The access to viewing billing information is granted to users in certain roles on the Azure subscription. The user roles who can read billing information are Account Administrator, Service Administrator, Co-administrator, Owner, Contributor, Reader and Billing Reader.
Account Administrator and Billing Reader are billing only roles and do not have any access to service management operations.

Account Administrator and Billing Reader are billing only roles and do not have any access to service management operations. Account administrator role is an inbuilt role that is granted to the user who created the subscription. Account administrator has full permissions to manage the subscription. Users in Billing Reader role have read access to subscription scoped billing information. The common scenario for Billing Reader is ability to delegate access to billing information for a subscription without giving any access to perform service management. This role is appropriate for users in an organization who perform financial/cost management for Azure subscriptions. The user in this role can view cost information in the Azure management portal and download invoices for the subscription. The inbuilt Azure roles Owner, Contributor and Reader have same permissions as Billing Reader, in addition users in these roles can perform service management operations.
