# Managing access to billing information for Azure

Access to viewing billing information in Azure portal is granted to users in certain roles on the Azure subscription. The user roles who have access to billing information are Account Administrator, Service Administrator, Co-administrator, Owner, Contributor, Reader, and Billing Reader. They would have access to billing information in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), and they can use the Billing API to download invoices.

> [!NOTE]
> Only the Account Administrator can access the [Azure Account Center](https://account.windowsazure.com). 

## Adding users to the Billing Reader role

A Billing Reader has read-only access to subscription billing information in Azure portal, and no access to services such as VMs and storage accounts. The common use case for the Billing Reader role is delegating access to billing information for a subscription without giving the ability to manage Azure service. This role is appropriate for users in an organization who only perform financial and cost management for Azure subscriptions. Users in this role can view billing information in the Azure portal and download invoices for the subscription.

1. Select your subscription from the [Subscriptions blade](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Billing/SubscriptionsBlade) in Azure portal.
    
2. Select **Access control (IAM)** and then click **Add**.

3. Choose **Billing Reader** in the "Select a role" page.

4. Follow instructions in the invite email to log in as a Billing Reader.

## Adding users to other roles 

Users in other roles, such as Owner or Contributor, can access not just billing information, but Azure services as well. To manage these roles, see [Add or change Azure administrator roles that manage the subscription or services](billing-add-change-azure-subscription-administrator.md).

The user roles who have access to billing information are Account Administrator, Service Administrator, Co-administrator, Owner, Contributor, Reader, and Billing Reader.

## Who can access the [Account Center](https://account.windowsazure.com)?

Only the Account Administrator can log in to the Account center. The Account Administrator is the legal owner of the subscription. By default, the person who signed up for or bought the Azure subscription is the Account Administrator, unless the [subscription ownership was transferred](billing-subscription-transfer.md) to somebody else. The Account Administrator can create subscriptions, cancel subscriptions, change the billing address for a subscription, and manage access policies for the subscription.
