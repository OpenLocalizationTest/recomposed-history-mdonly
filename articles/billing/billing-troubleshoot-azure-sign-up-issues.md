# I can't sign up for Azure
If you can't sign up for Azure, there are several things you can check to troubleshoot the issue.

## Progress bar hangs in "Identity verification by card" section

During Azure sign-up, there's a section called "Identity verification by card". If the progress bar hangs:

This issue occurs when third-party cookies are blocked for your browser.

### Suggestion

1. Allow third-party cookies in your browser settings.
  * In Edge, go to Settings -> View advanced settings -> Cookies, select "Don't block cookies".
  * In Chrome, go to Settings -> Show advanced settings -> Privacy -> Content settings, uncheck "Block third-party cookies and site data".
2. Refresh the Azure sign-up page, and check if the problem is resolved.
3. If the refresh didn't solve the issue, quit and restart your browser then try again.

## No text messages or calls during sign up account verification
* It may take up to four minutes for your text code to be delivered if you choose "Send text message."
* Verify that your phone number can receive SMS.
* Double check the phone number you entered, including the country code selection in the dropdown menu.
* Be sure your phone can receive text messages (SMS) if you use "Send text message," or phone calls if you choose the "Call me" alternative.
* When you receive the text message, insert the code in the text box, and click the verification button to proceed.

### Suggestions
* If you do not receive text messages (SMS) in your phone, use the "call me" alternate verification method.
* Use another phone number if the phone verification step fails using both SMS and "Call me" methods.
* A VOIP phone number cannot be used for the phone verification process.

## Credit card declined or not accepted
Make sure that the payment method you are using at sign-up is a supported payment method, or learn more about why [your debit card or credit card is declined at Azure sign up](billing-credit-card-fails-during-azure-sign-up.md).

## "Free Trial is not available"
Have you used an Azure subscription in the past? The Azure Terms of Use agreement limits free trial activation only for a user that's new to Azure. If you have had any other type of Azure subscription, you can't activate a free trial.

### Suggestion
* Consider signing up for a [Pay-As-You-Go subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/offers/ms-azr-0003p/).

## Can’t activate Azure benefit plan like MSDN, BizSpark, BizSparkPlus, or MPN
Make sure you are using the right login credentials and verify through your benefit program channel if you are eligible for the chosen plan:

* MSDN
  * Verify your eligibility status in your [MSDN account page](https://msdn.microsoft.com/subscriptions/manage/default.aspx).
  * If you cannot verify your status, contact the [MSDN Subscriptions Customer Service Centers](https://msdn.microsoft.com/subscriptions/contactus.aspx)
* MPN
  * Sign in to the [MPN portal](https://mspartner.microsoft.com/en/us/Pages/Locale.aspx) and verify your eligibility status. If you have the appropriate [Cloud Platform Competencies](https://mspartner.microsoft.com/en/us/pages/membership/cloud-platform-competency.aspx), you may be eligible for additional benefits.
  * If you cannot verify your status, contact [MPN support](https://mspartner.microsoft.com/en/us/Pages/Support/Premium/contact-support.aspx).
* Bizpark
  * Sign in to the [BizSpark portal](https://www.microsoft.com/bizspark/default.aspx#start-two) and verify your eligibility status for BizSpark and BizSpark Plus.
  * If you cannot verify your status, contact Bizspark Support sending an email to [Contact BizSpark Team](mailto:bizspark@microsoft.com?subject=BizSpark%20Support&body=Thank%20you%20for%20contacting%20BizSpark.%20Please%20provide%20as%20much%20of%20the%20following%20information%20as%20possible,%20as%20it%20will%20help%20expedite%20our%20response%20to%20you.%0aContact%20name:%0aStartup%20name:%0aMicrosoft%20Account/Live%20ID:%0aSpecific%20description%20of%20issue%20experienced%20or%20question:%0a%0aThank%20you,%0a%0aThe%20BizSpark%20Team)

## Can’t activate new Azure In Open subscription
You must have a valid OSA key with at least one Azure In Open token associated to it to create a new Azure In Open subscription.

### Suggestion
If you do not have an OSA key, contact one of Microsoft Partners listed in [Microsoft Pinpoint](http://pinpoint.microsoft.com/).
