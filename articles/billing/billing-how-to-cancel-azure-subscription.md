# Cancel your subscription for Azure

You can cancel your Azure subscription as the [Account Administrator](billing-subscription-transfer.md#whoisaa). After you cancel the subscription, your access to Azure services and resources ends.

Before you cancel your subscription:

* Back up your data. For example, if you're storing data in Azure storage or SQL, download a copy. If you have a virtual machine, save an image of it locally.
* Shut down your services. Go to the [resources page in the management portal](https://ms.portal.azure.com/?flight=1#blade/HubsExtension/Resources/resourceType/Microsoft.Resources%2Fresources), and **Stop** any running virtual machines, applications, or other services.
* Consider migrating your data. See [Move resources to new resource group or subscription](../azure-resource-manager/resource-group-move-resources.md).

If you cancel a paid [Azure Support plan](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/plans/), you are still billed monthly for the rest of the 6-months term.

## Cancel subscription via the Azure portal

1. Select your subscription from the [Subscriptions blade](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Billing/SubscriptionsBlade).

1. Select the subscription that you want to cancel and click **Cancel subscription**.

## Cancel subscription by using the Azure Account Center

1. Sign in to the [Azure Account Center](https://account.windowsazure.com/subscriptions) as the Account Administrator.

1. Under **Click a subscription to view details and usage**, select the subscription that you want to cancel.

1. Click ![Check symbol button](./media/billing-how-to-cancel-azure-subscription/checkbutton.png) to close the dialog window and return to your subscription page.

## What happens after I cancel my subscription?

Once you cancel, billing is stopped immediately. However, it can take up to 10 minutes for the cancellation to be reflected in the portal.

After that, your services get disabled. That means your virtual machines are deallocated, temporary IP addresses are freed,and storage becomes read-only.

If you're currently paying for Azure (i.e. you're not on Free Trial), any outstanding charges for usage before the cancellation is billed to you at the end of the billing cycle. So, in this case, you should expect one more bill after cancelling.

After you cancel your subscription, we wait 90 days before permanently deleting your data in case you need to access it or you change your mind. We do not charge you for retaining the data. To learn more, see [Microsoft Trust Center - How we manage your data](https://go.microsoft.com/fwLink/p/?LinkID=822930&clcid=0x409).

## Reactivate subscription

If you canceled your Pay-As-You-Go subscription accidentally, you can [reactivate it in the Accounts Center](billing-subscription-become-disable.md).

If your subscription is not Pay-As-You-Go, contact support within 90 days of cancellation to reactivate your subscription.

## Need help? Contact support.

If you still have questions, [contact support](https://portal.azure.com/?#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade) to get your issue resolved quickly.
