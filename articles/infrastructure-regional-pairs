# Improve Business Continuity using Azure Regional Pairs

Azure operates in multiple geographies around the world, and multiple regions within each geography. Each region houses at least one datacenter and is paired with one other region. Applications replicated across paired regions benefit from Azure’s isolation and availability policies and can expect a consistent application state in the event of primary region loss.

A regional pair is made up of a primary and a secondary region, together making the pair. The primary region of an Azure service is configured upon creation. Table 1 lists the mappings of regional pairs



| Primary Region      | Secondary Region |
| :-------------      |-------------     |
| North Central US    | South Central US |
| South Central US    | North Central US |
| US East             | US West          |
| US West             | US East          |
| US East 2           | US Central       |
| US Central          | US East 2        |
| North Europe        | West Europe      |
| West Europe         | North Europe     |
| South East Asia     | East Asia        |
| East Asia           | South East Asia  |
| East China          | North China      |
| North China         | East China       |
| Japan East          | Japan West       |
| Japan West          | Japan East       |
| Brazil South (1)    | South Central US |
| Australia East      | Australia Southeast |
| Australia Southeast	| Australia East   |
Table 1 - Mapping of azure regional pairs

> (1) The one exception to this rule is Brazil South, which is paired with US South Central. We are identifying alternatives to allow Brazil deployments to keep their data local to the geography.  Going forward, all newly introduced regions will be paired with regions in the same geography.

Figure 1 (below) shows a hypothetical primary and paired region within an Azure geography. The green-colored numbers highlight the cross-region interactions of three Azure services (Azure Compute, Storage, and Database). The figure shows the different ways an Azure service may (or may not, sometimes by design) utilize the construct of a paired region. For example, using Geo-Redundant storage (GRS), Azure Storage restricts replication only to a paired region. However, SQL Premium Geo-Replication allows you to replicate to any region in the world. It is important to understand the benefits of a paired region before configuring a replication target.

The orange-colored numbers highlight the unique advantages of replicating to a paired region as opposed to a non-paired region.

Figure 1 shows a simplified view of how select Azure services operate across regions. Please visit Azure.com to get more details about the cross-region interactions of a specific service.

![Overview of Paired Region Benefits](./media/infrastructure-paired-regions/PairedRegionsOverview.png)

![1Green](./media/infrastructure-regional-pairs/1Green.png) **Azure Compute** – Additional compute resources can be deployed to any region in the world, but secondary workloads must be provisioned in advanced in order to protect against a regional outage. Since some Azure services do not offer the choice of arbitrary replication targets (they replicate only to the paired region), departing from the regional pairing means that no single region will contain all of the application state in the event of primary region loss.

![2Green](./media/infrastructure-regional-pairs/2Green.png) **Azure Storage** - Azure Storage enables Geo-Redundant storage (GRS) by default when a storage account is created. With GRS, your data is replicated three times within the primary region, and is replicated three times in the secondary region. For more information, see [Azure Storage Redundancy Options](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/storage-redundancy/). GRS is an example of a platform service that does not offer the choice of arbitrary replication targets.


![3Green](./media/infrastructure-regional-pairs/3Green.png) **Azure SQL Databases** – With Azure SQL Geo-Replication, you can configure a user database to replicate transactions to databases on different Microsoft Azure SQL Database servers. Standard Geo-Replication allows replication only to a paired region, while Premium Geo-replication allows replication to any region in the world. For more information, see [Geo-Replication in Azure SQL Database](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/azure/dn783447.aspx)

![4Green](./media/infrastructure-regional-pairs/4Green.png) **Independent management services** - Azure guarantees logical isolation of service management components across two regions within the same pair.  This means logical failures in one region are less likely to impact another.

![5Orange](./media/infrastructure-regional-pairs/5Orange.png)
**Physical isolation** - When possible, Azure prefers at least 500 miles of separation between datacenters in a regional pair, although this is not practical or possible in all geographies. Physical datacenter separation reduces the likelihood of natural disasters (fire, flood, meteor strike, tornado), civil unrest, power outages, or physical network outages affecting both regions at once. Isolation is subject to the constraints within the geography (geography size, power/network infrastructure availability, regulation).

![6Orange](./media/infrastructure-regional-pairs/6Orange.png)
**Region recovery order** – In the event of a broad outage, recovery of one region will be prioritized out of every pair.  Applications that are deployed across paired regions are guaranteed to have one of the regions recovered with priority.  If an application is deployed across regions that are not paired, recovery may be delayed – in the worst case the chosen regions may be the last two to be recovered.

![7Orange](./media/infrastructure-regional-pairs/7Orange.png)
**Sequential updates** – Planned Azure system updates are rolled out to paired regions sequentially (not at the same time) to minimize downtime, the effect of bugs, and logical failures if an update is faulty.

![8Orange](./media/infrastructure-regional-pairs/8Orange.png)
**Data residency** – A paired region always resides within the same geography as its pair  in order to meet data residency requirements for tax and law enforcement jurisdiction purposes.
