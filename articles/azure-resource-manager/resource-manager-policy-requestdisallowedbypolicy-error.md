# RequestDisallowedByPolicy error with the resource policy

## Symptom

When you try to perform an action during deployment, you might receive a **RequestDisallowedByPolicy** error that prevents the action be performed. The following is a sample of the error:

```
{
  "statusCode": "Forbidden",
  "serviceRequestId": null,
  "statusMessage": "{\"error\":{\"code\":\"RequestDisallowedByPolicy\",\"message\":\"The resource action 'Microsoft.Network/publicIpAddresses/write' is disallowed by one or more policies. Policy identifier(s): '/subscriptions/{guid}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyDefinitions/regionPolicyDefinition'.\"}}",
  "responseBody": "{\"error\":{\"code\":\"RequestDisallowedByPolicy\",\"message\":\"The resource action 'Microsoft.Network/publicIpAddresses/write' is disallowed by one or more policies. Policy identifier(s): '/subscriptions/{guid}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyDefinitions/regionPolicyDefinition'.\"}}"
}
```

## Troubleshooting

To retrieve details about the policy that blocked your deployment, use the following one of the methods:

### Method 1

In PowerShell, provide that policy identifier as the **Id** parameter to retrieve details about the policy that blocked your deployment.

```PowerShell
(Get-AzureRmPolicyDefinition -Id "/subscriptions/{guid}/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyDefinitions/regionPolicyDefinition").Properties.policyRule | ConvertTo-Json
```

### Method 2 

In Azure CLI 2.0, provide the name of the policy definition: 

```azurecli
az policy definition show --name regionPolicyAssignment
```

## Solution

For security or compliance reasons, your IT department might enforce a resource policy that prohibits creation of Public IP address, Network Security Group, User-Defined Routes, or route tables. In the sample of the error that is described in "Symptoms", the policy is named **regionPolicyDefinition**, but it could be different. 

To resolve the problem, work with the IT Department to review the resource policies, and check how to perform the requested action in compliance.
