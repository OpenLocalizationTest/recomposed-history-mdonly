# RequestDisallowedByPolicy error with the resource policy

## Symptoms

Your Microsoft Azure subscription has a [resource  policy](resource-manager-policy.md) configured. When you try to perform an action during depolyment, you might receive a **RequestDisallowedByPolicy** error that prevent the action be performed. The following is a sample of the error:


```
{
  "statusCode": "Forbidden",
  "serviceRequestId": null,
  "statusMessage": "{\"error\":{\"code\":\"RequestDisallowedByPolicy\",\"message\":\"The resource action 'Microsoft.Network/publicIpAddresses/write' is disallowed by one or more policies. Policy identifier(s): '/subscriptions/<ID>/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyDefinitions/SDOStdPolicyNetwork'.\"}}",
  "responseBody": "{\"error\":{\"code\":\"RequestDisallowedByPolicy\",\"message\":\"The resource action 'Microsoft.Network/publicIpAddresses/write' is disallowed by one or more policies. Policy identifier(s): '/subscriptions/<ID>/providers/Microsoft.Authorization/policyDefinitions/SDOStdPolicyNetwork'.\"}}"
}
```

## Solution

For security reasons, your IT department might enforce a resource policy that prohibits creation of Public IP address, Network Security Group, User-Defined Routes, or route tables if your subscription has an ExpressRoute circuit. In the sample of the error that is described in "Symptoms", the policy is named **SDOStdPolicyNetwork**. The name could be different in your subscription.
