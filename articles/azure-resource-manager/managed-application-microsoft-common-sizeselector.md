# Microsoft.Compute.SizeSelector UI element
A control for selecting a size for one or more virtual machine instances.

## UI sample
![Microsoft.Compute.SizeSelector](./media/managed-application-elements/microsoft.compute.sizeselector.png)

## Schema
```json
{
  "name": "element1",
  "type": "Microsoft.Compute.SizeSelector",
  "label": "Size",
  "toolTip": "",
  "recommendedSizes": [
    "Standard_D1",
    "Standard_D2",
    "Standard_D3"
  ],
  "constraints": {
    "allowedSizes": [],
    "excludedSizes": []
  },
  "osPlatform": "Windows",
  "imageReference": {
    "publisher": "MicrosoftWindowsServer",
    "offer": "WindowsServer",
    "sku": "2012-R2-Datacenter"
  },
  "count": 2,
  "visible": true
}
```

## Remarks
- `recommendedSizes` should contain at least 1 size. The first recommended size
will be used as the default.
- Any size in `recommendedSizes` will be automatically skipped if it's not
available in the selected location, and the next recommended size will be used
in its place.
- Any size not specified in the `constraints.allowedSizes` will be hidden, and
any size not specified in `constraints.excludedSizes` will be shown.
`constraints.allowedSizes` and `constraints.excludedSizes` are both optional,
but cannot be used simultaneously. The list of available sizes can be determined
by calling [this API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/mt269440.aspx).
- `osPlatform` must be specified, and can be either `Windows` or `Linux`. It's
used to determine the hardware costs of the virtual machines.
- `imageReference` must be omitted for first-party images, and should be provided
for third-party images. It's used to determine the software costs of the virtual
machines.
- `count` is used to set the appropriate multiplier for the element. It supports
a static value, like `2`, or a dynamic value from another element, like
`[steps('step1').vmCount]`. The default value is `1`.

## Output
```json
"Standard_D1"
```
