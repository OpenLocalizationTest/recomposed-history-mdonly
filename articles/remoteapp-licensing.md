#How does licensing work in Azure RemoteApp?


So you've set up your Azure RemoteApp service, created your templates, and are ready to publish apps to your users. But there's still one last thing to figure out: licensing. What's the deal with licensing for the apps you share through RemoteApp?

You can offer any app or program to which you hold the license. 

As part of your Azure RemoteApp subscription you will not need to purchase Windows licenses and or Remote Desktop CALs, these are all included in the cost of the subscription.

If you want to use the Office 365 template image that comes with Azure RemoteApp, you must have an *existing* Office 365 ProPlus plan. The same is true for any Office 365 app that you publish using a custom template. You need to activate the apps with your own subscription. This is true for both trial and paid subscriptions. If you want to use the Office 365 template image during the trial, *and you don't already have a subscription*, go to the Office 365 page to [sign up](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=403802) for a trial subscription. See [How do RemoteApp and Office work together?](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/remoteapp-o365/) for more information.

If, during the trial period, you don't want to get an Office 365 trial subscription, use the Office 2013 Professional Plus template image that comes with RemoteApp. This template image can only be used for 30 days and cannot be converted into a paid collection. After the trial period ends, you'll need to delete the collection and create a new one if you want to use Office 2013 moving forward.  

That makes sense, right? You can publish any app that you are legally entitled to share. And you need to make sure you really are entitled to share your programs.

Please note that you cannot use a CAL or Volume License agreement in a cloud collection. You *can* use a Volume License agreement to activate applications in your hybrid collection (except for Office). You just need to install them on your template image from the Volume License media. Follow the information from the application vendor to install licenses in a Remote Desktop environment.
