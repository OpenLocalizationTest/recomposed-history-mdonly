#Windows Azure Web Sites Backups

The Windows Azure Web Sites Backups feature lets you easily create web site backups manually or automatically. You can restore your web site to a previous state, or create a new web site based on one of your original site's backups. The Backups feature is available only in Standard mode. 

> [WACOM.NOTE] During Preview, backup and restore operations are available only through the Windows Azure Management Portal.

For information on restoring a Windows Azure web site from backup, see [Restore a Windows Azure web site](http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/documentation/articles/web-sites-restore/).

##What is Backed Up 
Windows Azure Web Sites backs up the following information:

* Web site configuration
* Web site file content
* The linked SQL or MySQL databases that you specify

This information is backed up to the Windows Azure storage account that you specify.

##Requirements and Restrictions
* The Backups feature requires Standard mode. In the portal, use the **Scale** tab to scale your site to Standard mode, or click **Scale your site now** on the **Backups** tab.

* The Backups feature requires an associated Windows Azure storage account. If you do not yet have a storage account, you can create one by selecting the Storage (grid) icon in the left pane of the Windows Azure portal, and then choosing **New** in the command bar at the bottom.

* Backups can only be made to the same region that the web site is in.

## The Backups tab

To make a manual, on-demand backup, choose **Backup Now** in the command bar at the bottom of the portal page. The backup is made to the storage account that you specify in the **Storage Account** option, and will also include any databases that you specify in the **Included Databases** option. You can make a manual backup at any time, but no more than 2 manual backups can be made in a 24-hour period. 

**Automated Backup** - When this option is set to OFF, automated backups are disabled, but manual backup and restore are available. When Automated Backup is set to ON, the **Frequency** and **Start Date** options are enabled so that you can schedule backups.

> [WACOM.NOTE] Because they are also used to configure manual backups, the **Storage Account** and **Included Databases** options are always on, regardless of whether **Automated Backup** is On or Off.

**Storage account** - Choose which of your Windows Azure storage accounts you want to use to store your backups for this web site. The storage account that you choose must be in the same subscription as the subscription for the web site that you are backing up
. If you do not have a storage account, you can create one in the Windows Azure portal.

> [WACOM.NOTE] Although you can back up more than one web site to the same storage account, for ease of maintenance, consider creating a separate storage account for each web site.

After you have made one or more backups, they will be visible on the **Containers** tab of your storage account. Manual backups will be in a container called **websitebackups**; automated backups will be in a container called **automatedwebsitebackups**. Each backup consists of a .zip file that contains the backed up data and an .xml file that contains a manifest of the .zip file contents.

**Frequency** - Choose how often you want automatic backups to be made. During Preview, the number of days is the only time unit available. The number of days must be between 1 and 90, inclusive. 

> [WACOM.NOTE] If you choose to include one or more databases in the backup and specify a frequency of less than 7 days, you will warned that frequent backups can increase your database costs.

**Start Date** - Specify a date and time for automated backups to start. Times are available in half-hour increments.

> [WACOM.NOTE] Windows Azure stores backup times in UTC format, but displays them in accordance with the system time on the computer that you are using to display the portal.

**Included Databases** - Optionally select one or more SQL or MySQL databases to include in your backup. For a database to appear in the list, its connection string must exist in the **Connection Strings** section of the **Configure** tab in the portal.

If you have no databases linked to your web site, you can click the link to go to the **Linked Resources** tab where you can specify or create a database to link to your web site.
