# How to Do Data Science in Azure

This Azure Data Science Process map demonstrates the use of the Azure platform for data science and building operationalized models using Azure Machine Learning. The map walks a user through typical data science tasks such as ingesting data from various sources, preparing it for use in Azure Machine Learning, and using Azure Machine Learning to create operational models that can be consumed by end user applications (programmatically or otherwise). While the map shows the core steps involved in a typical end-to-end data science exercise, not all steps are required and their sequence can vary depending on the location, size and complexity of the data.

The step titled **Advanced data processing in Azure** links to a second map. If and you are returning from that map, continue down from that point to ingesting the processed data in Azure Machine Learning studio and building and deploying models.
