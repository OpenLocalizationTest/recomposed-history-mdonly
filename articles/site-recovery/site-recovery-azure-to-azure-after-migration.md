# Replicate Azure VMs to another region after migration to Azure using Azure Site Recovery

## Overview

This article details the guidance to prepare Azure virtual machines for replication between two Azure regions after these machines have been migrated from on-premises environment to Azure using Azure Site Recovery (ASR).

## Why protect your machines after migrating to Azure?
Today, more and more enterprises are moving their workloads to Azure. With enterprises moving mission-critical on-premises production workloads to Azure, setting up disaster recovery for these workloads is mandatory for compliance reasons and to safeguard against any disruptions in an Azure region.

##Preparatory steps
Below are the steps to prepare migrated machines for setting up to replication to another Azure region.

1. Complete migration

2. Install the Azure agent if needed

3. Remove the mobility service  

4. Restart the VM

### Step 1 - Migrate workloads running on Hyper-V VMs, VMware VMs, and physical servers, to run on Azure VMs:

Follow the steps detailed in this [article](site-recovery-migrate-to-azure.md) to setup replication and migrate your on-premises Hyper-V, VMware and physical workloads to Azure.

After migration, you don't need to commit a failover, or delete it. Instead, you select the **Complete Migration** option for each machine you want to migrate.
     - In **Replicated Items**, right-click the VM, and click **Complete Migration**. Click **OK** to complete. You can track progress in the VM properties, in by monitoring the Complete Migration job in **Site Recovery jobs**.
     - The **Complete Migration** action finishes up the migration process, removes replication for the machine, and stops Site Recovery billing for the machine.

### Step 2 - Install the Azure VM Agent on the virtual machine
The Azure VM Agent must be installed on the virtual machine for the Site Recovery extension to work and to protect the VM.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>Beginning with version 9.7.0.0, on Windows virtual machines (VMs), the Mobility Service installer > also installs the latest available Azure VM agent. On migration, the virtual machine meets the
> agent installation prerequisite for using any VM extension, including the Site Recovery extension. The Azure VM agent needs to be manually installed only if the mobility service installed on the migrated machine is of version 9.6 and below.

 Learn about the [VM Agent](../virtual-machines/windows/classic/agents-and-extensions.md#azure-vm-agents-for-windows-and-linux).

The following table provides additional information about installing and validating that the VM Agent for Windows and Linux VMs is installed.

| **Operation** | **Windows** | **Linux** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Installing the VM Agent |Download and install the [agent MSI](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=394789&clcid=0x409). You will need Administrator privileges to complete the installation. |<li> Install the latest [Linux agent](../virtual-machines/linux/agent-user-guide.md). You will need Administrator privileges to complete the installation. We recommend installing agent from your distribution repository. We **do not recommend** installing Linux VM agent directly from github.  |
| Validating the VM Agent installation |<li>Navigate to the *C:\WindowsAzure\Packages* folder in the Azure VM. <li>You should find the WaAppAgent.exe file present.<li> Right-click the file, go to **Properties**, and then select the **Details** tab. The Product Version field should be 2.6.1198.718 or higher. |N/A |


### Step 3 - Remove Mobility Service from the migrated virtual machine

If you have migrated your on-premises VMware machines or physical servers on Windows/Linux, you need to manually remove/uninstall the mobility service from the migrated virtual machine.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>This step is not required for Hyper-V VMs migrated to Azure.

#### Uninstall Mobility Service on a Windows Server VM
Use one of the following methods to uninstall Mobility Service on a Windows Server computer.

##### Uninstall by using the GUI
1. In Control Panel, select **Programs**.
2. Select **Microsoft Azure Site Recovery Mobility Service/Master Target server**, and then select **Uninstall**.

##### Uninstall at a command prompt
1. Open a Command Prompt window as an administrator.
2. To uninstall Mobility Service, run the following command:

```
MsiExec.exe /qn /x {275197FC-14FD-4560-A5EB-38217F80CBD1} /L+*V "C:\ProgramData\ASRSetupLogs\UnifiedAgentMSIUninstall.log"
```

#### Uninstall Mobility Service on a Linux computer
1. On your Linux server, sign in as a **root** user.
2. In a terminal, go to /user/local/ASR.
3. To uninstall Mobility Service, run the following command:

```
uninstall.sh -Y
```

### Step 4 - Restart the VM

Once you uninstall the mobility service, restart the VM at your convenience before you setup replication to another Azure region.
