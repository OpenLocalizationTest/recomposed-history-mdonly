# Manage a Scale-out Process server

Configuration server acts as a coordinator between the Site Recovery services and your on-premises infrastructure. This article describes how you can set up, configure, and manage the Configuration server.

## Prerequisites
The minimum hardware, software and network configuration required to setup a configuration is as listed below.

> [!NOTE]
> [Capacity planning](site-recovery-plan-capacity-vmare.md) is an important step to ensure that you deploy the Configuration server with a configuration that suites your load requirements. Read more about [Sizing requirements for a Configuration server](#sizing-requirements-for-a-configuration-server).

[!INCLUDE [site-recovery-configuration-server-requirements](../../includes/site-recovery-configuration-server-requirements.md)]

## Downloading the Scale-out Process server software
1. Log on to the Azure Portal and browse to your Recovery Services Vault.
2. Browse to **Site Recovery Infrastructure** > **Configuration Servers** (under For VMware & Physical Machines).

  ![Add Servers Page](./media/site-recovery-vmware-to-azure-manage-configuration-server/AddServers.png)
