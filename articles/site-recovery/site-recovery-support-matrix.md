# Azure Site Recovery support matrix

This article summarizes supported operating systems and components for Azure Site Recovery. A list of supported components and prerequisites is available for each deployment scenario in each the corresponding deployment article, and this document summarizes them.

## Supported operating systems for virtualization servers

### Operating systems - replication to Azure

**VMware VM/physical server** | **Hyper-V (no VMM)** | **Hyper-V (with VMM)**
--- | --- | ---
vCenter 5.5 or 6.0 (support for 5.5 features only) <br/><br/> vSphere 6.0, 5.5, or 5.1 with latest updates | Windows Server 2012 R2 with latest updates | Windows Server 2012 R2 with latest updates

### Operating systems - replication to secondary site

**VMware VM/physical server** | **Hyper-V (with VMM)**
--- | --- | ---
vCenter 5.5 or 6.0 (support for 5.5 features only) <br/><br/> vSphere 6.0, 5.5, or 5.1 with latest updates | At least Windows Server 2012 with latest updates


## Support requirements for replicated machines

### Replicated machines - replication to Azure

Virtual machines must meet [Azure requirements](site-recovery-best-practices.md#azure-virtual-machine-requirements).

**Requirement** | **VMware/physical server** | **Hyper-V (no VMM)** | **Hyper-V (with VMM)**
--- | --- | --- | ---
What's replicated | Any workload on Windows or Linux VM | Any workload | Any workload
Host OS | 64-bit Windows Server 2012 R2, Windows Server 2012, Windows Server 2008 R2 with at least SP1<br/><br/> Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6.7, 7.1, 7.2 <br/><br/> Centos 6.5, 6.6, 6.7, 7.0, 7.1, 7.2 <br/><br/> Oracle Enterprise Linux 6.4, 6.5 running either the Red Hat compatible kernel or Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel Release 3 (UEK3) <br/><br/> SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP3<bbr/><br/> Storage required: File system (EXT3, ETX4, ReiserFS, XFS); Multipath software-Device Mapper (multipath)); Volume manager: (LVM2). Physical servers with HP CCISS controller storage are not supported. The ReiserFS filesystem is supported only on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 11 SP3. | Any guest OS [supported by Azure](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc794868.aspx) | Any guest OS [supported by Azure](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc794868.aspx)
