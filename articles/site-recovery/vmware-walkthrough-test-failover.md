# Step 12: un a test failover to Azure for VMware VMs

This article describes how to run a test failover from  on-premises VMware virtual machines to Azure, using the [Azure Site Recovery](site-recovery-overview.md) service in the Azure portal.

Post comments and questions at the bottom of this article, or on the [Azure Recovery Services Forum](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/azure/home?forum=hypervrecovmgr).


## Before you start

Before you run a test failover we recommend that you verify the VM properties, and make any changes you need to. you can access the VM properties in **Replicated items**. The **Essentials** blade shows information about machines settings and status.

## Modify VM settings

1. In **Compute and Network** > **Compute properties**, you can specify the Azure VM name and target size.
4. Modify the name to comply with [Azure requirements](site-recovery-support-matrix-to-azure.md#failed-over-azure-vm-requirements) if you need to.
3. Modify the network/subnet in which the Azure VM will be located after failover, and the IP address that will be assigned to it.
5. In **Disks**, view the VM operating system, and the data disks that will be replicated. You can set **Use managed disks** to **Yes** if you want to attach managed disks to to the Azure VM after failover to Azure. Managed disks simplify VM managed by managing the storage accounts associated with the VM disks.

## Set target IP addresses

You can set the target IP address for an Azure VM created after failover.

- If you don't provide an address, the failed over machine will use DHCP.
- If you set an address that isn't available at failover, failover won't work.
- The same target IP address can be used for test failover, if the address is available in the test failover network.
- The number of network adapters is dictated by the size you specify for the target virtual machine:

     - If the number of network adapters on the source machine is the same as, or less than, the number of adapters allowed for the target machine size, then the target will have the same number of adapters as the source.
     - If the number of adapters for the source virtual machine exceeds the number allowed for the target size, then the target size maximum will be used.
     - For example, if a source machine has two network adapters and the target machine size supports four, the target machine will have two adapters. If the source machine has two adapters but the supported target size only supports one then the target machine will have only one adapter.     
   - If the virtual machine has multiple network adapters they will all connect to the same network.
   - If the virtual machine has multiple network adapters then the first one shown in the list becomes the *Default* network adapter in the Azure virtual machine.
 - [Learn more](site-recovery-network-design.md) about IP addressing.


## Set up managed disks

If you enable the option to use managed disks, note that:

- When you enable protection for a VM, VM data replicates to a storage account. Managed disks are created and attached to the VM only when failover occurs.
- Managed disks can be created only for VMs deployed using the Resource Manager model.  
- With this setting enabled, only availability sets in Resource Groups that have **Use managed disks** enabled can be selected. VMs with managed disks must be in availability sets with **Use managed disks** set to **Yes**. If the setting isn't enabled for VMs, then only availability sets in Resource Groups without managed disks enabled can be selected.
- [Learn more](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/virtual-machines/windows/manage-availability#use-managed-disks-for-vms-in-an-availability-set) about managed disks and availability sets.
- If the storage account you use for replication has been encrypted with Storage Service Encryption, managed disks can't be created during failover. In this case either don't enable use of managed disks, or disable protection for the VM, and reenable it to use a storage account that doesn't have encryption enabled.

## Run a test failover


After you've set everything up, run a test failover to make sure everything's working as expected. Get a quick video overview before you start
>[!VIDEO https://channel9.msdn.com/Series/Azure-Site-Recovery/VMware-to-Azure-with-ASR-Video4-Recovery-Plan-DR-Drill-and-Failover/player]


1. To fail over a single machine, in **Settings** > **Replicated Items**, click the VM > **+Test Failover** icon.

    ![Test failover](./media/vmware-walkthrough-test-failover/test-failover.png)

2. To fail over a recovery plan, in **Settings** > **Recovery Plans**, right-click the plan > **Test Failover**. To create a recovery plan, [follow these instructions](site-recovery-create-recovery-plans.md).  

3. In **Test Failover**, select the Azure network to which Azure VMs will be connected after failover occurs.

4. Click **OK** to begin the failover. You can track progress by clicking on the VM to open its properties, or on the **Test Failover** job in vault name > **Settings** > **Jobs** > **Site Recovery jobs**.

5. After the failover completes, you should also be able to see the replica Azure machine appear in the Azure portal > **Virtual Machines**. You should make sure that the VM is the appropriate size, that it's connected to the appropriate network, and that it's running.

6. If you [prepared for connections after failover](site-recovery-test-failover-to-azure.md#prepare-to-connect-to-azure-vms-after-failover), you should be able to connect to the Azure VM.

7. Once you're done, click on **Cleanup test failover** on the recovery plan. In **Notes**, record and save any observations associated with the test failover. This will delete the VMs that were created during test failover.

[Learn more](site-recovery-test-failover-to-azure.md) about test failovers.



## Next steps

After you get replication up and running, when an outage occurs you fail over to Azure, and Azure VMs are created from the replicated data. You can then access workloads and apps in Azure, until you fail back to your primary location when it returns to normal operations.

- [Learn more](site-recovery-failover.md) about different types of failovers, and how to run them.
- If you're migrating machines rather than replicating and failing back, [read more](site-recovery-migrate-to-azure.md#migrate-on-premises-vms-and-physical-servers).
- [Read about failback](site-recovery-failback-azure-to-vmware.md), to fail back and replicate Azure VMs back to the primary on-premises site.
