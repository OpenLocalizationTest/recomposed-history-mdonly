# Azure Site Recovery: Frequently asked questions (FAQ)

This article includes frequently asked questions about Site Recovery.

If you still have questions after reading the article you can post them at the bottom of this article, or on the [Azure Recovery Services Forum](https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/azure/home?forum=hypervrecovmgr).


## Overview

Site Recovery contributes to your business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR) strategy by helping to ensure that workloads and apps remain available when outages occurs. Site Recovery  orchestrates and automates replication of on-premises virtual machines and physical servers to Azure, or to a secondary datacenter. [Learn more](site-recovery-overview.md).


### What can Site Recovery protect?

- **Hyper-V virtual machines**: Site Recovery can protect any workload running on a Hyper-V VM. 
- **Physical servers**: Site Recovery can protect workloads running on Windows/Linux physical servers.
- **VMware virtual machines**: Site Recovery can protect any workload running on a VMware VM.


### What are the Hyper-V requirements?

The requirements for the Hyper-V host server depend on the deployment scenario. Check the prerequisites in:

- [Replicating Hyper-V VMs (without VMM) to Azure](site-recovery-hyper-v-site-to-azure.md#before-you-start)
- [Replicating Hyper-V VMs (with VMM) to Azure](site-recovery-vmm-to-azure.md#before-you-start)
- [Replicating Hyper-V VMs to a secondary datacenter](site-recovery-vmm-to-vmm.md#before-you-start)

Requirements for the guests running on the Hyper-V host server: 

- If you're replicating to a secondary site read about the supported guest operating systems for VMs in [Supported guest operating systems for Hyper-V VMs](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/mt126277.aspx) running on Hyper-V host servers.
- If you're replicating to Azure, Site Recovery supports all the guest operating systems that are [supported by Azure](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/cc794868%28v=ws.10%29.aspx).


### Can I protect VMs when Hyper-V is running on a client operating system?

No, VMs must be located on a Hyper-V host server running a supported Windows server machine. If you need to protect a client computer you could replicate it as a physical machine [to Azure](site-recovery-vmware-to-azure-classic.md), or a [secondary datacenter](site-recovery-vmware-to-vmware.md).


### What workloads can I protect with Site Recovery?

Site Recovery can replicate most workloads running on a supported VM or physical server. Site Recovery also provides support for application-aware replication so that apps can be recovered to an intelligent state. It integrates with Microsoft applications, including SharePoint, Exchange, Dynamics, SQL Server and Active Directory, and works closely with leading vendors including Oracle, SAP, IBM and Red Hat. [Learn more](site-recovery-workload.md) about workload protection.


### Do I always need a System Center VMM server to protect Hyper-V virtual machines? 

If you want to replicate to a secondary datacenter then Hyper-V VMs must be located on Hyper-V hosts servers in a VMM cloud. But if you want to replicate to Azure then you can replicate VMs on Hyper-V host servers with or without VMM clouds. [Learn more](site-recovery-hyper-v-site-to-azure.md). 

### Can I deploy Site Recovery with VMM if I only have one VMM server? 

Yes. You can either replicate Hyper-V VMs in the cloud on the VMM server to Azure, or you can  replicate between VMM clouds on the same server. For on-premises to on-premises replication we do recommend that you have a VMM server in both the primary and secondary sites. [Read more](site-recovery-single-vmm.md)

### What physical servers can I protect?

You can protect physical servers running Windows and Linux, to Azure or to a secondary site. [Learn](site-recovery-vmware-to-azure-classic.md#before-you-start-deployment) about operating system requirements. The same limitations apply whether you're replicating physical servers to Azure or to a secondary site.

Note that physical servers will run as VMs in Azure if your on-premises server goes down. Failback to an on-premises physical server isn't currently supported. You can only fail back to a virtual machine running on VMware.

### What VMware VMs can I protect?

To protect VMware VMs you'll need a vSphere hypervisor, and virtual machines running VMware tools. We also recommend that you have a VMware vCenter server to manage the hypervisors. Lea[Learn more](site-recovery-vmware-to-azure-classic.md#before-you-start-deployment) about exact requirements  for VMware servers and VMs. The same limitations apply whether you're replicating VMware VMs to Azure or to a secondary site.

### Are there any prerequisites for replicating virtual machines to Azure?

Virtual machines you want to replicate to Azure should comply with [Azure requirements](site-recovery-best-practices.md#azure-virtual-machine-requirements).

### Can I replicate Hyper-V generation 2 virtual machines to Azure?

Yes. Site Recovery converts VMs from generation 2 to generation 1 during failover. At failback the VM is converted back to generation 2. [Read more](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/2015/04/28/disaster-recovery-to-azure-enhanced-and-were-listening/).

### If I replicate to Azure how do I pay for Azure VMs? 

During regular replication, data is replicated to geo-redundant Azure storage and you donâ€™t need to pay any Azure IaaS virtual machine charges, providing a significant advantage. When you run a failover to Azure, Site Recovery automatically creates Azure IaaS virtual machines, and after that you'll be billed for the compute resources that you consume in Azure.

### Can I manage disaster recovery for my branch offices with Site Recovery?

Yes. When you use Site Recovery to orchestrate replication and failover in your branch offices, you'll get a unified orchestration and view of all your branch office workloads in a central location. You can easily run failovers and administer disaster recovery  of all branches from your head office, without visiting the branches. 

### Is there an SDK I can use to automate the Site Recovery workflow?

Yes. You can automate Site Recovery workflows using the Rest API, PowerShell, or the Azure SDK. Learn more about [Deploying Site Recovery using PowerShell and Azure Resource Manager](site-recovery-deploy-with-powershell-resource-manager.md).


## Security and compliance

### Is replication data sent to the Site Recovery service?

No, Site Recovery doesn't intercept replicated data or have any information about what's running on your virtual machines or physical servers.

Replication data is exchanged between on-premises Hyper-V hosts, VMware hypervisors, or physical servers and Azure storage or your secondary site.  Site Recovery has no ability to intercept that data. Only the metadata needed to orchestrate replication and failover is sent to the Site Recovery service. 

Site Recovery is ISO 27001:2005-certified, and is in the process of completing its HIPAA, DPA, and FedRAMP JAB assessments.

### For compliance, even metadata from our on-premises environments must remain within the same geographic region. Can Site Recovery do this?

Yes. When you create a Site Recovery vault in a region, we ensure that all metadata that we need to enable and orchestrate replication and failover remains within that region's geographic boundary.

### Does Site Recovery encrypt replication?
For virtual machines and physical servers replicating etween on-premises sites encryption-in-transit is supported. For virtual machines and physical servers replicating to Azure both encryption-in-transit and encryption-at-rest(in Azure) is supported. 




## Replication and failover

### If I replicate to Azure what kind of storage account do I need?

You'll need a storage account with [standard geo-redundant storage](../storage/storage-introduction.md#replication-for-durability-and-high-availability). Premium storage isn't currently supported.

### How often can I replicate data?
- **Hyper-V:** Hyper-V VMs running on Windows Server 2012 R2 can be replicated every 30 seconds, 5 minutes or 15 minutes. If you've set up SAN replication then replication will be synchronous.
- **VMware and physical servers:** A replication frequency isn't relevant here. Replication will be continuous. 

### Can I extend replication from existing recovery site to another recovery site?
Extended or chained replication isn't supported. [Send us feedback](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/256299-site-recovery/suggestions/6097959-support-for-exisiting-extended-replication/) about this feature.


### Can I do an offline replication the first time I replicate to Azure? 

This isn't supported. [Send us feedback](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/256299-site-recovery/suggestions/6227386-support-for-offline-replication-data-transfer-from/) about this feature.


### Can I exclude specific disks from replication?

This isn't supported. [Send us feedback](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/256299-site-recovery/suggestions/6418801-exclude-disks-from-replication/) about this feature.

### Can I replicate virtual machines with  dynamic disks?

Dynamic disks are supported when replicating Hyper-V virtual machines. They're not supported when replicating VMware virtual machines or physical servers. [Send us feedback](https://feedback.azure.com/forums/256299-site-recovery/) about this feature.

### How do I access Azure virtual machines after failover to Azure? 

You can access the Azure VMs over a secure Internet connection, over a site-to-site VPN, or over Azure ExpressRoute. Communications over a VPN connection are to internal ports on the Azure network on which the VM is located. Communications over the internet are mapped to the public endpoints on the Azure cloud service for the VMs.

### For failover to Azure, how does Azure make sure my data is resilient?

Azure is designed for resilience. Site Recovery is already engineered for failover to a secondary Azure datacenter in accordance with the Azure SLA if the need arises. If this happens we make sure your metadata and vaults remain within the same geographic region that you chose for your vault. 

### If I'm replicating between two sites, what happens if my primary site experiences an unexpected outage?

You can trigger an unplanned failover from the secondary site. Site Recovery doesn't need connectivity from the primary site to perform the failover.


### Is failover automatic?

Failover isn't automatic. You initiate failovers with single click in the portal, or you can use [Site Recovery PowerShell cmdlets](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn850420.aspx) to trigger a failover.Failback is a series of actions in the Site Recovery portal.

To automate failover you could use on-premises Orchestrator or Operations Manager to detect a virtual machine failure, and then trigger the failover using the SDK.

### Can I throttle bandwidth allotted for Hyper-V replication traffic?
- If you're replicating between Hyper-V VMs two on-premises sites then you can use Windows QoS. Here's a sample script: 

    	New-NetQosPolicy -Name ASRReplication -IPDstPortMatchCondition 8084 -ThrottleRate (2048*1024)
    	gpupdate.exe /force

- If you're replicating Hyper-V VMs to Azure then you can configure throttling using the following sample PowerShell cmdlet:

    	Set-OBMachineSetting -WorkDay $mon, $tue -StartWorkHour "9:00:00" -EndWorkHour "18:00:00" -WorkHourBandwidth (512*1024) -NonWorkHourBandwidth (2048*1024)

- [Learn more](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/3056159) about throttling Hyper-V traffic.
- [Learn more](site-recovery-vmware-to-azure-classic.md#capacity-planning) about throttling VMware replication to Azure.



## Service Provider deployment

### Does Site Recovery work for dedicated or shared infrastructure models?
Yes, Site Recovery supports both dedicated and shared infrastructure models.

### Is the identity of my tenant shared with the Site Recovery service?
No. In fact, your tenants don't need access to the Site Recovery portal. Only the service provider administrator interacts with the portal.


### Will my tenants' application data ever go to Azure?
When replicating between service provider-owned sites, application data never goes to Azure. Data is encrypted in-transit and replicated directly between the service provider sites.

If you're replicating to Azure, application data is sent to Azure storage but not to the Site Recovery service. Data is encrypted in-transit and remains encrypted in Azure. 

### Will my tenants receive a bill for any Azure services?

No. Azure's billing relationship is directly with the service provider. Service providers are responsible for generating specific bills for their tenants.

### If I'm replicating to Azure, do we need to run virtual machines in Azure at all times?

No. Data is replicated to a geo-redundant Azure storage account in your subscription. When you perform a test failover (DR drill) or an actual failover, Site Recovery automatically creates virtual machines in your subscription.

### Do you ensure tenant-level isolation when I replicate to Azure?

Yes.

### What platforms do you currently support?

We support Azure Pack, Cloud Platform System, and System Center (2012 and higher) deployments. Learn more about Azure Pack integration in [Configure protection for virtual machines](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/dn850370.aspx).

### Do you support single Azure Pack and single VMM server deployments?

Yes, you can replicate Hyper-V virtual virtual machines and Azure, or between service provider sites.  Note that if you replicate between service provider sites Azure runbook integration isn't available.
