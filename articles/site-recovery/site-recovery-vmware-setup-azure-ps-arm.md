This article describes how to set up & configure a Process Server in Azure for failing back virtual machines from Azure to on-premises.

> [!NOTE]
> This article is to be used if you used **Resource Manager** as the deployment model for the virtual machines during failover. If you used **Classic** as the deployment model follow the steps in [How to setup & configure a Failback Process Server (Classic)](./site-recovery-vmware-setup-azure-ps-classic.md)

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [site-recovery-vmware-process-server-prerequ](../../includes/site-recovery-vmware-azure-process-server-prereq.md)]

## Deploy Process Server on Azure
1. In the Vault > **Site Recovery Infrastructure** (under the "Manage" heading) > **Configuration Servers** (under "For VMware and Physical Machines" heading) select the configuration server.
2. In the Configuration Server details page that opens click "+ Process server"
