# Networking guidance for replicating Azure virtual machines


This article details the networking guidance for Azure Site Recovery when replicating and recovering Azure virtual machines from one region to another region. For more about Azure Site Recovery requirements, see the [prerequisites](site-recovery-prereq.md).

## Outbound connectivity for Azure Site Recovery URLs or IP ranges

If you are using any firewall proxy to control outbound internet connectivity, ensure you whitelist all the required Azure Site recovery service URLs or the IP ranges mentioned below are whitelisted.

### URLs

**URL** | **Purpose**  
--- | ---
*.blob.core.windows.net | Required so that data can be written to the cache storage account form the VM.
login.microsoftonline.com | Required for authorization and authentication to the Site recovery service URLs.
*.hypervrecoverymanager.windowsazure.com | Required so that the Site recovery service communication can happen from the VM.
*.servicebus.windows.net | Required so that the Site recovery monitoring and diagnostics data  can be written from the VM.
.

### IP ranges

Below are the IP ranges that need to be white-listed depending on the source location where virtual machines are running and target location where the virtual machines will be replicated to.

- Ensure that all IP ranges corresponding to the source location are whitelisted. You can get the IP ranges [here](https://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiax5XFqffTAhUERo8KHc-HB8AQFggoMAE&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-in%2Fdownload%2Fdetails.aspx%3Fid%3D41653&usg=AFQjCNF0PQrMilyQDTjmj336PUiOhiViIw). This is required so that data can be written to the cache storage account form the VM.

- Ensure that all IP ranges corresponding to Office 365 [authentication and identity IP V4 endpoints listed here](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Office-365-URLs-and-IP-address-ranges-8548a211-3fe7-47cb-abb1-355ea5aa88a2#bkmk_identity) are whitelisted.

- Ensure that you whitelist the below IPs ranges depending on your target location.

**Target Location** | **Site recovery service IPs** |  **Site recovery monitoring IP**

## Network Security Group configuration

If you are using Network Security Group (NSG) rules to control outbound connectivity, you need to ensure the "Allow HTTP outbound" rules for all the IP ranges mentioned above.

For example, if your VM's source location is 'East US' and your replication is target location is 'Central US', you need to create NSG rules for below IP ranges.

### NSG rules on 'East US' NSG

1. Create rules corresponding to 'East US' IP ranges. You can get the IP ranges [here](https://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiax5XFqffTAhUERo8KHc-HB8AQFggoMAE&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-in%2Fdownload%2Fdetails.aspx%3Fid%3D41653&usg=AFQjCNF0PQrMilyQDTjmj336PUiOhiViIw). This is required so that data can be written to the cache storage account form the VM.

2. Create rules for all IP ranges corresponding to Office 365 [authentication and identity IP V4 endpoints listed here](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Office-365-URLs-and-IP-address-ranges-8548a211-3fe7-47cb-abb1-355ea5aa88a2#bkmk_identity).

3. Create rules corresponding to target location.

**Location** | **Site recovery service IPs** |  **Site recovery monitoring IP**
 --- | --- | ---
Central US | 40.69.144.231</br>40.69.167.116 | 52.165.34.144

### NSG rules on 'Central US' NSG

These rules are required so that replication can be enabled from target region to source region post failover.

1. Create rules corresponding to 'Central US' IP ranges. You can get the IP ranges [here](https://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=2&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0ahUKEwiax5XFqffTAhUERo8KHc-HB8AQFggoMAE&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.microsoft.com%2Fen-in%2Fdownload%2Fdetails.aspx%3Fid%3D41653&usg=AFQjCNF0PQrMilyQDTjmj336PUiOhiViIw). This is required so that data can be written to the cache storage account form the VM.

2. Create rules for all IP ranges corresponding to Office 365 [authentication and identity IP V4 endpoints listed here](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/Office-365-URLs-and-IP-address-ranges-8548a211-3fe7-47cb-abb1-355ea5aa88a2#bkmk_identity).

3. Create rules corresponding to source location.

**Location** | **Site recovery service IPs** |  **Site recovery monitoring IP**
 --- | --- | ---
East US | 13.82.88.226</br>40.71.38.173 | 104.45.147.24

## Proxy configuration

If you are using any proxy to control outbound connectivity, ensure all the [URLs mentioned](#URLs) here are whitelisted.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
> If you are using authenticated proxy, it is not supported.

## Azure to on-premises ExpressRoute configuration

If you have an ExpressRoute connection between on-premises and source location in Azure, follow the below configuration guidance

### Forced tunneling configuration

A common customer configuration is to define their own default route (0.0.0.0/0) which forces outbound internet traffic to instead flow on-premises. This is not ideal as the replication traffic and Site Recovery service communication should not leave Azure boundary. The solution is to define user-defined routes (UDRs) for [IP ranges mentioned here](#IP-ranges) so that they will be honored instead of the default route.

### Connectivity from target location to on-premises

- If your application needs to connect to the on-premises machines, ensure that you have at least ['Site-to-Site' connection](../vpn-gateway/vpn-gateway-howto-site-to-site-resource-manager-portal.md) between your target Azure region and on-premises datacenter. If a lot of traffic is expected to flow between your target Azure region and on-premises datacenter, then you should have another [ExpressRoute connection](../expressroute/expressroute-introduction.md) between target Azure region and on-premises datacenter pre created.

- If you want to retain the same IP ranges and IP values in the target region, ensure you keep the target region 'Site-to-Site'/'ExpressRoute' connection in a disconnected state. This is to make sure there is no IP range clash between the source region's IP ranges and target region IP ranges
