## Overview

Microsoft Azure StorSimple is a hybrid cloud storage solution that addresses the complexities of exponential data growth. This solution uses an Azure storage account as an extension of the on-premises solution and automatically tiers data across on-premises storage and the cloud storage.

This article discusses StorSimple integration with Veritas Backup Exec and the best practices for integrating both the solutions. We also present recommendations on how to configure Veritas Backup Exec to best integrate with StorSimple. We defer to Veritas best practices, backup architects, and administrators on how to best configure Veritas Backup Exec to meet your backup requirements and SLAs.

This article illustrates configuration steps and key concepts but is by no means a step-by-step configuration or installation guide. The artice assumes that the basic components and infrastructure are in working order and ready to support the concepts that we describe.

## Why StorSimple as a backup target?

StorSimple is a great backup target for the following reasons:

-   It provides standard local storage for backup applications to use without any changes to provide a fast backup destination. StorSimple is also available for quick restore of recent backups.

-   Its cloud tiering is seamlessly integrated with a cloud storage account to use cost-effective Microsoft Azure storage.

-   It automatically provides offsite storage for disaster recovery.


## Target audience

The audience for this paper includes backup administrators, storage administrators, and storage architects with knowledge of storage, Windows Server 2012 R2, Ethernet, cloud services, and Veritas Backup Exec.

## Supported versions

For a complete list of supported versions, go to:

-   [Backup Exec versions 15 and above](http://backupexec.com/compatibility).

-   [StorSimple Update 3 and above](storsimple-overview.md#storsimple-workload-summary).

## Key concepts

As with any other storage solution, a careful assessment of the solution’s storage performance, SLAs, rate of change, and capacity growth needs is critical to success. The main idea is that by introducing a cloud tier, your access times and throughputs to the cloud play a fundamental role in the ability of StorSimple to do its job.

StorSimple is designed to provide storage to applications that operate on a well-defined working set of data (hot data). In this model, the working set of data is stored on the local tiers, and the remaining non-working/cold/archived set of data is tiered to the cloud. This model is represented in the following figure. The nearly flat green line represents the data stored on the local tiers of the StorSimple device. The red line represents the total amount of data stored on the StorSimple solution across all the tiers. The space between the flat green line and the exponential red curve represents the total amount of data stored in the cloud.

**StorSimple tiering**
![Storsimple tiering diagram](./media/storsimple-configure-backup-target-using-backup-exec/image1.jpg)

With this architecture in mind, you’ll find that StorSimple is ideally suited to operate as a backup target. StorSimple lets you:

-   Perform most frequent restores from the local working set of data.

-   Use the cloud for offsite disaster recovery and older data where restores are less frequent.

## StorSimple benefits

StorSimple provides an on-premises solution that is seamlessly integrated with Microsoft Azure, by taking advantage of seamless access to on-premises and cloud storage.

StorSimple uses automatic tiering between the on-premises device, which contains solid-state device (SSD) and serial-attached SCSI (SAS) storage, and Azure Storage. Automatic tiering keeps frequently accessed data local, on the SSD and SAS tiers, and it moves infrequently accessed data to Azure Storage.

StorSimple offers the following benefits:

-   Unique deduplication and compression algorithms that leverage the cloud to achieve unprecedented deduplication levels

-   High availability

-   Geo-replication by leveraging Azure geo-replication

-   Azure integration

-   Data encryption in the cloud

-   Improved disaster recovery and compliance

Although StorSimple presents two main deployment scenarios (primary and secondary backup target), keep in mind that it is fundamentally a plain block storage device. StorSimple does all the compression and deduplication, and it sends and retrieves data from the cloud seamlessly to both the application and the file system.

For more information about StorSimple, see [StorSimple 8000 series: hybrid cloud storage solution](storsimple-overview.md) and review the [technical StorSimple 8000 series specifications](storsimple-technical-specifications-and-compliance.md).

> [IMPORTANT!] StorSimple device as backup target is only supported with StorSimple 8000 Update 3 or later.

## Architecture overview

The following tables contain the device model-to-architecture initial guidance.

#### StorSimple capacities for local and cloud storage

| Local storage capacity | &lt; 10 TiB\*  | &lt; 20 TiB\*  |
| Cloud storage capacity | &gt; 200 TiB\* | &gt; 500 TiB\* |

\* Storage size assumes no deduplication or compression.

#### StorSimple capacities for primary and secondary backups


| Backup scenario  | Local storage capacity                                         | Cloud storage capacity                      |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Primary backup   | Recent backups stored on local storage for fast recovery (RPO) | Backup history (RPO) fits in cloud capacity |
| Secondary backup | Secondary copy of backup data can be stored in cloud capacity  |

## StorSimple as a primary backup target

In this scenario, the StorSimple volumes are presented to the backup application as the sole repository for backups. The following figure illustrates the solution architecture were all the backups use StorSimple tiered volumes for both backups and restores.

![StorSimple as a primary backup target logical diagram](./media/storsimple-configure-backup-target-using-backup-exec/primarybackuptargetlogicaldiagram.png)

### Primary target backup logical steps

1.  Backup server contacts the target backup agent(s) and backup agents transmit data to backup server.

2.  Backup server writes data to StorSimple tiered volumes.

3.  Backup server updates catalog database and completes the backup job.

4.  Snapshot script triggers the StorSimple cloud snapshot management (start-delete).

5.  Based on a retention policy, the backup server deletes the expired backups.

###  Primary target restore logical steps

1.  Backup server starts restoring the appropriate data from the storage repository.

2.  Backup agent receives the data from Backup server.

3.  Backup server completes the restore job.

## StorSimple as a secondary backup target

In this scenario, the StorSimple volumes are primarily used for mostly long term retention or archiving.

The following figure illustrates the architecture where the initial backups and restores target a high-performance volume, and then at a given schedule will be copied and archived to a StorSimple tiered volume.

It is important to size your high-performance volume with ample space and performance to handle the retention policy capacity and performance requirements.

![StorSimple as a secondary backup target logical diagram](./media/storsimple-configure-backup-target-using-backup-exec/secondarybackuptargetlogicaldiagram.png)

### Secondary target backup logical steps

1.  Backup server contacts the target backup agent(s) and backup agents transmit data to backup server.

2.  Backup server writes data to high performance storage.

3.  Backup server updates catalog database and completes the backup job.

4.  Based on a retention policy the backup server copies backups to StorSimple.

5.  Snapshot script triggers StorSimple cloud snapshot management (start-delete).

6.  Based on a retention policy, the backup server deletes the expired backups.

### Secondary target restore logical steps

1.  Backup server starts restoring the appropriate data from the storage repository.

2.  Backup agent receives the data from backup server.

3.  Backup server completes the restore job.

## Deploy the solution

The deployment of this solution consists of three steps: preparing the network infrastructure, deploying your StorSimple device as a backup target, and finally deploying the Veritas Backup Exec. Each of these steps is discussed in detail in the following sections.

### Configure the network 

StorSimple as an integrated solution with the Azure cloud requires an active and working connection to the Azure cloud. This connection is used for the various operations such as management, transferring metadata, tiering older and less accessed data to the Azure cloud storage, and cloud snapshots.

For the solution to perform optimally, we recommend that you adhere to the following networking best practices:

-   The link that connects the StorSimple tiering to Azure must meet your bandwidth requirements by applying the proper the Quality of Service (QoS) to your infrastructure switches to match your RPO/RTO SLAs.

-   The maximum Azure Blob Storage access latencies should be in the 80 ms range.

### Deploy StorSimple

For a step-by-step StorSimple deployment guidance, go to [Deploy your on-premises StorSimple device](storsimple-deployment-walkthrough-u2.md).

### Deploy Veritas Backup Exec

For Veritas Backup Exec installation best practices, go to [Best practices for Backup Exec installation](https://www.veritas.com/support/en_US/article.000068207).

## Configure the solution

## Best practices for StorSimple and Veritas Backup Exec

The following list is a list of basic configuration settings to better integrate StorSimple and Veritas Backup Exec. Refer to the Veritas Backup Exec documentation for the latest Veritas Backup Exec settings and best practices on how to implement these requirements by visiting [www.veritas.com](https://www.veritas.com).

### Operating system

-   Windows Server encryption and deduplication for the NTFS File System should be disabled.

-   Windows Server defragmentation should be disabled on the StorSimple volumes.

-   Windows Server indexing should be disabled on the StorSimple volumes.

-   Antivirus scanning should be done at the source host and not run against the StorSimple volumes.

-   The default [Windows Server maintenance](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/hh848037.aspx) in task manager must be disabled.

    - Disable Maintenance configurator in Windows Task Scheduler.

        Or

    - Download: [PSEXEC – Microsoft Sysinternals](https://technet.microsoft.com/sysinternals/bb897553.aspx)

      - After downloading PSEXEC, run Windows PowerShell as an administrator, and type:
            
            `psexec \\%computername% -s schtasks /change /tn “MicrosoftWindowsTaskSchedulerMaintenance Configurator" /disable`

### StorSimple

-   Ensure the StorSimple adevice is updated to [Update 3 or later](storsimple-install-update-3.md).

-   iSCSI connections and resources should be isolated and dedicated to iSCSI and not shared for backup or other network traffic.

-   The StorSimple device must be a dedicated backup target. Mixed workloads are not supported as these impact your RTO/RPO.

### Veritas Backup Exec

-   Veritas Backup Exec must be installed on a local drive of the server and not on a StorSimple volume.

-   Set the Veritas Backup Exec Storage **concurrent write operations** to the maximum allowed.

    -   Veritas Backup Exec Storage **block and buffer size** should be set at 512 KB.

    -   Veritas Backup Exec Storage **buffered read and write** should be enabled.

-   Veritas Backup Exec full and incremental backups are supported while synthetic and differential backups are not recommended.

-   Backup data files should only contain data for a specific job. For example, no media appends across different jobs are allowed.

-   Veritas Backup Exec job verification should be disabled. If required, verification should be done right after the backup job. It is important to understand that this will affect your backup window.

-   In the **Storage > Your disk > Details > Properties**, disable **Pre-allocate disk space**.

## Retention policies

One of the most used backup retention policies is the Grandfather, Father and Son (GFS). An Incremental backup is performed daily, and full backups are done weekly and monthly. In this case, we would have 6 StorSimple Tiered Volumes.

-   One volume will contain the weekly, monthly, and yearly full backups.

-   The other 5 StorSimple tiered volumes will be used for storing daily incremental backups.

In the example below, we are using a GFS rotation assuming the following:

-   Non-deduped or compressed data

-   Full backups are 1 TiB

-   Daily incremental backups are 500GiB each.

-   4 weekly backups kept for a month

-   12 monthly backups kept for a year

-   1 yearly backup kept for 10 years

Given the previous assumptions, you will create a 26 TiB StorSimple tiered volume for the monthly and yearly full backups. You will also create a 5 TiB StorSimple tiered volume for each of the incremental daily backups.

| Backup type retention | Size TiB | GFS multiplier\*                                       | Total capacity TiB          |
|-----------------------|----------|--------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
| Weekly full           | 1        | 4                                                      | 4                           |
| Daily incremental     | 0.5      | 20 “cycles are equal to the number of weeks per month” | 12 (2 for additional quota) |
| Monthly full          | 1        | 12                                                     | 12                          |
| Yearly full           | 1        | 10                                                     | 10                          |
| GFS requirement       |          |                                                        | 38                          |
| Additional quota      | 4        |                                                        | 42 total GFS requirement   |

\*The GFS multiplier is the number of copies you need to protect and keep to meet your backup policies.

1.  Configure your full and incremental backups so that they meet your RPO/RTO requirements and conform to the Veritas best practices.

2.  On the Backup Options window, select **Storage**.

    ![Backup options storage tab](./media/storsimple-configure-backup-target-using-backup-exec/image16.png)

1.  Assign corresponding StorSimple volumes to your backup schedule.

    > [!NOTE] **Compression** and **Encryption type** are set to **None**.

2.  Under **Verify**, select the **Do not verify data for this job** as this may affect StorSimple tiering.

    > [!NOTE] Defragmentation, indexing, and background verification negatively affects the StorSimple tiering.

    ![Backup Options verify settings](./media/storsimple-configure-backup-target-using-backup-exec/image17.png)

1.  After you have configured the rest of your backup options to meet your requirements, select **OK** to finish.

## StorSimple as a secondary backup target

> [!NOTE] Be aware that if you need to restore data from a backup that has been tiered to the cloud, the restore occurs at cloud speeds.

In this model, you must have a storage media (other than StorSimple) to serve as a temporary cache. For example, you could use a RAID volume to acommodate space, IOs, and bandwidth. We recommend using RAID 5, 50 and 10.

In the following figure, we illustrate typical short retention local (to the server) volumes and long term retention archive volumes. In this case, all the backups run on the local (to the server) RAID volume. These backups are periodically duplicated and archived to an archive volume. It is important to size your local (to the server) RAID volume to handle the short term retention capacity and performance requirements.

![Storsimple as secondary backup target logical diagram ](./media/storsimple-configure-backup-target-using-backup-exec/secondarybackuptargetdiagram.png)

The following table illustrates how the backups should be configured to run on the local and StorSimple disks inlcuding the individual and the total capacity requirements.

#### Backup configuration and capacity requirements

| Backup type and retention                    |Configured storage| Size (TiB) | GFS multiplier | Total Capacity (TiB)        |
|----------------------------------------------|-----|----------|----------------|------------------------|
| Week 1 (Full and incremental) |Local disk (short term)| 1        | 1              | 1           |
| StorSimple Week 2-4           |StorSimple disk (long term) | 1        | 4              | 4                   |
| Monthly Full                                 |StorSimple disk (long term) | 1        | 12             | 12                   |
| Yearly Full                               |StorSimple disk (long term) | 1        | 1              | 1                   |
| | |          |                | 18*|

\* the total capacity includes 17 TiB of StorSimple disks and 1 TiB of local RAID volume

### Assign StorSimple volumes to Backup Exec acrhive/deduplication job

1.  Once the initial backup job is configured to use the RAID volume as the primary backup target, go to Veritas Backup Exec management console. Select the job that you want to archive to a StorSimple volume, right-click and select Backup defintion properties. Click **Edit**.

    ![Backup Exec console, backup definitions proterties tab](./media/storsimple-configure-backup-target-using-backup-exec/image19.png)

1.  Select **Add Stage** and from the dropdown list, select **Duplicate to Disk**. Click **Edit**.

    ![Backup Exec console, backup definitions add stage](./media/storsimple-configure-backup-target-using-backup-exec/image20.png)

2.  In the Duplicate Options, select the appropriate **Source** and the **Schedule**.

    ![Backup Exec console, backup definitions proterties, Duplicate Options](./media/storsimple-configure-backup-target-using-backup-exec/image21.png)

1.  From the **Storage** dropdown list, select the StorSimple volume where you want the archive job to store the data. In this case, the source is set to **Full** and target is set to the StorSimple full archive volume.

    ![Backup Exec console, backup definitions proterties, Duplicate Options](./media/storsimple-configure-backup-target-using-backup-exec/image22.png)

1.  Go to **Verify** and select **Do not verify data for this job**.

    ![Backup Exec console, backup definitions proterties, Duplicate Options](./media/storsimple-configure-backup-target-using-backup-exec/image23.png)

1.  Click **OK**.

    ![Backup Exec console, backup definitions proterties, Duplicate Options](./media/storsimple-configure-backup-target-using-backup-exec/image24.png)

1.  In the Backup column, **add a new stage**. Choose the source as Incremental and the target as StorSimple volume where the incremental backup job is archived. Repeat the above steps.

## StorSimple cloud snapshots

StorSimple cloud snapshots protect the data that resides in StorSimple device. This is equivalent to shipping tapes to an offsite facility and if using Azure geo-redundant storage (GRS), as shipping tapes to multiple sites. If a device restore was needed in case of a disaster, you could bring another StorSimple device online and do a failover. Following the failover, you would be able to access the data (at cloud speeds) from the most recent cloud snapshot.

The following section illustrates how to create a short script to trigger and delete StorSimple cloud snapshots during backup post-processing. 

> [!NOTE] Snapshots that are manually or programmatically created do not follow the StorSimple snapshot expiration policy. These must be manually or programmatically deleted.

### Start and delete cloud snapshots with a script

> [!NOTE] Carefully assess the compliance and data retention repercussions before you delete a StorSimple snapshot. For more information on how to run a post-backup script, refer to Veritas Backup Exec documentation.

#### Backup lifecycle

![Backup Lifecycle diagram](./media/storsimple-configure-backup-target-using-backup-exec/backuplifecycle.png)

#### Requirements:

-   The server that will run the script must have access to Azure cloud.

-   The user account must have the necessary permissions.

-   A StorSimple Backup Policy with the associated StorSimple Volumes configured but not enabled.

-   StorSimple Resource Name, Registration Key, Device Name and Backup policy ID.

#### Steps:

1.  [Install Azure PowerShell](/powershell-install-configure/).

2.  [Download and import publish Settings and subscription information.](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn385850.aspx)

3.  In the Azure classic portal, get the resource name and [registration key for your StorSimple Manager service](storsimple-deployment-walkthrough/#step-2:-get-the-service-registration-key).

4.  On the server that will run the script, run Windows PowerShell as Administrator. Type:

    -   `Get-AzureStorSimpleDeviceBackupPolicy –DeviceName <device name>`

    Make a note of the Backup Policy ID.

5.  In Notepad, create a new Windows PowerShell Script and save it in the same location where you saved the Azure publish settings. For example, `C:\\CloudSnapshot\\StorSimpleCloudSnapshot.ps1`.

    Copy and paste the following code snippet:

        ````
        Import-AzurePublishSettingsFile "c:\\CloudSnapshot Snapshot\\myAzureSettings.publishsettings"
        Disable-AzureDataCollection
        $ApplianceName = <myStorSimpleApplianceName>
        $RetentionInDays = 20
        $RetentionInDays = -$RetentionInDays
        $Today = Get-Date
        $ExpirationDate = $Today.AddDays($RetentionInDays)
        Select-AzureStorSimpleResource -ResourceName "myResource" –RegistrationKey
        Start-AzureStorSimpleDeviceBackupJob –DeviceName $ApplianceName -BackupType CloudSnapshot -BackupPolicyId <BackupId> -Verbose
        $CompletedSnapshots =@()
        $CompletedSnapshots = Get-AzureStorSimpleDeviceBackup -DeviceName $ApplianceName
        Write-Host "The Expiration date is " $ExpirationDate
        Write-Host

        ForEach ($SnapShot in $CompletedSnapshots)
        {
            $SnapshotStartTimeStamp = $Snapshot.CreatedOn
            if ($SnapshotStartTimeStamp -lt $ExpirationDate)

            {
                $SnapShotInstanceID = $SnapShot.InstanceId
                Write-Host "This snpashotdate was created on " $SnapshotStartTimeStamp.Date.ToShortDateString()
                Write-Host "Instance ID " $SnapShotInstanceID
                Write-Host "This snpashotdate is older and needs to be deleted"
                Write-host "\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#\#"
                Remove-AzureStorSimpleDeviceBackup -DeviceName $ApplianceName -BackupId $SnapShotInstanceID -Force -Verbose
            }
        }
        
        ````

1.  Add the script to your backup job in Veritas Backup Exec, by editing your Veritas Backup Exec job options pre-post commands

    ![Backup Exec console, backup options, Pre/post commands tab](./media/storsimple-configure-backup-target-using-backup-exec/image25.png)

> [!NOTE] We recommend that you run your StorSimple cloud snapshot backup policy at the end of your daily backup job as a post process script. For more information on how to backup and restore your backup application environment to meet your RPO/RTO, consult your backup architect.

## StorSimple as a restore source

Restores from a StorSimple work similar to restores from any block storage device. When restoring data that is tiered to the cloud, restores occur at cloud speeds. For local date, restores occur at local disk speed of the device. For information on how to perform a restore, refer to Veritas Backup Exec documentation, and conform to Veritas Backup Exec restore best practices.

## StorSimple failover and disaster recovery

> [!NOTE] For backup target scenarios, StorSimple Cloud Appliance is not supported as a restore target.

A disaster could occur due to various factors. The following table lists common disaster recovery (DR) scenarios.
