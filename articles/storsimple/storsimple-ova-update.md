# Apply updates and hotfixes to the StorSimple Virtual Array

## Overview

You may need to apply software updates or hotfixes to keep your StorSimple Virtual Array up-to-date. In general, we recommend that you install updates through the Azure classic portal. However, in instances where the portal is not available, you can use the local web UI to apply hotfixes or updates. This tutorial describes how to use the Azure classic portal or the local web UI to apply an update or hotfix.

Keep in mind that an update or hotfix installation could restart your device. Given that the StorSimple Virtual Array is a single node device, any IOs that were in progress will be disrupted and your device will have some down time. We also recommend that prior to applying an update, take the volumes or shares offline on the host first and then the device. This will minimize any possibility of data corruption.

## Use the Azure classic portal

We recommend that you install updates through the Azure classic portal. Perform the following steps to install the update or hotfix.

#### To install updates via the Azure classic portal

3. To check for updates, click **Scan Updates** at the bottom of the page.

4. You will see a message if software updates are available. Click **Download Updates** to download the updates. This should launch a job to download the available updates. The install  Click **Install Updates** to begin updating the device.

    You will be notified when the update is successfully installed. The software version and the timestamp should also be updated.
