It empowers the customers to take advantage of economical cloud storage for the inactive data, while keeping their mission-critical data on-premises for the highest levels of performance. 

StorSimple in CSP enables partners to capitalize on this opportunity. The partners own the end-to-end customer lifecycle with direct provisioning, billing, and support of Microsoft’s cloud services. In short, the partners can  now transact the StorSimple along with their services to customers.
