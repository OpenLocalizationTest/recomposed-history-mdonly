## Overview

Microsoft Azure StorSimple is a unique approach to enterprise storage with true hybrid cloud storage capabilities. It empowers the customers to take advantage of economical cloud storage for the inactive data, while keeping their mission-critical data on-premises for the highest levels of performance. 

StorSimple in CSP enables partners to capitalize on this opportunity. The partners own the end-to-end customer lifecycle with direct provisioning, billing, and support of Microsoftâ€™s cloud services. In short, the partners can  now transact the StorSimple along with their services to customers.

For more information about StorSimple in CSP, visit the [Partner center](http://partnercenter.microsoft.com/).
For more information on billing, pricing, incentives, and getting support in CSP, go to [StorSimple in CSP: FAQ](storsimple-partner-csp-faq.md). 

## Deploy and manage StorSimple in CSP

StorSimple in CSP is available as a seat license service in all the countries where the CSP exists and the StorSimple Device Manager is available. StorSimple in CSP uses the Azure portal and the StorSimple Device Manager service. A CSP partner can create a StorSimple Device Manager to manage StorSimple Virtual Arrays, shares, volumes, and backups. You can administer all virtual arrays registered to your StorSimple Device Manager service via the Azure portal.

For more information, go to [Deploy and manage your StorSimple Virtual Array in the CSP](storsimple-partner-csp-sva-deploy.md).
