## Overview

StorSimple Virtual Array can be deployed by the Cloud Solution Provider (CSP) partners for their customers. A CSP partner can create a StorSimple Device Manager service. This service can then be used to deploy and manage StorSimple Virtual Array and the associated shares, volumes, and backups.

This article describes how to deploy a StorSimple Virtual Array in CSP.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that:

- You are enrolled under the CSP program.
- You have valid [Partner Center](http://partnercenter.microsoft.com/) login credentials. The credentials enable you to sign into the Partner portal to add new customers, search for customers, or navigate to a customer account from the Partner dashboard. The CSP can function as a StorSimple administrator on behalf of the customer in the Azure portal.
                             
## Add customers

Perform the following steps to add a customer to the StorSimple subscription.

1. Go to the [Partner Center](http://partnercenter.microsoft.com/) and sign in using your CSP credentials. Click **Dashboard**.
