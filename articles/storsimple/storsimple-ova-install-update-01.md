# Apply updates and hotfixes to the StorSimple Virtual Array

## Overview

You may need to apply software updates or hotfixes to keep your StorSimple Virtual Array up-to-date. In general, we recommend that you install updates through the Azure classic portal. However, in instances where the portal is not available, you can use the local web UI to apply hotfixes or updates. This tutorial describes how to use the Azure classic portal or the local web UI to apply an update or hotfix.

Keep in mind that an update or hotfix installation could restart your device. Given that the StorSimple Virtual Array is a single node device, any IO that were in progress will be disrupted and your device will have some downtime. We also recommend that prior to applying an update, take the volumes or shares offline on the host first and then the device. This will minimize any possibility of data corruption.

## Use the Azure classic portal

We recommend that you install updates through the Azure classic portal. The portal procedure requires the user to scan, download, and then install the updates. Perform the following steps to install the update or hotfix.

#### To install updates via the Azure classic portal

1. On the **Devices** page, select the device on which you want to install updates.

2. Navigate to **Devices** > **Maintenance** >**Software Updates**.

3. You will see a message if the software updates are available. To check for updates, you can also click **Scan Updates** at the bottom of the page.

4. From the bottom of the page, click **Download Updates**. A dialog is presented to you notifying that the update is disruptive. Given the StorSimple Virtual Array is a single node device, after the update is applied, the device will restart thereby disrupting any IO in progress. Click the check icon to launch a job to download the available updates. You will be notified after the updates are downloaded.

5. From the bottom of the page, click **Install Updates** to begin updating the device. The dialog will be presented to you again. Click the check icon to start a job to install the updates. You will be notified after the job is created.

## Use the local web UI 

Use the local web UI to apply updates when the Azure classic portal is not available. There are two steps when using the local web UI:

- Download update or hotfix
- Install update or hotfix

### Download update or hotfix

Perform the following steps to download the software update from the Microsoft Update Catalog.

#### To download update or hotfix

1. Start Internet Explorer and navigate to [http://catalog.update.microsoft.com](http://catalog.update.microsoft.com).

2. If this is your first time using the Microsoft Update Catalog on this computer, click **Install** when prompted to install the Microsoft Update Catalog add-on.

3. In the search box of the Microsoft Update Catalog, enter the Knowledge Base (KB) number of the hotfix you want to download, for example **3160441**, and then click **Search**.

    The hotfix listing appears, for example, **Cumulative Software Bundle Update 0.1 for StorSimple Virtual Array**.

4. Click **Add**. The update is added to the basket.

5. Click **View Basket**.

6. Click **Download**. Specify or **Browse** to a local location where you want the downloads to appear. The updates are downloaded to the specified location and placed in a subfolder with the same name as the update. The folder can also be copied to a network share that is reachable from the device.


### Install update or hotfix

Prior to the update or hotfix installation, make sure that you have the update or the hotfix downloaded either locally on your host or accessible via a network share. Perform the following steps to install the update or hotfix.

#### To install update or hotfix

1. In the local web UI, go to **Maintenance** > **Software Update**.

2. In **Update file path**, enter the file name for the update or the hotfix. You can also browse to the update or hotfix installation file if placed on a network share. Click **Apply**.
