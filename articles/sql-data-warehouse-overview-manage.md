# Management Tools for SQL Data Warehouse
This topic explores and compares tools and options for managing SQL Data Warehouses (SQL DW) so you can pick the right tool for the job, your business and you. Choosing the right tool depends on how many databases you manage, the task, and how often a task is performed.

## Azure Portal
The Azure Portal is a web-based management portal where you can create, update, and delete Azure SQL Data Warehouses and monitor database resources. This tool is great is if you're just getting started with Azure, managing a small number of data warehouses, or need to quickly do something. 


## SQL Server Data Tools in Visual Studio
SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT) in Visual Studio is a client tool that runs on your computer and allows you to connect to, manage, and develop your database in the cloud. If you're an application developer familiar with Visual Studio or other integrated development environments (IDEs), try using SSDT in Visual Studio.


##SQL Server Management Studio
SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) is a client tool that runs on your computer and allows you to connect to, manage, and develop your database in the cloud. SQL Data Warehouse does not currently support SSMS, but SSMS does not offer any functionality beyond what SSDT offers. 

##Command-line tools
You can use command line tools such as PowerShell or sqlcmd to manage Azure SQL Data Warehouses and automate Azure resource deployments. Microsoft recommends these tools for managing a large number of Azure SQL Data Warehouses and deploying resource changes in a production environment.
