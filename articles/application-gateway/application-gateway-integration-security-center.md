# Application Gateway integration with Security Center

Application Gateway provides application delivery control (ADC) features on layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS).  Included in these capabilities is a web application firewall (WAF).  WAF protects backend web applications against common exploits and vulnerabilities. Azure Security Center provides insights into your Azure services and gives guidance on the best ways to protect your resources.
