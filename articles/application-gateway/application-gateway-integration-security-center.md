# Application Gateway integration with Security Center

Application Gateway provides application delivery control (ADC) features on layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS).  Included in these capabilities is a web application firewall (WAF).  WAF protects backend web applications against common exploits and vulnerabilities. Application gateway integrates with Azure Security Center. Azure Security Center provides insights into your Azure services and gives guidance on the best ways to protect your resources.  

## Overview

Application Gateway WAF is a recommendation in Security Center for a web application firewall. Web enabled resources show in the security center as high severity recommendations if they are not protected by a WAF. Recommendations for web application firewalls are shown on the **Overview** page, under **Applications**.

Clicking any recommendations regarding web application firewall opens a new blade showing the details of the recommendation.

If the resources are behind an application gateway, at this point you need to [enable the web application firewall on the application gateway](application-gateway-web-application-firewall-portal.md#add-web-application-firewall-to-an-existing-application-gateway). This action closes the recommendation.
