# Customize web application firewall rules through the Azure CLI 2.0

Application Gateway web application firewall provides protection for web applications. These protections are provided by OWASP CRS rulesets. Some rules can cause false positives and block real traffic.  For this reason application gateway provides the capability to customize rulegroups and rules on a web application firewall enabled application gateway. For more information on the specific rule groups and rules, visit [web application firewall CRS Rule groups and rules](application-gateway-crs-rulegroups-rules.md)

## View rule groups and rules

The following are examples show how to view rules and rule groups that are configurable on a WAF enabled application gateway.

### View rule groups

```azurecli
az network application-gateway waf-config list-rule-sets --type OWASP
```

The following a truncated response from the preceding example.

```
[
  {
    "id": "/subscriptions//resourceGroups//providers/Microsoft.Network/applicationGatewayAvailableWafRuleSets/",
    "location": null,
    "name": "OWASP_3.0",
    "provisioningState": "Succeeded",
    "resourceGroup": "",
    "ruleGroups": [
      {
        "description": "",
        "ruleGroupName": "REQUEST-910-IP-REPUTATION",
        "rules": null
      },
      ...
    ],
    "ruleSetType": "OWASP",
    "ruleSetVersion": "3.0",
    "tags": null,
    "type": "Microsoft.Network/applicationGatewayAvailableWafRuleSets"
  },
  {
    "id": "/subscriptions//resourceGroups//providers/Microsoft.Network/applicationGatewayAvailableWafRuleSets/",
    "location": null,
    "name": "OWASP_2.2.9",
    "provisioningState": "Succeeded",
    "resourceGroup": "",
   "ruleGroups": [
      {
        "description": "",
        "ruleGroupName": "crs_20_protocol_violations",
        "rules": null
      },
      ...
    ],
    "ruleSetType": "OWASP",
    "ruleSetVersion": "2.2.9",
    "tags": null,
    "type": "Microsoft.Network/applicationGatewayAvailableWafRuleSets"
  }
]
```

### View rules in a rule group

The following example shows how to view rules in a specified rule group.

```azurecli
az network application-gateway waf-config list-rule-sets --group "REQUEST-910-IP-REPUTATION"
```

The following is a truncated response from the preceding example.

```
[
  {
    "id": "/subscriptions//resourceGroups//providers/Microsoft.Network/applicationGatewayAvailableWafRuleSets/",
    "location": null,
    "name": "OWASP_3.0",
    "provisioningState": "Succeeded",
    "resourceGroup": "",
    "ruleGroups": [
      {
        "description": "",
        "ruleGroupName": "REQUEST-910-IP-REPUTATION",
        "rules": [
          {
            "description": "Rule 910011",
            "ruleId": 910011
          },
          ...
        ]
      }
    ],
    "ruleSetType": "OWASP",
    "ruleSetVersion": "3.0",
    "tags": null,
    "type": "Microsoft.Network/applicationGatewayAvailableWafRuleSets"
  }
]
```

## Disable rules

The following example disables rules `910018` and `910017` on an application gateway.

```azurecli
az network application-gateway waf-config set --resource-group AdatumAppGatewayRG --gateway-name AdatumAppGateway --enabled true --rule-set-version 3.0 --disabled-rules 910018 910017
```
