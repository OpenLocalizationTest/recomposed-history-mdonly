# Get stated with Microsoft Power BI Embedded sample code

Here are some resources to help you get started using Microsoft Power BI Embedded preview

-	Sample code
-	API docs
-	SDKs (available via NuGet)

Let’s take a high level look at the steps involved to get started with the sample applications.

> [AZURE.NOTE] Before starting, make sure that you have created at least one Workspace Collection in your Azure subscription. To learn how to create a Workspace Collection in the Azure Portal see "Getting Started with Power BI Embedded Preview" #TODO: Add link

## Setup & Samples

The following will walk you through setting up your Visual Studio development environment to access the Preview components

1.	Download and unzip the powerbi-private-preview-sample-feb26.zip file.
2.	Open **PowerBIPrivatePreview.sln** in Visual Studio.
3.	Build solution.
4.	Run ProvisionSample console app.

    b.	Enter your subscription id, workspace collection and signing key when prompted (These can be found in the Azure portal).

    c.	Copy and save the newly created workspace id to use later (this can also be found in the Azure portal after it is created).

    d.	Import a PBIX file using option 6.

      - If prompted, provide the friendly name for your DataSet.

      - You should see a response like:

          - Checking import state... Publishing
          - Checking import state... Succeeded

  e.	If your PBIX file contains any direct query connections run option 7 to update the connection strings.

  f.	Select option 8 to retrieve the Embed URL that you should use to add the report to your application.

5.	Open the web.config in the paas-demo web application within the same solution.

  a.	Add your signing key, workspace collection name and workspace ID to the appSettings section.

6.	Run the paas-demo web application.

  a.	Left nav should contain a “Reports” menu.

  b.	Click the Report (should match name of imported PBIX).

  c.	Report should now render within the main portion of the app window.
