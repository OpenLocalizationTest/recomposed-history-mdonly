# Common Microsoft Power BI Embedded scenarios

**Microsoft Power BI Embedded** Preview is primarily focused on exposing the majority of existing Power BI API functionality  as part of an Azure service for you to develop your applications with.  Additionally, you will be able to programmatically provision, develop and deploy the necessary resources and Power BI content. See [Get started sample](power-bi-embedded-get-started.md). The following is a list of what's available in preview:

-	Independent Software vendors and customers building customer facing applications can use the **Power BI Embedded** service, and the Power BI SDK, to embed interactive reports. To learn how, see [Get stated with Microsoft Power BI Embedded preview](power-bi-embedded-get-started.md).
-	Fully interactive reports that were authored in the Power BI desktop can be embedded within your own application using a new application token authentication model.
-	Use interactive custom data visualizations in your application. As a developer, you can use the Power BI Visualization Framework to create custom visualizations. See [Extend Power BI with custom visuals](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/custom-visuals/).
-	Always up-to-date interactive reporting inside applications. With **Power BI Embedded**, you can create your own real-time dashboard that has interactive Power BI reports. As an ISV, this gives your customers up-to-date insights from devices, sensors and applications.
-	Use Azure Management (ARM) APIs to programmatically provision **Power BI Workspace Collections** within your Azure subscription. Using the Azure Portal, it's easy to create and manage a **Workspace** including retrieving API keys.
-	Use the **Power BI API** to create and manage Power BI content workspaces. With the API, you can
  - Import a Power BI desktop file (PBIX) into a workspace using key based authentication.
  - Modify connection strings of a dataset.
  - Get **Reports** to integrate into your own app.
  - Set credentials for a dataset to be able to talk to the correct source datasource.
  - To learn more about the **Power BI API**, see [Get stated with Microsoft Power BI Embedded preview](power-bi-embedded-get-started.md).
