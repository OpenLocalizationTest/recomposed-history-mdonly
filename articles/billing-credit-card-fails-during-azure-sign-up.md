# Your debit card or credit card is declined at Azure sign up

<<<<<<< HEAD
If your debit card or credit card is declined or not accepted when you sign up for Azure, you might have one of the following issues to fix.
=======
> [AZURE.NOTE] If you are trying to change or remove an existing card, learn how to [manage your payment information](billing-how-to-change-credit-card.md).

> If you need more help at any point in this article, please [contact support](https://portal.azure.com/?#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade) to get your issue resolved quickly.

If your credit card or debit card was declined when you try to sign up for Azure, you might have issues because of one of the reasons below.

- [The accepted credit card and debit card providers vary based on your country, so you may need to use an international card](#credit-or-debit-card-details). In the drop-down list for choosing a credit card, you will only see the options that are valid in the country that you selected.

- [Your credit or debit card information is inaccurate or incomplete](#credit-or-debit-card-details). You must update your payment info to proceed.

- [You're trying to activate a second free trial](#azure-free-trial); the Azure Free Trial offer is limited to one per user.

- You’re using a virtual or prepaid card. Virtual or prepaid credit or debit cards are not accepted as valid payment options.

- Your card might be inactive or blocked. If you are indeed using a valid credit card or debit card, make sure that the card is active and your bank is not blocking online transactions due to its security policies. Contact your bank to resolve this issue.

## Credit or debit card details

Follow the steps below to make sure your credit or debit card information is valid:

- The credit or debit card you’re using should be listed in the drop-down list for the country you choose.

	- In some cases, although you’re paying for Azure services in your local/preferred currency, you are purchasing services through a non-local Microsoft entity and your credit card is being processed by a non-local bank. Please contact your bank or card issuer to confirm if your credit card is enabled for international transactions.

	- See [supported countries and currencies](billing-countries-and-currencies.md).

- The name you enter must exactly match the name printed on the credit/debit card, without any additional symbols/characters.

- The address you enter must exactly match the address that appears on the credit/debit card statement, including street address, city, state, country, and zip/postal code.

- The CVV code you enter must exactly match the code that appears on the back or front of the credit/debit card.

- **The credit card or debit card provider is not accepted for your country.** When you choose a card, you only see the options that are valid in the country that you select. Contact your bank or card issuer to confirm that your credit card is enabled for international transactions. See [supported countries and currencies](billing-countries-and-currencies.md).
- **Your credit or debit card information is inaccurate or incomplete.** The name, address, and CVV code you enter must match exactly what’s printed on the card.
- **You're using a virtual or prepaid card.** Virtual or prepaid credit or debit cards aren't accepted as payment for Azure subscriptions.
- **The card is inactive or blocked.** Contact your bank and make sure that the card is active and not blocked.
- **You're trying to activate a second free trial.** The Azure Free Trial offer is limited to one free trial activation per user. If you already activated a free trial with this credit card or had an Azure subscription that was linked to this credit card, you can’t activate a free trial. Use another Azure plan from [Microsoft Azure Offer Details](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/offer-details/). 
 
After you update your payment information, you can try signing up again.

## Business that doesn't want to pay by card? Set up invoicing

If you represent a business, you can pay for your Azure subscription with invoice payment methods like checks, overnight checks, or wire transfers. You can’t change to another payment option after you’re set up to pay by invoice.

To pay by invoice, see [Azure Billing - How to invoice](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/invoicing/).

## Update your credit card or debit card information

After you sign up, [manage your payment information](billing-how-to-change-credit-card.md) to change or remove a card.
