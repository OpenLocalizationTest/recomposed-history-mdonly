# Advisor High Availability recommendations

Advisor helps you ensure and improve the continuity of your business-critical applications. You can get high availability recommendations by Advisor from the **High Availability** tab of the Advisor dashboard.

## Virtual machines without an availability set

Advisor identifies virtual machines that are not part of an availability set and recommends moving them into an availability set. To provide redundancy to your application, we recommend that you group two or more virtual machines in an availability set. This configuration ensures that during either a planned or unplanned maintenance event, at least one virtual machine is available and meets the Azure virtual machine SLA. You can choose to either create an availability set for the virtual machine or add the virtual machine to an existing availability set.

> [!NOTE]
> If you choose to create an availability set, you must add at least one more virtual machine to that availability set after creating it. We recommend grouping two or more virtual machines in an availability set to ensure that at least one machine is available during an outage.

## Availability sets with a single virtual machine 

Advisor identifies availability sets that contain a single virtual machine and recommends adding one or more virtual machines to it. To provide redundancy to your application, we recommend that you group two or more virtual machines in an availability set. This configuration ensures that during either a planned or unplanned maintenance event, at least one virtual machine is available and meets the Azure virtual machine SLA. You can choose to either create a virtual machine or use an existing virtual machine, and add it to the availability set.

## Virtual machines with Standard Managed Disks

Advisor identifies virtual machines that have Standard Managed Disks and recommends upgrading to Premium Managed Disks.  

Azure Premium Storage delivers high-performance, low-latency disk support for virtual machines that run I/O-intensive workloads. Virtual-machine disks in premium storage accounts store data on solid-state drives (SSDs). For the best performance for your application, we recommend that you migrate any virtual-machine disks that require high I/O operations per second (IOPS) to premium storage. If a disk does not require high IOPS, you can limit costs by maintaining it in a standard storage account. Standard storage stores virtual-machine disk data on hard-disk drives (HDDs) instead of SSDs. You can choose to migrate your virtual-machine disks to Premium Managed Disks, which is supported on most virtual machine SKUs. In some cases, however, if you want to use Premium Managed Disks, you might need to upgrade your virtual-machine SKUs as well.

## Your application gateway is not configured for fault tolerance
To ensure the business continuity of mission-critical applications that are powered by application gateways, Advisor identifies application-gateway instances that are not configured for fault tolerance, and suggests remediation actions that you can take. Advisor identifies medium or large single-instance application gateways, and it recommends adding at least one more instance. It also identifies single- or multi-instance small application gateways and recommends migrating to a medium or large SKU. Advisor recommends these actions to ensure that your application-gateway instances are configured to satisfy the current SLA requirements for these resources.


## Improve the reliability of your availability-set disks
Advisor identifies availability sets where virtual-machine disks are placed in a single storage account, and it recommends migrating to Managed Disks. Virtual-machine disks that are placed in the same storage account are located on the same storage-scale unit, and they are affected by the failure of a single storage-scale unit. By automatically placing disks in different storage scale units, Managed Disks ensures that virtual-machine disks in an availability set are sufficiently isolated from each other. This structure ensures data redundancy by avoiding a single point of failure during an outage.


## Virtual-machine disks that are susceptible to I/O throttling
Advisor identifies virtual machines that are susceptible to disk performance degradation resulting from I/O throttling, and it recommends migrating to Managed Disks. Placing multiple virtual-machine disks that run I/O intensive workloads in the same storage account causes the storage account to reach its scalability limits, which can lead to throttling. Throttling can degrade the overall performance of virtual machines and cause other potential issues. Managed Disks handles storage-account placement for disks behind the scenes, so you are no longer limited by storage-account scalability limits.


## Virtual machines that are not configured for backup
Advisor identifies virtual machines where backup is not enabled, and it recommends enabling backup. Setting up virtual-machine backup ensures the availability of your business-critical data and offers protection against accidental deletion or corruption.

2. In the left pane, click **More services**.
3. In the service menu pane, under **Monitoring and Management**, and then click **Azure Advisor**.  
 The Advisor dashboard is displayed. 

4. On the Advisor dashboard, click the **High Availability** tab, and then select the subscription for which you want to receive recommendations.

> [!NOTE]
> To access Advisor recommendations, you must first **register** your subscription with Advisor. A subscription is registered when a **subscription Owner** launches the Advisor dashboard and clicks on the **Get recommendations** button. This is a **one-time operation**. Once a subscription is registered, Advisor recommendations can be accessed by **Owner**s, **Contributor**s, or **Reader**s for a subscription, resource group or a specific resource.

<--- Manbeen: Adding this version of the note as an alternative. -->
> [!NOTE]
> To access Advisor recommendations, do the following:
1. Register your subscription with Advisor.  
 A subscription is registered when a *subscription Owner* launches the Advisor dashboard and clicks the **Get recommendations** button. This is a *one-time operation*. 
2. After you register your subscription, you can access Advisor recommendations as *Owner*, *Contributor*, or *Reader* for a subscription, a resource group, or a specific resource.
