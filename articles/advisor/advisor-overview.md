# Introduction to Azure Advisor

## What is Azure Advisor?
Azure Advisor is a personalized cloud consultant that helps you follow best practices to optimize your Azure deployments. It analyzes your resource configuration and usage telemetry t. It then recommends solutions to help improve the performance, security, and high availability of your resources while looking for opportunities to reduce your overall Azure spend.

You can access Advisor through the [Azure portal](https://aka.ms/azureadvisordashboard). Sign into the [portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **Browse**, and then scroll to **Azure Advisor**. The Advisor dashboard displays personalized recommendations for a selected subscription. The recommendations are divided into four categories. 

-   **High Availability** – to ensure and improve the continuity of your business-critical applications

-   **Security** – to detect threats and vulnerabilities that could lead to potential security breaches

-   **Performance** – to enhance the speed of your applications

-   **Cost** – to optimize and reduce your overall Azure spend

> [!NOTE]
> Azure Advisor generates recommendations for subscriptions where you are assigned the role of **Owner**, **Contributor** or **Reader**.

You can click a recommendation to learn additional information about it. You can also learn about actions you can perform to take advantage of an opportunity or resolve an issue. 
Advisor offers recommendations with inline actions or documentation links. Clicking an inline action takes you through a “guided user journey” to implement it. Clicking a documentation link points you to the documentation that describes how you can manually implement the action. 

Advisor updates recommendations on an hourly basis. If you don’t intend to take an immediate action on a recommendation, you can snooze it for a time period or dismiss it.
