# Using the Azure CLI for Mac, Linux, and Windows with Azure Resource Management

This topic describes how to use the Azure Command-Line Interface (Azure CLI) in the **arm** mode to create, manage, and delete services on the command line of Mac, Linux, and Windows computers. You can perform the same tasks using the various libraries of the Azure SDKs, with PowerShell, and using the Azure Portal. 

Azure resource management enables you to create a group of resources -- virtual machines, websites, databases, and so on -- as a single deployable unit. You can then deploy, update, or delete all of the resources for your application in a single, coordinated operation. You describe your group resources in a JSON template for deployment and then can use that template for different environments such as testing, staging and production. 

## Imperative and declarative approaches 

As with the [service management mode (**asm**)](virtual-machines-command-line-tools.md), the **arm** mode of the Azure CLI gives you commands that create resources imperatively on the command line. For example, if you type `azure group create <groupname> <location>` you are asking Azure to create a resource group, and with `azure group deployment create <resourcegroup> <deploymentname>` you are instructing Azure to create a deployment of any number of items and place them in a group. Because each type of resource has imperative commands, you can chain them together to create fairly complex deployments. 

However, using resource group _templates_ that describe a resource group is a declarative approach that is far more powerful, allowing you to automate complex deployments of (almost) any number of resources for (almost) any purpose. When using templates, the only imperative command is to deploy one. For a general overview of templates, resources, and resource groups, see [Azure Resource Group Overview](resource-groups-overview).  

> [AZURE.NOTE] In addition to command-specific options documented below and on the command line, there are three options that can be used to view detailed output such as request options and status codes. The -v parameter provides verbose output, and the -vv parameter provides even more detailed verbose output. The --json option will output the result in raw json format, and is very useful for scripting scenarios.
> 
> Usage with the --json switch is very common, and is an important part of both obtaining and understanding results from Azure CLI operations that return resource information, status, and logs and also using templates. You may want to install JSON parser tools such as **jq** or **jsawk** or use your favorite language library.

##Usage requirements

The set-up requirements to use the **arm** mode with the Azure CLI are:

- an Azure account ([get a free trial here](http://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/))
- [installing the Azure CLI](xplat-cli-install.md)
- [configuring the Azure CLI](xplat-cli-connect.md) to use an Azure Active Directory identity or a Service Principal

Once you have an account and have installed the Azure CLI, you must 

- switch to the **arm** mode by typing `azure config mode arm`. 
- Log in to your Azure account by typing `azure login` and using your work or school identity at the prompts

Now type `azure` to see a list of the top level commands described in the sections below.

## azure account: Manage your account information and publish settings
Your Azure subscription information is used by the tool to connect to your account. This information can be obtained from the Azure portal in a publish settings file as described here. You can import the publish settings file as a persistent local configuration setting that the tool will use for subsequent operations. You only need to import your publish settings once.
