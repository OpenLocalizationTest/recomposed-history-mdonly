# What are PowerApps?

PowerApps is a Microsoft Azure offering that extends creating mobile apps to power users within your company. Using an Office-style interface including ribbons and Excel formulas, you can create apps that:

- Show data using line, pie, and bar charts, just like you can in Excel.
- Create user interfaces that includes buttons, inserting text, and formatting a date.
- Add multiple-choice controls including list boxes, drop-down lists, and radio buttons.
- Upload images, take a picture, and play audio/video files.
- Use 'backend' systems like Excel and SQL Server to display and update information.
- Add pre-built App Service connectors to your apps that connect to PaaS programs like Twitter and SharePoint.
