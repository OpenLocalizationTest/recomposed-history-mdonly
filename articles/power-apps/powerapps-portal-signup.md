# Sign-up overview
PowerApps is a new offering available to companies with an Azure subscription. You can sign-up for PowerApps and allow anyone within your company to create and use PowerApps within your company subscription. 


#### Requirements to get started

- Azure company subscription
- Subscription Administrator signs-in to the Azure portal


## Sign-up your company to use PowerApps 

> [AZURE.NOTE] The following steps require the subscription Administrator to sign-in to the Azure portal and submit a request. 

To sign-up your company, the subscription administrator submits a request for *@yourCompany.com* email accounts. Use the following steps to sign-up:

1. In the Azure portal, sign-in to your work subscription.
2. Select **Browse All** in the task bar:  
![Browse for PowerApps][1]  
3. In the list, you can scroll to find PowerApps. You can also select **Resources**, and type in *powerapps*:
![Search for PowerApps in Resources][2]  
4. Next, submit your request to sign-up for PowerApps:  
![Submit your request][3]  


Once approved, everyone with the *@yourCompany.com* email address potentially has access to PowerApps. Within PowerApps, you can:  

- Add users within your company and using [role-based access control](../role-based-access-control-configure.md), give these users specific roles to the PowerApps apps.
- Creating connectors to run within your App Service environment (ASE).
- View performance metrics for your App Service environment.
- Add additional apps to your ASE, including web apps and mobile apps.
- See the PowerApps apps hosted within the App Service environment and their respective "owners".

In the following example, the Contoso company signed-up for PowerApps. In this new **PowerApps apps** blade, you can see all the apps created within this app service environment, including the *Audio notes* and *Link forms* apps. In **Connection providers**, you can see all the connectors used by your PowerApps apps, including Twitter and Youtube:

## Next step
Now that you're company is signed up for PowerApps, [create an app service environment](powerapps-create-new-ase.md) to host your PowerApps apps.
