#Create a new Excel API in your organization's App Service Environment

1. In the Azure portal, open **PowerApps**. In PowerApps, select **Registered APIs** tile or select it from *Settings*:  


2. In the **Registered APIs** blade, select **Add** to add a new API

3. Configure the API properties:  


	a) Enter a descriptive **name** for your API. For example, if you're adding the SQL connector, you can name it *SQLOrdersDB*.  
	
	b) In **Source**, select **Marketplace** to select a pre-built connector. Select **Existing API** to choose a connector you created (the .json and .manifest files are needed).  
	
	c) Select **API** from Azure Marketplace.  

4. Select **Excel** from Azure Marketplace

	
5. Select **OK**. Excel API is now added to the list of **Registered APIs** in your app service environment.
