# This is a test of included text

Here's an attempt to put a link to the level-3 headings in the include file. The first link is defined here, the second is defined in the include file.

- [Heading A]
- [Heading B]

[Heading A]: #heading-a

Here is some text.

Now here are 2 include files embedded in a table:

|-|-|
| [AZURE.INCLUDE [machine-learning-heading-3-1](../includes/machine-learning-heading-3-1.md)] |(blank)
| [AZURE.INCLUDE [machine-learning-heading-3-2](../includes/machine-learning-heading-3-2.md)]

Now here is an include file with level 3 headings:
