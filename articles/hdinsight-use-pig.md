##<a id="usage"></a>The Pig usage case
Databases are great for small sets of data and low latency queries. However, when it comes to big data and large data sets in terabytes, traditional SQL databases are not the ideal solution. As database load increases and performance degrades, historically, database administrators have had to buy bigger hardware. 

Generally, all applications save errors, exceptions and other coded issues in a log file, so administrators can review the problems, or generate certain metrics from the log file data. These log files usually get quite large in size, containing a wealth of data that must be processed and mined. 

Log files are a good example of big data. Working with big data is difficult using relational databases and statistics/visualization packages. Due to the large amounts of data and the computation of this data, parallel software running on tens, hundreds, or even thousands of servers is often required to compute this data in a reasonable time. Hadoop provides a MapReduce framework for writing applications that processes large amounts of structured and unstructured data in parallel across large clusters of machines in a very reliable and fault-tolerant manner.



[Apache *Pig*][apachepig-home] provides a scripting language to execute *MapReduce* jobs as an alternative to writing Java code. Pig's scripting language is called *Pig Latin*. Pig Latin statements follow this general flow:   

- **Load**: Read data to be manipulated from the file system
- **Transform**: Manipulate the data 
- **Dump or store**: Output data to the screen or store for processing




Using Pig reduces the time needed to write mapper and reducer programs. This means that no Java is required, and there is no need for boilerplate code. You also have the flexibility to combine Java code with Pig. Many complex algorithms can be written in less than five lines of human-readable Pig code.

The visual representation of what you will accomplish in this article is shown in the following two figures. These figures show a representative sample of the dataset to illustrate the flow and transformation of the data as you run through the lines of Pig code in the script. The first figure shows a sample of the log4j file:

![Whole File Sample][image-hdi-log4j-sample]

The second figure shows the data transformation:

![HDI.PIG.Data.Transformation][image-hdi-pig-data-transformation]

For more information on Pig Latin, see [Pig Latin Reference Manual 1][piglatin-manual-1] and [Pig Latin Reference Manual 2][piglatin-manual-2].







##<a id="prerequisites"></a> Prerequisites

Note the following requirements before you begin this article:

* An Azure HDInsight cluster. For instructions, see [Get started with Azure HDInsight][hdinsight-get-started] or [Provision HDInsight clusters][hdinsight-provision]. You will need the following data to go through the tutorial:

	<table border = "1">
	<tr><th>Cluster property</th><th>PowerShell variable name</th><th>Value</th><th>Description</th></tr>
	<tr><td>HDInsight cluster name</td><td>$clusterName</td><td></td><td>The HDInsight cluster on which you will run this tutorial.</td></tr>
	</table>


* Install and configure Azure PowerShell. For instructions, see [Install and configure Azure PowerShell][powershell-install-configure].


**Understand HDInsight storage**

HDInsight uses Azure Blob Storage for data storage.  It is called *WASB* or *Azure Storage - Blob*. WASB is Microsoft's implementation of HDFS on Azure Blob storage. For more information see [Use Azure Blob storage with HDInsight][hdinsight-storage]. 

When provision an HDInsight cluster, an Azure Storage account and a specific Blob storage container from that account is designated as the default file system, just like in HDFS. In addition to this storage account, additional storage accounts from either the same Azure subscription or different Azure subscriptions can be added during the provision process. For instructions on adding additional storage accounts, see [Provision HDInsight clusters][hdinsight-provision]. To simply the PowerShell script used in this tutorial, all of the files are stored in the default file system container, located at */tutorials/usepig*. By default this container has the same name as the HDInsight cluster name. 
The WASB syntax is:

	wasb[s]://<ContainerName>@<StorageAccountName>.blob.core.windows.net/<path>/<filename>

> [WACOM.NOTE] Only the *wasb://* syntax is supported in HDInsight cluster version 3.0. The older *asv://* syntax is supported in HDInsight 2.1 and 1.6 clusters, but it is not supported in HDInsight 3.0 clusters and it will not be supported in later versions.

> [WACOM.NOTE] The WASB path is a virtual path.  For more information see [Use Azure Blob storage with HDInsight][hdinsight-storage]. 

A file stored in the default file system container can be accessed from HDInsight using any of the following URIs (using sample.log as an example.  This file is the data file used in this tutorial):

	wasb://mycontainer@mystorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/example/data/sample.log
	wasb:///example/data/sample.log
	/example/data/sample.log

If you want to access the file directly from the storage account, the blob name for the file is:

	example/data/sample.log


In this article you will use a log4j sample file that comes with HDInsight clusters stored in *\example\data\sample.log*. For information on uploading your own data files, see [Upload data to HDInsight][hdinsight-upload-data].

















	
##<a id="understand"></a> Understand Pig Latin

In this session, you will review some Pig Latin statements, and the results after running the statements. In the next session, you will run PowerShell to execute the Pig statements.

1. Load data from the file system, and then display the results 

		LOGS = LOAD 'wasb:///example/data/sample.log';
		DUMP LOGS;
	
	The output is similar to the following:
	
		(2012-02-05 19:23:50 SampleClass5 [TRACE] verbose detail for id 313393809)
		(2012-02-05 19:23:50 SampleClass6 [DEBUG] detail for id 536603383)
		(2012-02-05 19:23:50 SampleClass9 [TRACE] verbose detail for id 564842645)
		(2012-02-05 19:23:50 SampleClass8 [TRACE] verbose detail for id 1929822199)
		(2012-02-05 19:23:50 SampleClass5 [DEBUG] detail for id 1599724386)
		(2012-02-05 19:23:50 SampleClass0 [INFO] everything normal for id 2047808796)
		(2012-02-05 19:23:50 SampleClass2 [TRACE] verbose detail for id 1774407365)
		(2012-02-05 19:23:50 SampleClass2 [TRACE] verbose detail for id 2099982986)
		(2012-02-05 19:23:50 SampleClass4 [DEBUG] detail for id 180683124)
		(2012-02-05 19:23:50 SampleClass2 [TRACE] verbose detail for id 1072988373)
		(2012-02-05 19:23:50 SampleClass9 [TRACE] verbose detail)
		...

2. Go through each line in the data file to find a match on the 6 log levels:

		LEVELS = foreach LOGS generate REGEX_EXTRACT($0, '(TRACE|DEBUG|INFO|WARN|ERROR|FATAL)', 1)  as LOGLEVEL;
 
3. Filter out the rows that do not have a match. For example, the empty rows.

		FILTEREDLEVELS = FILTER LEVELS by LOGLEVEL is not null;
		DUMP FILTEREDLEVELS;

	The output is similar to the following:

		(DEBUG)
		(TRACE)
		(TRACE)
		(DEBUG)
		(TRACE)
		(TRACE)
		(DEBUG)
		(TRACE)
		(TRACE)
		(DEBUG)
		(TRACE)
		...

4. Group all of the log levels into their own row:

		GROUPEDLEVELS = GROUP FILTEREDLEVELS by LOGLEVEL;
		DUMP GROUPEDLEVELS;

	The output is similar to the following:

		(TRACE),(TRACE),(TRACE),(TRACE),(TRACE),(TRACE),(TRACE),(TRACE),
		(TRACE),(TRACE),(TRACE),(TRACE),(TRACE),(TRACE),(TRACE),(TRACE),
		(TRACE),(TRACE),(TRACE),(TRACE),(TRACE),(TRACE),(TRACE),(TRACE),
		(TRACE),(TRACE),(TRACE),(TRACE),(TRACE),(TRACE),(TRACE),(TRACE),
		(TRACE),(TRACE),(TRACE),(TRACE),(TRACE),(TRACE),(TRACE),(TRACE),
		(TRACE),(TRACE),(TRACE),(TRACE),(TRACE),(TRACE),(TRACE),(TRACE),
		(TRACE),(TRACE),(TRACE),(TRACE),(TRACE),(TRACE),(TRACE),(TRACE),
		(TRACE),(TRACE),(TRACE),(TRACE),(TRACE),(TRACE),(TRACE),(TRACE),
		(TRACE),(TRACE),(TRACE),(TRACE),(TRACE),(TRACE),(TRACE),(TRACE),
		(TRACE),(TRACE),(TRACE),(TRACE),(TRACE),(TRACE),(TRACE),(TRACE),
		(TRACE), ...


5. For each group, count the occurrences of log levels. These is the frequencies of each log level:

		FREQUENCIES = foreach GROUPEDLEVELS generate group as LOGLEVEL, COUNT(FILTEREDLEVELS.LOGLEVEL) as COUNT;
		DUMP FREQUENCIES;
 
	The output is similar to the following:

		(INFO,3355)
		(WARN,361)
		(DEBUG,15608)
		(ERROR,181)
		(FATAL,37)
		(TRACE,29950)

6. Sort the frequencies in descending order:

		RESULT = order FREQUENCIES by COUNT desc;
		DUMP RESULT;   

	The output is similar to the following: 

		(TRACE,29950)
		(DEBUG,15608)
		(INFO,3355)
		(WARN,361)
	 	(ERROR,181)
		(FATAL,37)

##<a id="powershell"></a>Submit Pig jobs using PowerShell

This section provides instructions for using PowerShell cmdlets. Before you go through this section, you must first setup the local environment, and configure the connection to Azure. For details, see [Get started with Azure HDInsight][hdinsight-get-started] and [Administer HDInsight using PowerShell][hdinsight-admin-powershell].


**To run Pig Latin using PowerShell**

1. Open Windows PowerShell ISE (On Windows 8 Start screen, type **PowerShell_ISE** and then click **Windows PowerShell ISE**. See [Start Windows PowerShell on Windows 8 and Windows][powershell-start]).
2. In the bottom pane, run the following command to connect to your Azure subscription:

		Add-AzureAccount

	You will be prompted to enter your Azure account credentials. This method of adding a subscription connection times out, and after 12 hours, you will have to run the cmdlet again. 

	> [WACOM.NOTE] If you have multiple Azure subscriptions and the default subscription is not the one you want to use, use the <strong>Select-AzureSubscription</strong> cmdlet to select the current subscription.
2. In the script pane, copy and paste the following lines:

		$clusterName = "<HDInsightClusterName>" 
		$statusFolder = "/tutorials/usepig/status"

3. Set the variable $clusterName. 

3. Append the following lines in the script pane. These lines define the Pig Latin query string, and create a Pig job definition:

		# Create the Pig job definition
		$0 = '$0';
		$QueryString =  "LOGS = LOAD 'wasb:///example/data/sample.log';" +
		                "LEVELS = foreach LOGS generate REGEX_EXTRACT($0, '(TRACE|DEBUG|INFO|WARN|ERROR|FATAL)', 1)  as LOGLEVEL;" +
		                "FILTEREDLEVELS = FILTER LEVELS by LOGLEVEL is not null;" +
		                "GROUPEDLEVELS = GROUP FILTEREDLEVELS by LOGLEVEL;" +
		                "FREQUENCIES = foreach GROUPEDLEVELS generate group as LOGLEVEL, COUNT(FILTEREDLEVELS.LOGLEVEL) as COUNT;" +
		                "RESULT = order FREQUENCIES by COUNT desc;" +
		                "DUMP RESULT;" 
		
		$pigJobDefinition = New-AzureHDInsightPigJobDefinition -Query $QueryString -StatusFolder $statusFolder 

	You can also use the -File switch to specify a Pig script file on HDFS. The -StatusFolder switch puts the standard error log and the standard output file into the folder.

4. Append the following lines for submitting the Pig job:
		
		# Submit the Pig job
		Write-Host "Submit the Pig job ..." -ForegroundColor Green
		$pigJob = Start-AzureHDInsightJob -Cluster $clusterName -JobDefinition $pigJobDefinition  

5. Append the following lines for waiting for the Pig job to complete:		

		# Wait for the Pig job to complete
		Write-Host "Wait for the Pig job to complete ..." -ForegroundColor Green
		Wait-AzureHDInsightJob -Job $pigJob -WaitTimeoutInSeconds 3600

6. Append the following liens to print the Pig job output:
		
		# Print the standard error and the standard output of the Pig job.
		#Write-Host "Display the standard error log ..." -ForegroundColor Green
		#Get-AzureHDInsightJobOutput -Cluster $clusterName -JobId $pigJob.JobId -StandardError

		Write-Host "Display the standard output ..." -ForegroundColor Green
		Get-AzureHDInsightJobOutput -Cluster $clusterName -JobId $pigJob.JobId -StandardOutput

	> [WACOM.NOTE] One of the Get-AzureHDInsightJobOut cmdlets is commented for shortening the output in the following screenshot.   

7. Press **F5** to run the script:
	![HDI.Pig.PowerShell][image-hdi-pig-powershell]

	The Pig job calculates the frequencies of different log types.

##<a id="nextsteps"></a>Next steps

While Pig allows you to perform data analysis, other languages included with HDInsight may be of interest to you also. Hive provides a SQL-like query language that allows you to easily query against data stored in HDInsight, while MapReduce jobs written in Java allow you to perform complex data analysis.
