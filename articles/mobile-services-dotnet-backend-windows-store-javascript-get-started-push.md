# Add push notifications to your Mobile Services app

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-selector-get-started-push-legacy](../includes/mobile-services-selector-get-started-push-legacy.md)]

This topic shows you how to use Azure Mobile Services with a .NET backend to send push notifications to a Windows Store app. In this tutorial you enable push notifications using Azure Notification Hubs to the quickstart project. When complete, your mobile service will send a push notification from the .NET backend using Notification Hubs each time a record is inserted. The notification hub that you create is free with your mobile service, can be managed independent of the mobile service, and can be used by other applications and services.

>[AZURE.NOTE]This topic shows you how to manually configure push notifications using Windows Notification Service (WNS) for a Windows Store app. You can use Visual Studio 2013 tools to automatically configure the same push notifications in a Windows app project. For more information, see the [universal Windows app version](/en-us/documentation/articles/mobile-services-dotnet-backend-windows-universal-javascript-get-started-push) of this tutorial.

This tutorial walks you through these basic steps to enable push notifications:

1. [Register your app with WNS and configure Mobile Services](#register)
2. [Update the app to register for notifications](#update-app)
3. [Update the server to send push notifications](#update-server)
4. [Enable push notifications for local testing](#local-testing)
5. [Insert data to receive push notifications](#test)

This tutorial is based on the Mobile Services quickstart. Before you start this tutorial, you must first complete either [Get started with Mobile Services] or [Get started with data] to connect your project to the mobile service. When a mobile service has not been connected, the Add Push Notification wizard creates this connection for you. 

##<a id="register"></a> Register your app with WNS and configure Mobile Services

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-notification-hubs-register-windows-store-app](../includes/mobile-services-notification-hubs-register-windows-store-app.md)]

Both your mobile service and your app are now configured to work with WNS and Notification Hubs. Next, you will update your Windows Store app to register for notifications.

##<a id="update-app"></a> Update the app to register for notifications

Before your app can receive push notifications, you must register a notification channel.

1. Open the file default.js and insert the following code after the code that creates the **MobileServiceClient** instance. This code creates a push notification channel and registers for push notifications:

        // Request a push notification channel.
        Windows.Networking.PushNotifications
            .PushNotificationChannelManager
            .createPushNotificationChannelForApplicationAsync()
            .then(function (channel) {
                // Register for notifications using the new channel
                client.push.registerNative(channel.uri);
            }, function (error) {
                var message = "Registration failed: " + error.message;
                var dialog = new Windows.UI.Popups.MessageDialog(message);
                dialog.showAsync();
            });

    This code retrieves the ChannelURI for the app from WNS, and then registers that ChannelURI for push notifications. If the registration fails, the error message will be displayed in a message dialog.

2. In Visual Studio, open the Package.appxmanifest file and make sure **Toast capable** is set to **Yes** on the **Application UI** tab.

   	This makes sure that your app can raise toast notifications. These notifications are already enabled in the downloaded quickstart project.
