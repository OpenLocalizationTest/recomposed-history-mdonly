This topic shows you how to use Windows Azure .Net runtime mobile services to send push notifications to a Windows Store JavaScript app. 
In this tutorial you enable enhanced push notifications using Windows Azure Notification Hubs to the quickstart project. When complete, your mobile service will send a push notification using Notification Hubs each time a record is inserted. The notification hub that you create is free with your mobile service, can be managed independent of the mobile service, and can be used by other applications and services.

>[WACOM.NOTE] For guidance on how to use the legacy support for push notifications, see [this version of the topic](/en-us/documentation/articles/mobile-services-windows-store-javascript-get-started-push/).

This tutorial walks you through these basic steps to enable push notifications:

1. [Register your app with WNS and configure Mobile Services](#register)
2. [Update the app to register for notifications](#update-app)
3. [Update the server to send push notifications](#update-server)
3. [Insert data to receive push notifications](#test)

This tutorial is based on the Mobile Services quickstart. Before you start this tutorial, you must first complete either [Get started with Mobile Services] or [Get started with data] to connect your project to the mobile service. When a mobile service has not been connected, the Add Push Notification wizard creates this connection for you. 

##<a id="register"></a> Register your app with WNS and configure Mobile Services

[WACOM.INCLUDE [mobile-services-javascript-backend-register-windows-store-app](../includes/mobile-services-javascript-backend-register-windows-store-app.md)]

Both your mobile service and your app are now configured to work with WNS and Notification Hubs. Next, you will update your Windows Store app to register for notifications.

##<a id="update-app"></a> Update the app to register for notifications

Before your app can receive push notifications, you must register a notification channel.

1. Open the file default.js and insert the following code after the code that creates the **MobileServiceClient** instance. This code creates a push notification channel and registers for push notifications:

        // Request a push notification channel.
        Windows.Networking.PushNotifications
            .PushNotificationChannelManager
            .createPushNotificationChannelForApplicationAsync()
            .then(function (channel) {
                // Register for notifications using the new channel
                var result = client.push.registerNative(channel.uri);
                var message = "Registration successful: " + result.RegistrationId;

                // Display a message with the registration ID.
                var dialog = new Windows.UI.Popups.MessageDialog(message);
                dialog.showAsync();
            }, function (error) {
                var message = "Registration failed: " + error.description;
                var dialog = new Windows.UI.Popups.MessageDialog(message);
                dialog.showAsync();
            });        

    This code retrieves the ChannelURI for the app from WNS, and then registers that ChannelURI for push notifications.

5. Press the **F5** key to run the app. A popup dialog with the registration key is displayed.

6. In Visual Studio, open the Package.appxmanifest file and make sure **Toast capable** is set to **Yes** on the **Application UI** tab.

   	![][1]

   	This makes sure that your app can raise toast notifications. These notifications are already enabled in the downloaded quickstart project.

##<a id="update-server"></a> Update the server to send push notifications


1. In Visual Studio, open TodoItemController.cs and update the following code for the `PostTodoItem` method definition so that it will send the push notification on inserting a todo item.

        public async Task<IHttpActionResult> PostTodoItem(TodoItem item)
        {
            TodoItem current = await InsertAsync(item);
            WindowsPushMessage message = new WindowsPushMessage();
            message.XmlPayload = @"<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?><toast><visual>     
                                    <binding template=""ToastText01"">  <text id=""1"">" +
                                        item.Text + @"</text></binding></visual></toast>";
            var result = await Services.Push.SendAsync(message);
            Services.Log.Info(result.State.ToString());
            return CreatedAtRoute("Tables", new { id = current.Id }, current);
        }

This code sends a push notification (with the text of the inserted item) to all registrations after the insert succeeds.

##<a id="test"></a> Test push notifications in your app

1. In Visual Studio, press the F5 key to run the app.

2. In the app, type text in **Insert a TodoItem**, and then click **Save**.

   	![][2]

   	Note that after the insert completes, the app receives a push notification from WNS.
