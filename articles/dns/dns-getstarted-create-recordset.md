# Create DNS record sets and records using PowerShell

This article will walk you through creating records and records sets by using PowerShell. After creating your DNS Zone, you need to add the DNS records for your domain. To do this, you'll first need to understand DNS records and record sets.

[AZURE.INCLUDE [dns-about-records-include](../../includes/dns-about-records-include.md)] 

## Before you begin

Verify that you have installed the latest version of the Azure Resource Manager PowerShell cmdlets. See [How to install and configure Azure PowerShell](../powershell-install-configure.md) for more information about installing the PowerShell cmdlets.

## Create a record set and a record

In this section, we will show you how to create a record set and records.


### 1. Connect to your subscription 

Open your PowerShell console and connect to your account. Use the following sample to help you connect:

	Login-AzureRmAccount

Check the subscriptions for the account.

	Get-AzureRmSubscription 

Specify the subscription that you want to use.

	Select-AzureRmSubscription -SubscriptionName "Replace_with_your_subscription_name"

For more information about working with PowerShell, see [Using Windows PowerShell with Resource Manager](../powershell-azure-resource-manager.md).


### 2. Create a record set

Record sets are created using the `New-AzureRmDnsRecordSet` cmdlet. When creating a record set, you'll need to specify the record set name, the zone, the Time-to-Live (TTL), and the record type.

To create a record set in the apex of the zone (in this case, 'contoso.com'), use the record name "@", including the quotation marks. This is a common DNS convention.

The example below creates a record set has relative name *www* in the DNS Zone *contoso.com*. The fully-qualified name of the records will be *www.contoso.com*, the record type is *A*, and the TTL is 60 seconds. After completing this step, you will have an empty *www* record set that is assigned to the variable *$rs*.

	$rs = New-AzureRmDnsRecordSet -Name "www" -RecordType "A" -ZoneName "contoso.com" -ResourceGroupName "MyAzureResourceGroup" -Ttl 60

#### If a record set already exists

If a record set already exists, the command will fail unless the *-Overwrite* switch is used. The *-Overwrite* option will trigger a confirmation prompt, which can be suppressed using the *-Force* switch.


	$rs = New-AzureRmDnsRecordSet -Name www -RecordType A -Ttl 300 -ZoneName contoso.com -ResouceGroupName MyAzureResouceGroup [-Tag $tags] [-Overwrite] [-Force]


In the above example, the zone is specified using the zone name and resource group name. Alternatively, you can specify a zone object, as returned by `Get-AzureRmDnsZone` or `New-AzureRmDnsZone`.

	$zone = Get-AzureRmDnsZone -Name contoso.com –ResourceGroupName MyAzureResourceGroup
	$rs = New-AzureRmDnsRecordSet -Name www -RecordType A -Ttl 300 –Zone $zone [-Tag $tags] [-Overwrite] [-Force]

`New-AzureRmDnsRecordSet` returns a local object representing the record set created in Azure DNS.

### 3. Add a record

In order to be able to use the newly created *www* record set, you'll need to add records to it. You can add IPv4 *A* records to the *www* record set using the example below. This example relies on the variable that you set, $rs, in the previous step. 

Adding records to a record set using `Add-AzureRmDnsRecordConfig` is an off-line operation. Only the local variable *$rs* is updated.


	Add-AzureRmDnsRecordConfig -RecordSet $rs -Ipv4Address 134.170.185.46
	Add-AzureRmDnsRecordConfig -RecordSet $rs -Ipv4Address 134.170.188.221

### 4. Commit the changes

Commit the changes to the record set. Use `Set-AzureRmDnsRecordSet` to upload the changes to the record set to Azure DNS.

	Set-AzureRmDnsRecordSet -RecordSet $rs

### 5. Retrieve the record set

You can retrieve the record set from Azure DNS using `Get-AzureRmDnsRecordSet` as shown in the following example.


	Get-AzureRmDnsRecordSet –Name www –RecordType A -ZoneName contoso.com -ResourceGroupName MyAzureResourceGroup


	Name              : www
	ZoneName          : contoso.com
	ResourceGroupName : MyAzureResourceGroup
	Ttl               : 3600
	Etag              : 68e78da2-4d74-413e-8c3d-331ca48246d9
	RecordType        : A
	Records           : {134.170.185.46, 134.170.188.221}
	Tags              : {}


You can also use nslookup or other DNS tools to query the new record set.  

If you have not yet delegated the domain to the Azure DNS name servers, you will need to specify the name server address for your zone explicitly.


	nslookup www.contoso.com ns1-01.azure-dns.com

	Server: ns1-01.azure-dns.com
	Address:  208.76.47.1

	Name:    www.contoso.com
	Addresses:  134.170.185.46
    	        134.170.188.221

## Additional record type examples
