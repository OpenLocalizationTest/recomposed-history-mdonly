After creating your DNS Zone, you need to add the DNS records for your domain.  To do this, you first need to understand DNS records and record sets.

## Understanding record sets and records

### About records

Each DNS record has a name and a type.

A  "fully qualified" domain name (FQDN) includes the zone name, whereas a "relative" name does not.  For example, the relative record name "www" in the zone "contoso.com" gives the fully qualified record name "www.contoso.com".

>[AZURE.NOTE] In Azure DNS, records are specified using relative names.

Records come in various types according to the data they contain. The most common type is an "**A**" record, which maps a name to an IPv4 address.  Another type is an "**MX**" record, which maps a name to a mail server.

Azure DNS supports all common DNS record types: A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, NS, SOA, SRV and TXT. Note that SPF records should be created using the TXT record type. See [this page](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7208#section-3.1) for more information.


### About record sets

Sometimes you need to create more than one DNS record with a given name and type. For example, suppose the www.contoso.com web site is hosted on two different IP addresses. This requires two different A records, one for each IP address. This is an example of a record set. 

	www.contoso.com.		3600	IN	A	134.170.185.46
	www.contoso.com.		3600	IN	A	134.170.188.221

Azure DNS manages DNS records using record sets. A record set is the collection of DNS records in a zone with the same name and the same type. Most record sets contain a single record, but examples like the one above in which a record set contains more than one record are not uncommon. 

Records sets of type SOA and CNAME are an exception; the DNS standards do not permit multiple records with the same name for these types.

To create a record set in the apex of the zone, use the record name "@", including the quotation marks. This is a common DNS convention, especially for MX records.

The Time-to-Live, or TTL, specifies how long each record is cached by clients before being re-queried. In the above example, the TTL is 3600 seconds or 1 hour. The TTL is specified for the record set, not for each record, so the same value is used for all records within that record set.

#### Wildcard record sets

Azure DNS supports [wildcard records](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wildcard_DNS_record).  These are returned for any query with a matching name (unless there is a closer match from a non-wildcard record set). Wildcard record sets are supported for all record types except NS and SOA.  

To create a wildcard record set, use the record set name "\*", or a name whose first label is "\*", e.g. "\*.foo".

#### CNAME record sets

CNAME record sets cannot co-exist with other record sets with the same name. For example, you cannot create a CNAME with the relative name "www" and an A record with the relative name "www" at the same time. Since the zone apex (name = ‘@’) always contains the NS and SOA record sets created when the zone is created, this means you cannot create a CNAME record set at the zone apex. These constraints arise from the DNS standards, they are not limitations of Azure DNS.


## To create a record set and a record

The following example will walk you through how to create a record set and records by using the Azure portal. We'll use the DNS 'A' record type. For other record types see [How to manage DNS records](dns-operations-recordsets.md)

1. Log in to the Azure portal.
2. Navigate to the DNS zone blade in which you want to create a record set.
3. In your DNS zone blade, at the top of the blade click **Record set** to open the **Add record set** blade.
4. In the **Add record set** blade, name your records set. For example, you could name your record set "**www**".
5. Type, select the type of record you want to create. For example, **A**.
6. Set the **TTL**. The default in the portal is 1 hour.
7. Add the IP addresses, one IP address per line. Using the suggested record set name and record type from above, this adds the IPv4 IP addresses to the A record for the www record set.
8. When you have finished added IP addresses, click **OK**. The DNS record set will create.
