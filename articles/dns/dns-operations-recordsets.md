This article shows you how to manage record sets and records for your DNS zone using Azure PowerShell.

It is important to understand the difference between DNS record sets and individual DNS records. A record set is the collection of records in a zone with the same name and the same type. For more information, see [Understanding record sets and records](dns-getstarted-create-recordset-portal.md).

In order to manage your record sets and records, you'll need to install the latest version of the Azure Resource Manager PowerShell cmdlets. See [How to install and configure Azure PowerShell](../powershell-install-configure.md) for more information about installing the PowerShell cmdlets. For more information about working with PowerShell, see [Using Windows PowerShell with Resource Manager](../powershell-azure-resource-manager.md).



## Create a new record set and a record

To create a record set in the Azure portal, see [Create DNS records using the Azure portal](dns-getstarted-create-recordset.md).

## Get a record set

To retrieve an existing record set, use `Get-AzureRmDnsRecordSet`. Specify the record set relative name, the record type, and the zone.

	$rs = Get-AzureRmDnsRecordSet –Name www –RecordType A -ZoneName contoso.com -ResourceGroupName MyAzureResourceGroup

As with `New-AzureRmDnsRecordSet`, the record name must be a relative name, i.e. excluding the zone name.

The zone can be specified using either the zone name and resource group name, or using a zone object:

	$zone = Get-AzureRmDnsZone -Name contoso.com -ResouceGroupName MyAzureResourceGroup
	$rs = Get-AzureRmDnsRecordSet -Name www –RecordType A -Zone $zone

`Get-AzureRmDnsRecordSet` returns a local object representing the record set created in Azure DNS.

## List record sets

`Get-AzureRmDnsRecordSet` can also be used to list record sets by omitting the *–Name* and/or *–RecordType* parameters.

### To list all record sets

This example will return all record sets, regardless of name or record type:

	$list = Get-AzureRmDnsRecordSet -ZoneName contoso.com -ResourceGroupName MyAzureResourceGroup

### To list record sets of a given record type

This example will return all record sets matching the given record type. In this case, A records.

	$list = Get-AzureRmDnsRecordSet –RecordType A -ZoneName contoso.com -ResourceGroupName MyAzureResourceGroup

The zone can be specified using either the *–ZoneName* and *–ResourceGroupName* parameters (as shown), or by specifying a zone object:

	$zone = Get-AzureRmDnsZone -Name contoso.com -ResouceGroupName MyAzureResourceGroup
	$list = Get-AzureRmDnsRecordSet -Zone $zone

## Add a record to a record set

Records are added to record sets using the `Add-AzureRmDnsRecordConfig` cmdlet. This is an off-line operation—only the local object representing the record set is changed.

The parameters for adding records to a record set vary depending on the type of the record set. For example, when using a record set of type *A*, you will only be able to specify records with the parameter *-IPv4Address*.

Additional records can be added to each record set by additional calls to `Add-AzureRmDnsRecordConfig`. You can add up to 20 records to any record set. However, record sets of type *CNAME* can contain at most 1 record, and a record set cannot contain two identical records. Empty record sets (with zero records) can be created, but do not appear at the Azure DNS name servers.

Once the record set contains the desired collection of records, it needs to be committed using the `Set-AzureRmDnsRecordSet` cmdlet. Once a record set is committed, it will replace the existing record set in Azure DNS with the record set provided.

### To create an A record set with a single record

	$rs = New-AzureRmDnsRecordSet -Name "test-a" -RecordType A -Ttl 60 -ZoneName contoso.com -ResourceGroupName MyAzureResourceGroup
	Add-AzureRmDnsRecordConfig -RecordSet $rs -Ipv4Address "1.2.3.4"
	Set-AzureRmDnsRecordSet -RecordSet $rs

The sequence of operations to create a record can also be ‘piped’, passing the record set object using the pipe rather than as a parameter.  For example:

	New-AzureRmDnsRecordSet -Name "test-a" -RecordType A -Ttl 60 -ZoneName contoso.com -ResourceGroupName MyAzureResourceGroup | Add-AzureRmDnsRecordConfig -Ipv4Address "1.2.3.4" | Set-AzureRmDnsRecordSet

## Modify existing record sets

Modifying existing record sets follows a similar pattern as creating records. The sequence of operations is as follows:

1.	Retrieve the existing record set using `Get-AzureRmDnsRecordSet`.

2.	Modify the record set by either adding records, removing records, changing the record parameters, or changing the record set TTL. These changes are off-line—only the local object representing the record set is changed.

3.	Commit your changes using the `Set-AzureRmDnsRecordSet` cmdlet. This will replace the existing record set in Azure DNS with the record set provided.


### To update a record in an existing record set

In this example, we will change the IP address of an existing A record:

	$rs = Get-AzureRmDnsRecordSet -name "test-a" -RecordType A -ZoneName contoso.com -ResourceGroupName MyAzureResourceGroup
	$rs.Records[0].Ipv4Address = "134.170.185.46"
	Set-AzureRmDnsRecordSet -RecordSet $rs

The `Set-AzureRmDnsRecordSet` cmdlet uses *etag* checks to ensure concurrent changes are not overwritten. Use the *-Overwrite* flag to suppress these checks. See [About Etags and Tags](dns-getstarted-creatednszone.md#tagetag) for more information.

### To modify an SOA record

You cannot add or remove records from the automatically-created SOA record set at the zone apex (name = ‘@’), but you can modify any of the parameters within the SOA record (except 'Host') and the record set TTL.

The following example shows how to change the *Email* property of the SOA record:

	$rs = Get-AzureRmDnsRecordSet -Name "@" -RecordType SOA -ZoneName contoso.com -ResourceGroupName MyAzureResourceGroup
	$rs.Records[0].Email = "admin.contoso.com"
	Set-AzureRmDnsRecordSet -RecordSet $rs

### To modify NS records at the zone apex

You cannot add to, remove, or modify the records in the automatically-created NS record set at the zone apex (name = ‘@’). The only change permitted is to modify the record set TTL.

The following example shows how to change the TTL property of the NS record set:

	$rs = Get-AzureRmDnsRecordSet -Name "@" -RecordType NS -ZoneName contoso.com -ResourceGroupName MyAzureResourceGroup
	$rs.Ttl = 300
	Set-AzureRmDnsRecordSet -RecordSet $rs

### To add records to an existing record set

In this example we will add two additional MX records to the existing record set:

	$rs = Get-AzureRmDnsRecordSet -name "test-mx" -RecordType MX -ZoneName contoso.com -ResourceGroupName MyAzureResourceGroup
	Add-AzureRmDnsRecordConfig -RecordSet $rs -Exchange "mail2.contoso.com" -Preference 10
	Add-AzureRmDnsRecordConfig -RecordSet $rs -Exchange "mail3.contoso.com" -Preference 20
	Set-AzureRmDnsRecordSet -RecordSet $rs

## Remove a record from an existing record set

Records can be removed from a record set using `Remove-AzureRmDnsRecordConfig`. Note that the record being removed must be an exact match with an existing record across all parameters. Changes must be committed using `Set-AzureRmDnsRecordSet`.

Removing the last record from a record set does not delete the record set. See [Delete a record set](#delete-a-record-set) below for more information.


	$rs = Get-AzureRmDnsRecordSet -Name "test-a" -RecordType A -ZoneName contoso.com -ResourceGroupName MyAzureResourceGroup
	Remove-AzureRmDnsRecordConfig -RecordSet $rs -Ipv4Address "1.2.3.4"
	Set-AzureRmDnsRecordSet -RecordSet $rs

The sequence of operations to remove a record from a record set can also be ‘piped’, passing the record set object using the pipe rather than as a parameter. For example:

	Get-AzureRmDnsRecordSet -Name "test-a" -RecordType A -ZoneName contoso.com -ResourceGroupName MyAzureResourceGroup | Remove-AzureRmDnsRecordConfig -Ipv4Address "1.2.3.4" | Set-AzureRmDnsRecordSet

### Remove AAAA record from a record set

	$rs = Get-AzureRmDnsRecordSet -Name "test-aaaa" -RecordType AAAA -ZoneName contoso.com -ResourceGroupName MyAzureResourceGroup
	Remove-AzureRmDnsRecordConfig -RecordSet $rs -Ipv6Address "2607:f8b0:4009:1803::1005"
	Set-AzureRmDnsRecordSet -RecordSet $rs

### Remove CNAME record from a record set

Since a CNAME record set can contain at most one record, removing that record will leave an empty record set.

	$rs =  Get-AzureRmDnsRecordSet -name "test-cname" -RecordType CNAME -ZoneName contoso.com -ResourceGroupName MyAzureResourceGroup
	Remove-AzureRmDnsRecordConfig -RecordSet $rs -Cname "www.contoso.com"
	Set-AzureRmDnsRecordSet -RecordSet $rs

### Remove MX record from a record set

	$rs = Get-AzureRmDnsRecordSet -name "test-mx" -RecordType MX -ZoneName contoso.com -ResourceGroupName MyAzureResourceGroup
	Remove-AzureRmDnsRecordConfig -RecordSet $rs -Exchange "mail.contoso.com" -Preference 5
	Set-AzureRmDnsRecordSet -RecordSet $rs

### Remove NS record from record set

	$rs = Get-AzureRmDnsRecordSet -Name "test-ns" -RecordType NS -ZoneName contoso.com -ResourceGroupName MyAzureResourceGroup
	Remove-AzureRmDnsRecordConfig -RecordSet $rs -Nsdname "ns1.contoso.com"
	Set-AzureRmDnsRecordSet -RecordSet $rs

### Remove SRV record from a record set

	$rs = Get-AzureRmDnsRecordSet -Name "_sip._tls" -RecordType SRV -ZoneName contoso.com -ResourceGroupName MyAzureResourceGroup
	Remove-AzureRmDnsRecordConfig -RecordSet $rs –Priority 0 –Weight 5 –Port 8080 –Target "sip.contoso.com"
	Set-AzureRmDnsRecordSet -RecordSet $rs

### Remove TXT record from a record set

	$rs = Get-AzureRmDnsRecordSet -Name "test-txt" -RecordType TXT -ZoneName contoso.com -ResourceGroupName MyAzureResourceGroup
	Remove-AzureRmDnsRecordConfig -RecordSet $rs -Value "This is a TXT record"
	Set-AzureRmDnsRecordSet -RecordSet $rs

## Delete a record set

Record sets can be deleted using the `Remove-AzureRmDnsRecordSet` cmdlet. You cannot delete the SOA and NS record sets at the zone apex (name = ‘@’) that were created automatically when the zone was created. They will be deleted automatically if the zone is deleted.

Use one of the following three ways to remove a record set:

### Specify the all parameters by name

The optional *-Force* switch can be used to suppress the confirmation prompt.

	Remove-AzureRmDnsRecordSet -Name "test-a" -RecordType A -ZoneName contoso.com -ResourceGroupName MyAzureResourceGroup [-Force]


### Specify the record set by name and type, specify the zone by object

	$zone = Get-AzureRmDnsZone -Name contoso.com -ResourceGroupName MyAzureResourceGroup
	Remove-AzureRmDnsRecordSet -Name "test-a" -RecordType A -Zone $zone [-Force]

### Specify the record set by object:

	$rs = Get-AzureRmDnsRecordSet -Name "test-a" -RecordType A -ZoneName contoso.com -ResourceGroupName MyAzureResourceGroup
	Remove-AzureRmDnsRecordSet –RecordSet $rs [-Overwrite] [-Force]

Specifying the record set using an object enables etag checks to ensure concurrent changes are not deleted. The optional *-Overwrite* flag suppresses these checks. See [Etags and tags](dns-getstarted-create-dnszone.md#tagetag) for more information.

The record set object can also be piped instead of being passed as a parameter:

	Get-AzureRmDnsRecordSet -Name "test-a" -RecordType A -ZoneName contoso.com -ResourceGroupName MyAzureResourceGroup | Remove-AzureRmDnsRecordSet [-Overwrite] [-Force]
