# Use Azure DNS when setting your custom domain settings for a service

You can use Azure DNS to host a custom domain for any of your Azure resources that support custom domains. For example, you are creating an Azure web app and you want your users to access it by either using contoso.com, or www.contoso.com as an FQDN.

## Prerequisites

In order to use Azure DNS for your custom domain, you must first delegate your domain to Azure DNS. Visit [Delegate a domain to Azure DNS](../dns-delegate-domain-azure-dns.md) for instructions on how to configure your name servers for delegation.

## Retrieve the DNS name to alias

Navigate to the resource you are configuring a custom domain name for and click **Custom domains**.

Note the current url on the **Custom domains** blade, this address will be used as the alias for the DNS record created.

## Create the CNAME record

Navigate to your DNS Zone and click **+ Record set**. Fill out the following information on the **Add record set** blade and click **OK** to create it.


|Property  |Value  |Description  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Name     | mywebserver        | This along with the domain name label is the FQDN for the custom domain name.        |
|Type     | CNAME        | Use a CNAME record is using an alias. An A record would be used if the resource used an IP address.        |
|TTL     | 1        | 1 is used for 1 hour        |
|TTL unit     | Hours        | Hours is used as the time measurement         |
|Alias     | webserver.azurewebsites.net        | The DNS name you are creating the alias for, in this example its the webserver.azurewebsites.net DNS name provided by default to the web app.        |

Choose a type of **CNAME** and put the address you found in the previous step on your resource and put it in the **Alias** text box.

## Configure and validate the CNAME record

Navigate back to your resource that will be configured for the custom domain name and click **Custom domains**, then click **Hostnames**. To add the CNAME record you just created click **+ Add hostname**.

Once the process is complete, run **nslookup** to validate name resolution is working.
