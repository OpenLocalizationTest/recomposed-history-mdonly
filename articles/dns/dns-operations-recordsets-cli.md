# Manage DNS records and record sets using CLI

This article shows you how to manage record sets and records for your DNS zone using the cross-platform Azure CLI.


It's important to understand the difference between DNS record sets and individual DNS records. A record set is a collection of records in a zone with the same name and the same type. For more information, see [Understanding record sets and records](dns-getstarted-create-recordset-cli.md).


## Azure DNS and cross-platform Azure CLI

Azure DNS is an Azure Resource Manager-only service. It does not have an ASM API. You will need to make sure that the Azure CLI is configured to use Resource Manager mode, using the `azure config mode arm` command.

If you see "error: 'dns' is not an azure command" it is most likely because you are using Azure CLI in ASM mode, not Resource Manager mode.

## Create a new record set and a record

To create a record set in the Azure portal, see [Create a record set and records](dns-getstarted-create-recordset-cli.md).


## Get a record set

To retrieve an existing record set, use `azure network dns record-set show`, specifying resource group, zone name, record set relative name and the record type. Use the example below, replacing the values with your own.

	azure network dns record-set show myresourcegroup contoso.com www A


## List record sets

You can list all records in a DNS Zone using `azure network dns record-set list` command. You will need to specify the resource group name and zone name.

### To list all record sets

This will return all record sets, regardless of name or record type:

	azure network dns record-set list myresourcegroup contoso.com

### To list record sets of a given type

This will return all record sets matching the given record type (in this case, A records):

	azure network dns record-set list myresourcegroup contoso.com A 


## Add a record to a record set

Records are added to record sets using the `azure network dns record-set add-record`. The parameters for adding records to a record set vary depending on the type of the record set. For example, when using a record set of type 'A' you will only be able to specify records with the parameter `-a <IPv4 address>`.

To create record set, use `azure network dns record-set create`. Specify resource group, zone name, record set relative name, the record type and time to live (TTL). 
	
	azure network dns record-set create myresourcegroup  contoso.com "test-a"  A --ttl 300

>[AZURE.NOTE] If --ttl parameter is not defined, the value defaults to 4 (in seconds).


After creating the A record set, add the IPv4 address to the record set with `azure network dns record-set add-record`.

	azure network dns record-set add-record myresourcegroup contoso.com "test-a" A -a 192.168.1.1 


The following examples show how to create a record set of each record type containing a single record.

## Update a record in a record set

To add another IP address (1.2.3.4) to an existing A record set (www): 

	azure network dns record-set add-record  myresourcegroup contoso.com  A
	-a 1.2.3.4
	info:    Executing command network dns record-set add-record
	Record set name: www
	+ Looking up the dns zone "contoso.com"
	+ Looking up the DNS record set "www"
	+ Updating DNS record set "www"
	data:    Id                              : /subscriptions/################################/resourceGroups/myresourcegroup/providers/Microsoft.Network/dnszones/contoso.com/a/www
	data:    Name                            : www	
	data:    Type                            : Microsoft.Network/dnszones/a
	data:    Location                        : global
	data:    TTL                             : 4
	data:    A records:
	data:        IPv4 address                : 192.168.1.1
	data:        IPv4 address                : 1.2.3.4
	data:
	info:    network dns record-set add-record command OK

To remove an existing value from a record set use `azure network dns record-set delete-record`.
 
	azure network dns record-set delete-record myresourcegroup contoso.com www A -a 1.2.3.4
	info:    Executing command network dns record-set delete-record
	+ Looking up the DNS record set "www"
	Delete DNS record? [y/n] y
	+ Updating DNS record set "www"
	data:    Id                              : /subscriptions/################################/resourceGroups/myresourcegroup/providers/Microsoft.Network/dnszones/contoso.com/A/www
	data:    Name                            : www
	data:    Type                            : Microsoft.Network/dnszones/A
	data:    Location                        : global
	data:    TTL                             : 4
	data:    A records:
	data:        IPv4 address                : 192.168.1.1
	data:
	info:    network dns record-set delete-record command OK



## Remove a record from a record set

Records can be removed from a record set using `azure network dns record-set delete-record`. The record that is being removed must be an exact match with an existing record across all parameters.

Removing the last record from a record set does not delete the record set. See [Delete a record set](#delete) below for more.


	azure network dns record-set delete-record myresourcegroup contoso.com www A -a 192.168.1.1

	azure network dns record-set delete myresourcegroup contoso.com www A

### Remove an AAAA record from a record set

	azure network dns record-set delete-record myresourcegroup contoso.com test-aaaa  AAAA -b "2607:f8b0:4009:1803::1005"

### Remove a CNAME record from a record set

	azure network dns record-set delete-record myresourcegroup contoso.com test-cname CNAME -c www.contoso.com
	

### Remove an MX record from a record set

	azure network dns record-set delete-record myresourcegroup contoso.com "@" MX -e "mail.contoso.com" -f 5

### Remove an NS record from record set
	
	azure network dns record-set delete-record myresourcegroup contoso.com  "test-ns" NS -d "ns1.contoso.com"

### Remove an SRV record from a record set

	azure network dns record-set delete-record myresourcegroup contoso.com  "_sip._tls" SRV -p 0 -w 5 -o 8080 -u "sip.contoso.com" 

### Remove a TXT record from a record set

	azure network dns record-set delete-record myresourcegroup contoso.com  "test-TXT" TXT -x "this is a TXT record"

## <a name="delete"></a>Delete a record set

Record sets can be deleted using the `Remove-AzureDnsRecordSet` cmdlet.

>[AZURE.NOTE] You cannot delete the SOA and NS record sets at the zone apex (name = ‘@’) that are created automatically when the zone is created.  They will be deleted automatically when deleting the zone.

In the example below, the A record set "test-a" will be removed from contoso.com DNS zone:

	azure network dns record-set delete myresourcegroup contoso.com  "test-a" A 

The optional *-q* switch can be used to suppress the confirmation prompt.
