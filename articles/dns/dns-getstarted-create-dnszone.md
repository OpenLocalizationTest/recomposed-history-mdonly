# Create a DNS zone using PowerShell

> [!div class="op_single_selector"]
> * [Azure Portal](dns-getstarted-create-dnszone-portal.md)
> * [PowerShell](dns-getstarted-create-dnszone.md)
> * [Azure CLI](dns-getstarted-create-dnszone-cli.md)

This article walks you through the steps to create a DNS zone using Azure PowerShell. You can also create a DNS zone using the cross-platform Azure CLI or the Azure portal.

[!INCLUDE [dns-create-zone-about](../../includes/dns-create-zone-about-include.md)]

## Before you begin

Verify that you have the following items before beginning your configuration.

* An Azure subscription. If you don't already have an Azure subscription, you can activate your [MSDN subscriber benefits](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/member-offers/msdn-benefits-details/) or sign up for a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).
* You need to install the latest version of the Azure Resource Manager PowerShell cmdlets. For more information, see [How to install and configure Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azureps-cmdlets-docs/).

## Step 1 - Sign in and create a resource group

### Sign in to your Azure account

Open your PowerShell console and connect to your account. For more information, see [Using PowerShell with Resource Manager](../azure-resource-manager/powershell-azure-resource-manager.md).

```powershell
Login-AzureRmAccount
```

### Select the subscription
 
Check the subscriptions for the account.

```powershell
Get-AzureRmSubscription
```

Choose which of your Azure subscriptions to use.

```powershell
Select-AzureRmSubscription -SubscriptionName "Replace_with_your_subscription_name"
```

### Create a resource group

Azure Resource Manager requires that all resource groups specify a location. This location is used as the default location for resources in that resource group. However, because all DNS resources are global, not regional, the choice of resource group location has no impact on Azure DNS.

You can skip this step if you are using an existing resource group.

```powershell
New-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name MyAzureResourceGroup -location "West US"
```

### Register resource provider

The Azure DNS service is managed by the Microsoft.Network resource provider. Your Azure subscription must be registered to use this resource provider before you can use Azure DNS. This is a one-time operation for each subscription.

```powershell
Register-AzureRmResourceProvider -ProviderNamespace Microsoft.Network
```

## Step 2 - Create a DNS zone

A DNS zone is created by using the `New-AzureRmDnsZone` cmdlet. The example below creates a DNS zone called *contoso.com* in the resource group called *MyResourceGroup*. Use the example to create a DNS zone, substituting the values for your own.

```powershell
New-AzureRmDnsZone -Name contoso.com -ResourceGroupName MyAzureResourceGroup
```

## Step 3 - Verify

### View records

Creating a DNS zone also creates the following DNS records:

* The *Start of Authority* (SOA) record. This is present at the root of every DNS zone.
* The authoritative name server (NS) records. These show which name servers are hosting the zone. Azure DNS uses a pool of name servers, and so different name servers may be assigned to different zones in Azure DNS. See [delegate a domain to Azure DNS](dns-domain-delegation.md) for more information.

To view these records, use `Get-AzureRmDnsRecordSet`:

```powershell
Get-AzureRmDnsRecordSet -ZoneName contoso.com -ResourceGroupName MyAzureResourceGroup

Name              : @
ZoneName          : contoso.com
ResourceGroupName : MyAzureResourceGroup
Ttl               : 172800
Etag              : f573237b-088c-424a-b53c-08567d87d049
RecordType        : NS
Records           : {ns1-01.azure-dns.com., ns2-01.azure-dns.net., ns3-01.azure-dns.org., ns4-01.azure-dns.info.}
Metadata          : 

Name              : @
ZoneName          : contoso.com
ResourceGroupName : MyAzureResourceGroup
Ttl               : 3600
Etag              : bf88a27d-0eec-4847-ad42-f0c83b9a2c32
RecordType        : SOA
Records           : {[ns1-01.azure-dns.com.,azuredns-hostmaster.microsoft.com,3600,300,2419200,300]}
Metadata          : 
```

> [!NOTE]
> Record sets at the root (or *apex*) of a DNS Zone use **@** as the record set name.

### Test name servers

You can test your DNS zone is present on the Azure DNS name servers by using DNS tools such as nslookup, dig, or the [Resolve-DnsName PowerShell cmdlet](https://technet.microsoft.com/library/jj590781.aspx).

If you haven't yet delegated your domain to use the new zone in Azure DNS, you need to direct the DNS query directly to one of the name servers for your zone. The name servers for your zone are given in the NS records, as listed by `Get-AzureRmDnsRecordSet` above. Be sure the substitute the correct values for your zone into the command below.

    nslookup
    > set type=SOA
    > server ns1-01.azure-dns.com
    > contoso.com

    Server: ns1-01.azure-dns.com
    Address:  40.90.4.1

    contoso.com
            primary name server = ns1-01.azure-dns.com
            responsible mail addr = azuredns-hostmaster.microsoft.com
            serial  = 1
            refresh = 3600 (1 hour)
            retry   = 300 (5 mins)
            expire  = 2419200 (28 days)
            default TTL = 300 (5 mins)
