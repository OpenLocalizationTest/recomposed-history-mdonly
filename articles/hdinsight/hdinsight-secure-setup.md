# Configure Secure HDInsight

Learn how to setup a Linux-based HDInsight cluster with Azure Activie Directory(AAD) and Apache Ranger to take advantage of strong authentication and rich role based access control(RBAC) policies.  Secure HDInsight can only be configured on Linux-based clusters. For more information, see [Introduce Secure HDInsigit](hdinsight-secure-introduction.md).

This is the first part of the 2-part tutorial:

- Create an HDInsight cluster connected to AAD (via the Azure Directory Domain Services capability) with Apache Ranger enabled.
- Create and apply Hive policies through Apache Ranger, and allow users (e.g. business analysts) to connect to Hive using ODBC-based tools e.g. Excel, Tableau etc. Currently, other workloads, such as HBase, Spark and Storm,  are not supported. [jgao: how about YARN?]

An example of the final topology looks as follows:

![Secure HDInsight topology](.\media\hdinsight-secure-setup\hdinsight-secure-topology.png)

[jgao: I will update the image to match the names to the names used in this tutorial.]

Because AAD currently only supports classic virtual networks (VNets) and the Linux-based HDInsight only supports Azure Resource Manager (ARM) based VNets, HDInsight AAD integration requires two VNets and a bridge between the two. 

Most of the Azure service names must be globally unique.  The following are the names used in this tutorial. Contoso is a fictious name. You must replace *contoso* with a different name when you go through the tutorial.
	
**Names:**

- AAD VNet: contoso_aad_vnet
- AAD Virtual Machine (VM): contoso-aad-vm
- AAD directory: contoso-aad
- AAD domain name: contoso155
- HDInsight VNet: contoso_hdi_vnet
- HDInsight VNet resource group: contoso_hdi_rg
- HDInsight cluster: contoso_hdi_cluster
- ...

## Prerequisites:

- Familiarize yourself with [ADDS](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/active-directory-ds/) its [pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/active-directory-ds/) structure.
- Learn about [Apache Ranger](http://hortonworks.com/apache/ranger/), specifically how [Hive policies](http://hortonworks.com/apache/hive/) work.
- Ensure that your subscription is whitelisted for this private preview. You can do so by sending an email to adnan.ijaz@microsoft.com with your subscription ID.
- Azure PowerShell. Most of the steps use the Azure portal or Azure classic porta. Only a few steps in this tutorial requires Azure PowerShell.  You must install Azure PowerShell on a Windows workstation.

## Procedures

- Create a classic VNet with a VM.  

	You will use Azure Classic portal to create a classic VNet, and then create VM within the VNet. The VM will be used late to configure an organizational unit(OU).
	
- Create and configure an AAD.

	This part includes the following steps:

	- Create an AAD
	- Create **AAD DC Administrators** group. Members of this group will be granted administrative privileges on machines that are domain joined to the AAD domain you will setup.
	
		- After domain join, this group will be added to the Administrators group on these domain joined machines.
		- Members of this group will also be able to use Remote Desktop to connect remotely to domain joined machines. [jgao: this is not true based on my testing.  Need further testing.]

	- Create an AAD global admin user and add it to the AAD DC Administrators group. [jgao: is AAD global admin an overkill?]
	- Enable AAD services for the classic VNet.
	- Update DNS settings for the virtual network. 
	- (Optional) Enable password synchronization to AAD services for a cloud-only Azure AD directory. See [Enable password synchronization to AAD domain services for a cloud-only Azure AD directory](../active-directory/active-directory-ds-getting-started-password-sync.md)

	- Configure Secure LDAP for the AAD

- Configure an organizational unit

	- Join the VM to the domain
	
		[jgao: to do]
		- validate the AAD DC Administrators group is added to the local administrator's group
		- validate the remote desktop access permision
		
	- configure an oganizational unit
	
		- connect to the VM using the domain account
		
	- (?)Enable Secure Ldap access through the internet
	- (?)Configure DNS to access the managed domain from the internet


- create an arm VNet with an HDInsight cluster

- Bridge the two VNets

- Additional temporary steps.

	
## Create an Azure classic VNet with a VM

In this section, you will first create a classic VNet, and then add a VM into the VNet.  Later, you will join the VM to the AAD domain, and install AD tools on the VM to configure AAD on the VNet.

For additional information about the following procedure, see [Create a virtual network (classic) by using the Azure portal](../virtual-network/virtual-networks-create-vnet-classic-portal.md)

**To create a classic VNet**

1. Sign on to the [Azure classic portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com).
2. Click **New** > **Network Services** > **Custom Create**.
3. Enter or select **Name**, **Location** and **Subscription**, and then click **Next**.
4. On the **DNS Servers and VPN Connectivity** page, click **Next**. If you do not specify a DNS server, your VNet will use the internal naming resolution resolution provided by Azure. For our scenario, we will not configure DNS servers.
5. Configure **Address Space** with **10.1.0.0/16**, and **Subnet-1** with **10.1.0.0.24** as shown below:

	![Configure Secure HDInsight Azure Activie directory virtual network](.\media\hdinsight-secure-setup\hdinsight-secure-aad-vnet-setting.png)
	
6. Click **Complete** to create the VNet.

**To create a virtual machine into the virtual network**

1. Sign on to the [Azure classic portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com).
2. Click **New** > **Compute** > **Virtual Machine** > **From Gallery**.
3. Select an image, and then click **Next**.  If you don't know which one to use, select the default, **Windows Server 2012 R2 Data center**.
4. Enter or select the following values:

	- Virtual Machine Name: **contoso-aad-vm**
	- Tier: **Basic**
	- New User Name: **jgao**
	- Password: **Password123**
	
	Please note the username and the password is the local admin.
	
5. Click **Next**
6. In **Region/Virtual Network**, select the new virtual network you created in the last step, and then click **Next**.
7. Click **Complete**.

[jgao: provide a PowerShell script for automating the steps]
[jgao: is it better to move the creating VM part to the later of this tutorial?]

## Create Hadoop cluster into virtual network

clustername: contosohdi
resource group: contosohdirg

In this section, you will create a Linux-based Hadoop cluster in HDInsight using [Azure ARM template](../resource-group-template-deploy.md). The Azure ARM template experience is not required for following this tutorial. For other cluster creation methods and understanding the settings, see [Create HDInsight clusters](hdinsight-hadoop-provision-linux-clusters.md). For more information about using ARM template to create Hadoop clusters in HDInsight, see [Create Hadoop clusters in HDInsight using ARM templates](hdinsight-hadoop-create-windows-clusters-arm-templates.md)

1. Click the following image to open an ARM template in the Azure Portal. The ARM template is located in a public blob container. 

    <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fhditutorialdata.blob.core.windows.net%2Farmtemplates%2Fcreate-linux-based-hadoop-cluster-in-vnet.json" target="_blank"><img src="https://acom.azurecomcdn.net/80C57D/cdn/mediahandler/docarticles/dpsmedia-prod/azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/hdinsight-hbase-tutorial-get-started-linux/20160201111850/deploy-to-azure.png" alt="Deploy to Azure"></a>

2. From the **Parameters** blade, enter the following:

    - **ClusterName**: Enter a name for the Hadoop cluster that you will create.
    - **Cluster login name and password**: The default login name is **admin**.
    - **SSH username and password**: The default username is **sshuser**.  You can rename it. 

    A lot of properties have been hard-coded into the template. For example:
    
    - Location: East US
    - Cluster worker node count: 4
    - Default storage account: <Cluster Name>store
    - Virtual network name: <Cluster Name>-vnet
    - Virtual network address space: 10.0.0.0/16
    - Subnet name: default
    - Subnet address range: 10.0.0.0/24

3. Click **OK** to save the parameters.
4. From the **Custom deployment** blade, click **Resource group** dropdown box, and then click **New** to create a new resource group.  The resource group is a container that groups the cluster, the dependent storage account and other linked resource.
5. Click **Legal terms**, and then click **Create**.
6. Click **Create**. You will see a new tile titled **Submitting deployment for Template deployment**. It takes about around 20 minutes to create a cluster. Once the cluster is created, you can click the cluster blade in the portal to open it.

After you complete the tutorial, you might want to delete the cluster. With HDInsight, your data is stored in Azure Storage, so you can safely delete a cluster when it is not in use. You are also charged for an HDInsight cluster, even when it is not in use. Since the charges for the cluster are many times more than the charges for storage, it makes economic sense to delete clusters when they are not in use. For the instructions of deleting a cluster, see [Manage Hadoop clusters in HDInsight by using the Azure Portal](hdinsight-administer-use-management-portal.md#delete-clusters).



## Bridge the AAD VNet and the HDInsight VNet


3 steps:

**To create a VPN gateway for the AAD(classic) VNet**

1. Sign on to the [classic portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com).
2. Click **New** > **NETWORK SERVICES** > **VIRTUAL NETWORKS** > **ADD LOCAL NETWORK**. 
3. Enter a name for the ARM VNet you want to connect to, and then click **Next**. For example: contosohdi-vnet
4. Enter or select the following values:

	- In the address space STARTING IP text box, type the network prefix for the ARM VNet you want to connect to.
	- In the CIDR (ADDRESS COUNT) drop down, select the number of bits used for the network portion of the CIDR block used by the ARM VNet you want to connect to.
	- In VPN DEVICE IP ADDRESS (OPTIONAL), type any valid public IP address. For example, 192.168.0.1. We will change this IP address later. 
	

5. On the **Networks** page, click **VIRTUAL NETWORKS**, and then click on your classic VNet (contoso-aad_vnet), and then click **CONFIGURE**.
6. Under **site-to-site connectivity**,  check **Connect to the local network**, and then select the local network you just created in **Local Netwrok**.
7. Click **Save** on the bottom of the page.
8. Click **Yes** to confirm.
9. Click **Dashboard** from the top menu, click **Create Gateway** from the bottom of the page, click **Dynamic Routing**, and then click **Yes**. When it is done, copy the gateway public IP address. You will need it to setup the gateway in the ARM VNet. Don't worry if you see the status is disconnected.  It is expected. 23.96.115.230


**To create a VPN gateway for the ARM VNet**

1. Sign on to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
2. Click **New** > **Networking** > **Local network gateway**.
3. Select or enter:

	- Name:  contosohdivnetlocalgateway
	- IP Address: The public IP address of the gateway you created in the last step.
	- Address space: the CIDR block of the classic VNet, 10.1.0.0/16
	- Resource group: contosohdirg


3. Click **New** > **Networking** > **Virtual network gateway**.
4. Select or enter:

	- Name: contosohdivnetpublicgateway
	- Virtual network: ARM network name contosohdi-vnet.
	- Pulbic IP address: Create new: contosohdvnetpublicgatewayip


6. Open the virutal network public gateway.  In the Seetings > Properties, find the public IP address:  23.96.13.21 



**To connect the two gateways**

1. Sign on to the [classic portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com).
2. Click **Networks** > **Local Networks**, and then click the ARM VNet that you want to connect to. For example: contosohdi-vnet.
3. Click **Edit** from the bottom.
4. Replace **VPN Device IP Address** with the ARM VNet gateway public IP address: 23.96.13.21.
5. Click **Next**.
6. Click **Complete**.
7. From a PowerShell console, setup a shared key by running the command below. Make sure you change the names of the VNets to the your own VNet names.

		Set-AzureVNetGatewayKey -VNetName contoso_aad_vnet `
			-LocalNetworkSiteName contoso_hdi_vnet -SharedKey Pass@word123

8. Create the VPN connection by running the commands below.


		$vnet01gateway = Get-AzureRmLocalNetworkGateway -Name VNetClassic -ResourceGroupName RG1
		$vnet02gateway = Get-AzureRmVirtualNetworkGateway -Name v1v2Gateway -ResourceGroupName RG1

		New-AzureRmVirtualNetworkGatewayConnection -Name arm-asm-s2s-connection `
			-ResourceGroupName RG1 -Location "East US" -VirtualNetworkGateway1 $vnet02gateway `
			-LocalNetworkGateway2 $vnet01gateway -ConnectionType IPsec `
			-RoutingWeight 10 -SharedKey 'abc123'
