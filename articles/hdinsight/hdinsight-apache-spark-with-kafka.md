# Use Apache Spark with Kafka (preview) on HDInsight
Apache Spark can be used to stream data into or out of Apache Kafka. In this document, learn how to create a basic Spark application in Scala that writes to and reads from Kafka on HDInsight.

> [!NOTE]
> The steps in this document create a new Azure resource group that contains both a Spark on HDInsight and a Kafka on HDInsight cluster. These clusters are both located within an Azure Virtual Network, which allows the Storm cluster to directly communicate with the Kafka cluster.
> 
> When you are done with the steps in this document, please remeber to delete the clusters to avoid excess charges.
> 
> 

## Prerequisites
* An Azure subscription
* [Java JDK](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html) 1.8 or higher. Or an equivalent such as [OpenJDK](http://openjdk.java.net/).
  
  > [!NOTE]
  > The steps in this document use an HDInsight 3.5 cluster, which uses Java 8.
  > 
  > 
* [Maven 3.x](http://maven.apache.org/) - A build management package for Java applications.
* A text editor or Java IDE
* An SSH client (you need the `ssh` and `scp` commands) - For more information on using SSH with HDInsight, see the following documents:
  
  * [Use SSH with Linux-based HDInsight from Linux, Unix, and Mac OS](hdinsight-hadoop-linux-use-ssh-unix.md)
  * [Use SSH with Linux-based HDInsight from Windows](hdinsight-hadoop-linux-use-ssh-windows.md)

## Create the clusters
Apache Kafka on HDInsight does not provide access to the Kafka brokers over the public internet. Anything that talks to Kafka must be in the same Azure virtual network as the nodes in the Kafka cluster. For this example, both the Kafka and Spark clusters are located in an Azure virtual network. The following diagram shows how communication flows between the clusters:

![Diagram of Spark and Kafka clusters in an Azure virtual network](./media/hdinsight-apache-spark-with-kafka/spark-kafka-vnet.png)

> [!NOTE]
> Though Kafka itself is limited to communication within the virtual network, other services on the cluster such as SSH and Ambari can be accessed over the internet. For more information on the public ports available with HDInsight, see [Ports and URIs used by HDInsight](hdinsight-hadoop-port-settings-for-services.md).

While you can create an Azure virtual network, Kafka, and Spark clusters manually, it's easier to use an Azure Resource Manager template. Use the following steps to deploy an Azure virtual network, Kafka, and Spark clusters to your Azure subscription.

1. Use the following button to sign in to Azure and open the template in the Azure portal.
   
    <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fhditutorialdata.blob.core.windows.net%2Farmtemplates%2Fcreate-linux-based-kafka-spark-cluster-in-vnet.json" target="_blank"><img src="https://acom.azurecomcdn.net/80C57D/cdn/mediahandler/docarticles/dpsmedia-prod/azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/hdinsight-hbase-tutorial-get-started-linux/20160201111850/deploy-to-azure.png" alt="Deploy to Azure"></a>
   
    The Azure Resource Manager template is located at **https://hditutorialdata.blob.core.windows.net/armtemplates/create-linux-based-kafka-spark-cluster-in-vnet.json**.
2. From the **Parameters** blade, enter the following:
   
    ![HDInsight parameters](./media/hdinsight-apache-spark-with-kafka/parameters.png)
   
    **BASICS** section:
   
   * **Resource group**: Create a new group or select an existing one. This group will contain the HDInsight cluster.
   * **Location_: Select a location geographically close to you. This must match the location in the __SETTINGS** section.
     
     **SETTINGS** section:
   * **Base Cluster Name**: This value is used as the base name for the Spark and Kafka clusters. For example, entering **hdi** creates a Spark cluster named spark-hdi__ and a Kafka cluster named **kafka-hdi**.
   * **Cluster Login User Name**: The admin user name for the Spark and Kafka clusters.
   * **Cluster Login Password**: The admin user password for the Spark and Kafka clusters.
   * **SSH User Name**: The SSH user to create for the Spark and Kafka clusters.
   * **SSH Password**: The password for the SSH user for the Spark and Kafka clusters.
   * **Location**: The region that the clusters are created in.
3. Read the **Terms and Conditions**, and then select **I agree to the terms and conditions stated above**.
4. Finally, check **Pin to dashboard** and then select **Create**. It takes about 20 minutes to create the clusters.

Once the resources have been created, you are redirected to a blade for the resource group that contains the clusters and web dashboard.

![Resource group blade for the vnet and clusters](./media/hdinsight-apache-spark-with-kafka/groupblade.png)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Notice that the names of the HDInsight clusters are **storm-BASENAME** and **kafka-BASENAME**, where BASENAME is the name you provided to the template. You use these names in later steps when connecting to the clusters.

## Get the code
The code for the example described in this document is available at [https://github.com/Azure-Samples/hdinsight-spark-java-kafka](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/hdinsight-spark-java-kafka).

## Understanding the code
This project contains two pieces that do all the work:

* **KafkaWordProducer**: This emits random sentences to a Kafka topic every second.
* **KafkaWordCount**: This reads data from one or more Kafka topics, and maintains a count of how many times individual words occur.

## Create a Kafka topic
1. Connect to the Kafka cluster using SSH. Replace **USERNAME** with the SSH user name used when creating the cluster. Replace **BASENAME** with the base name used when creating the cluster.
   
        ssh USERNAME@kafka-BASENAME-ssh.azurehdinsight.net
   
    When prompted, enter the password you used when creating the clusters.
   
    For more information on using SSH with HDInsight, see the following documents:
   
   * [Use SSH with Linux-based HDInsight from Linux, Unix, and Mac OS](hdinsight-hadoop-linux-use-ssh-unix.md)
   * [Use SSH with Linux-based HDInsight from Windows](hdinsight-hadoop-linux-use-ssh-windows.md)
2. From the SSH connection to the Kafka cluster, use the following command to get the zookeeper nodes:
   
        ZKHOSTS=`grep -R zk /etc/hadoop/conf/yarn-site.xml | grep 2181 | grep -oPm1 "(?<=<value>)[^<]+"`
   
    This reads the values for the Zookeeper hosts from the yarn-site.xml file, and store them into the ZKHOSTS variable. Use the following to see these values:
   
        echo $ZKHOSTS
   
    The output of this command is similar to the following example:
   
        zk0-kafka.eahjefxxp1netdbyklgqj5y1ud.ex.internal.cloudapp.net:2181,zk2-kafka.eahjefxxp1netdbyklgqj5y1ud.ex.internal.cloudapp.net:2181,zk3-kafka.eahjefxxp1netdbyklgqj5y1ud.ex.internal.cloudapp.net:2181
   
    Save the values returned from this command, as these are used when starting the topology on the Storm cluster.
3. Use the following command to create a topic in Kafka:
   
        /usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-topics.sh --create --replication-factor 2 --partitions 8 --topic sparktest --zookeeper $ZKHOSTS
   
    This command connects to Zookeeper using the host information stored in `$ZKHOSTS`, and then creates a Kafka topic named **stormtest**. You can verify that the topic was created by using the following command to list topics:
   
        /usr/hdp/current/kafka-broker/bin/kafka-topics.sh --list --zookeeper $ZKHOSTS
   
    The output of this command lists Kafka topics, which should contain the new **sparktest** topic.

Close the SSH connection to the Kafka cluster, as it is not needed for the rest of this document.

## Download and compile the project
1. On your development environment, download the project from [https://github.com/Azure-Samples/hdinsight-spark-scala-kafka](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/hdinsight-spark-scala-kafka), open a command-line, and change directories to the location that you downloaded the project.
   
    Take a few moments to look over the code and understand how the project works.
2. From the **hdinsight-spark-scala-kafka** directory, use the following command to compile the project and create a package for deployment:
   
        mvn clean package
   
    The package process creates a file named `KafkaExample-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` in the `target` directory.
3. Use the following commands to copy the package to your Storm on HDInsight cluster. Replace **USERNAME** with the SSH user name for the cluster. Replace **BASENAME** with the base name you used when creating the cluster.
   
        cd target
        scp KafkaExample-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar USERNAME@storm-BASENAME-ssh.azurehdinsight.net:
   
    When prompted, enter the password you used when creating the clusters.

## Start the producer
1. Use the following to connect to the Storm cluster using SSH. Replace **USERNAME** with the SSH user name used when creating the cluster. Replace **BASENAME** with the base name used when creating the cluster.
   
        ssh USERNAME@storm-BASENAME-ssh.azurehdinsight.net
   
    When prompted, enter the password you used when creating the clusters.
   
    For more information on using SSH with HDInsight, see the following documents:
   
   * [Use SSH with Linux-based HDInsight from Linux, Unix, and Mac OS](hdinsight-hadoop-linux-use-ssh-unix.md)
   * [Use SSH with Linux-based HDInsight from Windows](hdinsight-hadoop-linux-use-ssh-windows.md)
2. From the SSH connection to the Storm cluster, use the following commands to install the jq utility on the cluster. This utility makes it much easier to parse the JSON documents for the information we need in the next step.
   
        wget https://github.com/stedolan/jq/releases/download/jq-1.5/jq-linux64
        chmod +x jq-linux64
        mv jq-linux64 /usr/bin/jq
3. Use the following to set the **KAFKATOPIC** and **KAFKABROKERS** environment variables. Replace **BASENAME** and **PASSWORD** with the base name and login password used when creating the clusters.
   
        export KAFKABROKERS=`curl -u admin:PASSWORD -G "https://kafka-BASENAME.azurehdinsight.net/api/v1/clusters/kafka-BASENAME/services/HDFS/components/DATANODE" | jq -r '["\(.host_components[].HostRoles.host_name):9092"] | join(",")'`
        export ZKHOSTS=`curl -u admin:PASSWORD -G "https://kafka-BASENAME.azurehdinsight.net/api/v1/clusters/kafka-BASENAME/services/ZOOKEEPER/components/ZOOKEEPER_SERVER" | jq -r '["\(.host_components[].HostRoles.host_name):2181"] | join(",")'`
   
    For **KAFKABROKERS** and **ZKHOSTS** cURL is used to retrieve wokernode and Zookeeper host name information from Ambari on the Kafka cluster. This information allows the Storm topology to communicate with Kafka on the remote cluster.
   
   > [!NOTE]
   > `export` is used so that these variables are available to processes launched from this SSH session, such as the Storm topology.
   > 
   > 
4. From the SSH connection to the Storm cluster, use the following command to start writing sentences to the `sparktest` topic created earlier:
   
        spark-submit --class com.microsoft.example.KafkaWordProducer KafkaExample-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar $KAFKABROKERS sparktest 3
   
    This will start sending three sentences per second to the `sparktest` topic created earlier.
5. Let the producer run for a bit, then use **Ctrl + C** to exit it. Use the following command to start the consumer:
   
        spark-submit --class com.microsoft.example.KafkaWordCount KafkaExample-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar $ZKHOSTS mygroup sparktest 3
   
    This will start reading from the topic using 3 streams. All streams will be part of the `mygroup` consumer group.
   
    As sentences are read from the topic, output similar to the following is displayed:
   
        -------------------------------------------
        Time: 1477595590000 ms
        -------------------------------------------
        (score,8)
        (two,7)
        (away,4)
        (am,7)
        (with,7)
        (day,4)
        (keeps,4)
        (apple,4)
        (over,5)
        (four,8)
        ...
6. Use **Ctrl + C** to stop the consumer.

## Delete the cluster
[!INCLUDE [delete-cluster-warning](../../includes/hdinsight-delete-cluster-warning.md)]

Since the steps in this document create both clusters in the same Azure resource group, you can delete the resource group in the Azure portal. This removes all resources created by following this document, as well as the Azure Virtual Network and storage account used by the clusters.
