# Monitor, receive, and send events with the Azure Event Hubs connector

To set up an event monitor so that your logic app can detect events, receive events, and send events, 
connect to an [Azure Event Hub](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/event-hubs) 
from your logic app workflow. Learn more about 
the [Azure Event Hubs service](../event-hubs/event-hubs-what-is-event-hubs.md).

## Requirements

* You have to have an existing [Event Hubs](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/event-hubs/) 
namespace and an Event Hub in Azure. Learn 
[how to create your Event Hubs namespace](../event-hubs/event-hubs-create.md). 

* To use [any connector](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/connectors/apis-list) 
in your logic app workflow, you have to create a logic app. Learn how to 
[create a basic logic app](../logic-apps/logic-apps-create-a-logic-app.md).

## Check Event Hubs namespace permissions and find the connection string

For your logic app to access any service, 
you have to create a [*connection*](./connectors-overview.md) 
between your logic app and the service, if you haven't already. 
This connection authorizes your logic app to access data.
For your logic app to access your Event Hub, 
you have to have **Manage** permissions and the connection string for your Event Hubs namespace.

To check your permissions and find the connection string, 
follow these steps in the Azure portal.

1.  Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com "Azure portal"). 

2.  Go to your Event Hubs *namespace*, not the specific Event Hub. 
Check that you have **Manage** permissions for that namespace. 
On the namespace blade, under **Settings**, choose **Shared access policies**, 
and check your **Claims** permissions.

    ![Manage permissions for your Event Hub namespace](./media/connectors-create-api-azure-event-hubs/event-hubs-namespace.png)

6.  To copy the connection string for the Event Hubs namespace, 
choose **RootManageSharedAccessKey**. Next to your primary key connection string, 
choose the copy button.

    ![Copy Event Hubs namespace connection string](media/connectors-create-api-azure-event-hubs/find-event-hub-namespace-connection-string.png)

    > [!TIP]
    > To confirm whether your connection string is 
    > associated with your Event Hubs namespace or with a specific Event Hub, 
    > check the connection string for the `EntityPath` parameter. 
    > If you find this parameter, the connection string is for a specific 
    > Event Hub "entity", and is not the correct string to use with your logic app.

5.  Now when you add an Event Hubs trigger or action to your logic app, 
and you're prompted for credentials, give your connection a name, 
enter the connection string string that you copied, and choose **Create**.

    ![Enter connection string for Event Hubs namespace](./media/connectors-create-api-azure-event-hubs/event-hubs-connection.png)

    After you create your connection, 
    the connection name should appear in the Event Hubs trigger or action. 
    You can then continue with the other steps in your logic app.

## Start a workflow when your Event Hub receives new events

A [*trigger*](../logic-apps/logic-apps-what-are-logic-apps.md#logic-app-concepts) 
is an event that starts a logic app workflow. To start a workflow
when new events are sent to your Event Hub, follow these steps for adding 
the trigger that detects this event, if you haven't already.

1.  In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com "Azure portal"), 
go to your logic app, and open Logic App Designer.

2.  In the search box for the designer, enter `event hubs` for your filter. 
Select this trigger: **When events are available in Event Hub**

    ![Select trigger for when your Event Hub receives new events](./media/connectors-create-api-azure-event-hubs/find-event-hubs-trigger.png)

    If you don't already have a connection to your Event Hubs namespace, 
    you're prompted to create this connection now by giving the connection a name,
    and entering the connection string for your Event Hubs namespace. 
    If necessary, learn [how to find your connection string](#permissions-connection-string).

    After you create the connection, 
    the settings for the **When an event in available in an Event Hub** trigger appear.

    ![Trigger settings for when your Event Hub receives new events](./media/connectors-create-api-azure-event-hubs/event-hubs-trigger.png)

3.  Enter or select the name for the Event Hub that you want to monitor. 
Or to optionally select a consumer group for reading events, 
choose **Show advanced options**.

    ![Specify Event Hub or consumer group](./media/connectors-create-api-azure-event-hubs/event-hubs-trigger-details.png)

    You've now set up a trigger to start your logic app. 
    When new events are available in the specified Event Hub, 
    the trigger runs other actions or triggers in your logic app workflow.

## Send events to your Event Hub from your logic app

An [*action*](../logic-apps/logic-apps-what-are-logic-apps.md#logic-app-concepts) 
is a task performed by your logic app workflow. Now that you added a trigger, 
you can perform operations with the data that's generated by the trigger. 
To send an event to your Event Hub from your logic app, 
follow these steps for adding the action that performs this task.

1.  In your logic app, under your trigger, 
choose **New step** > **Add an action**.

    ![Choose "New Step", then "Add an action"](./media/connectors-create-api-azure-event-hubs/add-action.png)

    Now you can find and select an action to perform. 
    Although you can select any action, for this example, 
    we want the Event Hubs action to send events.

2.  In the search box, enter `event hubs` for your filter.
Select this action: **Send event**

    ![Select "Event Hubs - Send event" action](./media/connectors-create-api-azure-event-hubs/find-event-hubs-action.png)

3.  Enter the required details for the event, 
such as the name for the Event Hub where you want to send the event. 
Enter any other optional details about the event, such as content for that event.

    ![Enter Event Hub name and optional event details](./media/connectors-create-api-azure-event-hubs/event-hubs-send-event-action.png)

6.  Save your changes.

    ![Save your logic app](./media/connectors-create-api-azure-event-hubs/save-logic-app.png)

    You've now set up an action to send events from your logic app.
