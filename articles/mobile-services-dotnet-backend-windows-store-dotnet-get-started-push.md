This topic shows you how to use Windows Azure .Net runtime Mobile Services to send push notifications to a Windows Store app. 
In this tutorial you enable push notifications using Windows Azure Notification Hubs to the quickstart project. When complete, your .Net runtime mobile service will send a push notification using Notification Hubs each time a record is inserted. The notification hub that you create is free with your mobile service, can be managed independent of the mobile service, and can be used by other applications and services.

>[WACOM.NOTE] For guidance on how to use the legacy support for push notifications, see [this version of the topic](/en-us/documentation/articles/mobile-services-windows-store-dotnet-get-started-push/).

This tutorial walks you through these basic steps to enable push notifications:

1. [Register your app with WNS and configure Mobile Services](#register)
2. [Update the app to register for notifications](#update-app)
3. [Update the server to send push notifications](#update-server)
3. [Insert data to receive push notifications](#test)

This tutorial is based on the Mobile Services quickstart. Before you start this tutorial, you must first complete either [Get started with Mobile Services] or [Get started with data] to connect your project to the mobile service. When a mobile service has not been connected, the Add Push Notification wizard creates this connection for you. 

##<a id="register"></a> Register your app with WNS and configure Mobile Services

[WACOM.INCLUDE [mobile-services-javascript-backend-register-windows-store-app](../includes/mobile-services-javascript-backend-register-windows-store-app.md)]

Both your mobile service and your app are now configured to work with WNS and Notification Hubs. Next, you will update your Windows Store app to register for notifications.

##<a id="update-app"></a> Update the app to register for notifications

Before your app can receive push notifications, you must register a notification channel.

1. In Visual Studio, open the file App.xaml.cs and add the following `using` statements:

        using Windows.Networking.PushNotifications;
		using Windows.UI.Popups;

2. Add the following `InitNotificationAsync` method to **App** class to create a push notification channel and register for push notifications: 
	
        private async void InitNotificationsAsync()
        {
            // Request a push notification channel.
            var channel =
                await PushNotificationChannelManager
                    .CreatePushNotificationChannelForApplicationAsync();

            // Register for notifications using the new channel
            var notification = MobileService.GetPush();
            string message = "Registation completed";
            try
            {
                await notification.RegisterNativeAsync(channel.Uri);
            }
            catch (MobileServiceInvalidOperationException mob_ex)
            {
                message = mob_ex.Message;
            }

            var dialog = new MessageDialog(message, "Registering Channel URI");
            dialog.Commands.Add(new UICommand("OK"));
            await dialog.ShowAsync();
        }

    This code retrieves the ChannelURI for the app from WNS, and then registers that ChannelURI for push notifications.
    
4. At the top of the **OnLaunched** event handler in App.xaml.cs, add the following call to the new **InitNotificationsAsync** method:

        InitNotificationsAsync();

	This makes sure that registration is requested every time that the page is loaded. In your app, you may only want to make this registration periodically to ensure that the registration is current. 

5. Press the **F5** key to run the app. A popup dialog with the registration key is displayed.
  
6. In Visual Studio, open the Package.appxmanifest file and make sure that **Toast capable** is set to **Yes** on the **Application UI** tab. Save the file.

   	![][1]

   	This makes sure that your app can raise toast notifications. 

##<a id="update-server"></a> Update the server to send push notifications


1. In Visual Studio, open TodoItemController.cs and update the following code for the `PostTodoItem` method definition so that it will send the push notification on inserting a todo item.

        public async Task<IHttpActionResult> PostTodoItem(TodoItem item)
        {
            TodoItem current = await InsertAsync(item);
            WindowsPushMessage message = new WindowsPushMessage();
            message.XmlPayload = @"<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""utf-8""?><toast><visual>     
                                    <binding template=""ToastText01"">  <text id=""1"">" +
                                        item.Text + @"</text></binding></visual></toast>";
            var result = await Services.Push.SendAsync(message);
            Services.Log.Info(result.State.ToString());
            return CreatedAtRoute("Tables", new { id = current.Id }, current);
        }

    This code sends a push notification (with the text of the inserted item) to all Windows Store app registrations after the insert succeeds.

##<a id="test"></a> Test push notifications in your app

1. In Visual Studio, press the F5 key to run the app.

2. In the app, type text in **Insert a TodoItem**, and then click **Save**.

   	![][2]

   	Note that after the insert completes, the app receives a push notification from WNS.
