# Add push notifications to your Mobile Services app

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-selector-get-started-push-legacy](../includes/mobile-services-selector-get-started-push-legacy.md)]

This topic shows you how to use Azure Mobile Services with a .NET backend to send push notifications to a universal Windows app. In this tutorial you enable push notifications using Azure Notification Hubs to the univeral Windows quickstart project. When complete, your mobile service will send a push notification from the .NET backend using Notification Hubs each time a record is inserted. The notification hub that you create is free with your mobile service, can be managed independent of the mobile service, and can be used by other applications and services.

>[AZURE.NOTE]This topic shows you how to manually configure push notifications using Windows Notification Service (WNS) for a Windows Store app. You can use Visual Studio 2013 tools to automatically configure the same push notifications in a Windows app project. For more information, see the [universal Windows app version](/en-us/documentation/articles/mobile-services-dotnet-backend-windows-universal-dotnet-get-started-push) of this tutorial.

This tutorial walks you through these basic steps to enable push notifications:

1. [Register your app with WNS and configure Mobile Services](#register)
2. [Update the app to register for notifications](#update-app)
3. [Update the server to send push notifications](#update-server)
4. [Enable push notifications for local testing](#local-testing)
3. [Insert data to receive push notifications](#test)

This tutorial is based on the Mobile Services quickstart. Before you start this tutorial, you must first complete either [Get started with Mobile Services] or [Get started with data] to connect your project to the mobile service. 

>[AZURE.NOTE]This topic supports Windows Phone Store 8.1 apps. To add push notifications to a Windows Phone 8 or Windows Phone Silverlight 8.1 app, see this version of [Get started with push notifications in Mobile Services](/en-us/documentation/articles/mobile-services-dotnet-backend-windows-phone-get-started-push).

##<a id="register"></a> Register your app with WNS and configure Mobile Services

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-notification-hubs-register-windows-store-app](../includes/mobile-services-notification-hubs-register-windows-store-app.md)]

Both your mobile service and your apps are now configured to work with WNS and Notification Hubs. Next, you will update your universal Windows app to register for notifications.

##<a id="update-app"></a> Update the app to register for notifications

Before your app can receive push notifications, you must register a notification channel.

1. In Visual Studio, open the file App.xaml.cs and add the following `using` statements:

        using Windows.Networking.PushNotifications;
		using Windows.UI.Popups;

2. Add the following `InitNotificationAsync` method to **App** class to create a push notification channel and register for push notifications: 
	
        private async void InitNotificationsAsync()
        {
            // Request a push notification channel.
            var channel = await PushNotificationChannelManager
                .CreatePushNotificationChannelForApplicationAsync();

            // Register for notifications using the new channel
            System.Exception exception = null;
            try
            {
                await MobileService.GetPush().RegisterNativeAsync(channel.Uri);
            }
            catch (System.Exception ex)
            {
                exception = ex;
            }
            if (exception != null)
            {
                var dialog = new MessageDialog(exception.Message, "Registering Channel URI");
                dialog.Commands.Add(new UICommand("OK"));
                await dialog.ShowAsync();
            }
        }


    This code retrieves the ChannelURI for the app from WNS, and then registers that ChannelURI for push notifications.
    
3. At the top of the **OnLaunched** event handler in App.xaml.cs, add the following call to the new **InitNotificationsAsync** method:

        InitNotificationsAsync();

	This makes sure that registration is requested every time that the page is loaded. In your app, you may only want to make this registration periodically to ensure that the registration is current. 

4. In Visual Studio, open the Package.appxmanifest file and make sure that **Toast capable** is set to **Yes** on the **Application UI** tab. Save the file.

   	![][1]

   	This makes sure that your app can raise toast notifications.
