# Add Application Insights to an existing web project

*Application Insights is in preview.*

Find out what users are doing with your web application, so that you can better tune it to their needs. Make sure it's constantly available and performing well. Application Insights will alert you to any issues and help you find and diagnose the root causes.

Application Insights can monitor live and in-development web applications, hosted on-premise or on virtual machines, as well as Microsoft Azure websites.

You'll need <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=397827">Visual Studio Update 3</a>.

![Get code from Quick Start](./media/appinsights/appinsights-06webcode.png)

In Visual Studio, put the code in each web page that you want to monitor, immediately before the closing &lt;/head&gt; tag. In an ASP.NET app, a way to do that is to insert it in the Views/Shared/_Layout page.

Notice that the snippet contains the id of this application resource, so if you have several applications, you can't reuse the same snippet.



## <a name="run"></a>3. Run your project

Run your application with F5 and try it out.

## <a name="monitor"></a>4. See monitor data


**Close and re-open your application's home blade**, and look for data in the Application health and Usage analytics tiles. For example:

![Click through to more data](./media/appinsights/appinsights-05-usageTiles.png)
