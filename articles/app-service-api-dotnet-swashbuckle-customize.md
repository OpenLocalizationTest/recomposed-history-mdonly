# Customize Swashbuckle-generated operation identifiers 

## Overview

Swashbuckle generates Swagger operation identifiers by concatenating controller name and method name. This pattern creates a problem when you have multiple overloads of a method: Swashbuckle  generates duplicate operation ids, which is invalid Swagger JSON.

For example, the following controller code causes Swashbuckle to generate three Contact_Get operation ids.

You can solve the problem manually by giving the methods unique names, such as the following for this example:

* Get
* GetById
* GetPage

The alternative is to extend Swashbuckle to make it automatically generate unique operation ids. This article shows how to do that.

## Extend Swashbuckle 

The following steps show how to customize Swashbuckle by using the *SwaggerConfig.cs* file that is included in the project by the Visual Studio API Apps Preview project template.  You can also customize Swashbuckle in a Web API project that you configure for deployment as an API app.

1. Create a custom `IOperationFilter` implementation 

	The `IOperationFilter` interface provides an extensibility point for Swashbuckle users who want to customize various aspects of the Swagger metadata process. The following code demonstrates one method of changing the operation-id-generation behavior. The code appends parameter names to the operation id name.  

		using Swashbuckle.Swagger;
		using System.Web.Http.Description;
		
		namespace ContactsList
		{
		    public class MultipleOperationsWithSameVerbFilter : IOperationFilter
		    {
		        public void Apply(
		            Operation operation,
		            SchemaRegistry schemaRegistry,
		            ApiDescription apiDescription)
		        {
		            if (operation.parameters != null)
		            {
		                operation.operationId += "By";
		                foreach (var parm in operation.parameters)
		                {
		                    operation.operationId += string.Format("{0}",parm.name);
		                }
		            }
		        }
		    }
		}

2. In *App_Start\SwaggerConfig.cs* file, call the `OperationFilter` method to cause Swashbuckle to use the new `IOperationFilter` implementation.

		c.OperationFilter<MultipleOperationsWithSameVerbFilter>();

	The *SwaggerConfig.cs* file that is dropped in by the Swashbuckle NuGet package contains many commented-out examples of extensibility points. The additional comments are not shown here. 

	After you make this change, your `IOperationFilter` implementation is used and causes unique operation ids to be generated.
