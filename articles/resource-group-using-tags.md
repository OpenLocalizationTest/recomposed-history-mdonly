# Using tags to organize your Azure resources

Resource Manager enables you to logically organize resources by applying tags. The tags consist of key/value pairs that identify resources with properties that you define. To mark resources as belonging to the same category, apply the same tag to those resources.

When you view resources with a particular tag, you see resources from all of your resource groups. You are not limited to only resources in the same resource group which enables you to organize your resources in a way that is independent of the deployment relationships. Tags can be particularly helpful when you need to organize resources for billing or management.

Each tag you add to a resource or resource group is automatically added to the subscription-wide taxonomy. You can also prepopulate the taxonomy for your subscription with tag names and values you'd like to use as resources are tagged in the future.

Each resource or resource group can have a maximum of 15 tags. The tag name is limited to 512 characters, and the tag value is limited to 256 characters.

> [AZURE.NOTE] You can only apply tags to resources that support Resource Manager operations. If you created a Virtual Machine, Virtual Network, or Storage through the classic deployment model (such as through the classic portal or Service Management API), you cannot apply a tag to that resource. You must re-deploy these resources through Resource Manager to support tagging. All other resources support tagging.

## Tags in templates

Adding a tag to resource during deployment is very easy. Simply add the **tags** element to the resource you are deploying, and provide the tag name and value. The tag name and value do not need to pre-exist in your subscription. You can provide up to 15 tags for each resource.

The following example shows a storage account with a tag.

    "resources": [
        {
            "type": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts",
            "apiVersion": "2015-06-15",
            "name": "[concat('storage', uniqueString(resourceGroup().id))]",
            "location": "[resourceGroup().location]",
            "tags": {
                "dept": "Finance"
            },
            "properties": 
            {
                "accountType": "Standard_LRS"
            }
        }
    ]

Currently, Resource Manager does not support processing an object for the tag names and values. Instead, you can pass an object for the tag values, but you must still specify the tag names, as shown below.

    {
      "$schema": "http://schema.management.azure.com/schemas/2015-01-01/deploymentTemplate.json#",
      "contentVersion": "1.0.0.0",
      "parameters": {
        "tagvalues": {
          "type": "object",
          "defaultValue": {
            "dept": "Finance",
            "project": "Test"
          }
        }
      },
      "resources": [
      {
        "apiVersion": "2015-06-15",
        "type": "Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts",
        "name": "examplestorage",
        "tags": {
          "dept": "[parameters('tagvalues').dept]",
          "project": "[parameters('tagvalues').project]"
        },
        "location": "[resourceGroup().location]",
        "properties": {
          "accountType": "Standard_LRS"
        }
      }]
    }


## Tags in the portal

Tagging resources and resource groups in the portal is easy. Use the Browse hub to navigate to the resource or resource group youâ€™d like to tag and click the Tags part in the Overview section at the top of the blade.

![Tags part on resource and resource group blades](./media/resource-group-using-tags/tag-icon.png)

This will open a blade with the list of tags that have already been applied. If this is your first tag, the list will be empty. To add a tag, simply specify a name and value and press Enter. After you've added a few tags, you'll notice autocomplete options based on pre-existing tag names and values to better ensure a consistent taxonomy across your resources and to avoid common mistakes, like misspellings.

![Tag resources with name/value pairs](./media/resource-group-using-tags/tag-resources.png)

To view your taxonomy of tags in the portal, use the Browse hub to view Everything and then select Tags.

Pin the most important tags to your Startboard for quick access and you're ready to go. Have fun!

## Tagging with PowerShell

Tags exist directly on resources and resource groups, so to see what tags are already applied, we can simply get a resource or resource group with **Get-AzureRmResource** or **Get-AzureRmResourceGroup**. Let's start with a resource group.

    PS C:\> Get-AzureRmResourceGroup tag-demo-group

    ResourceGroupName : tag-demo-group
    Location          : westus
    ProvisioningState : Succeeded
    Tags              :
                    Name         Value
                    ===========  ==========
                    Dept         Finance
                    Environment  Production


This cmdlet returns several bits of metadata on the resource group including what tags have been applied, if any. 

When getting metadata for a resource, the tags are not directly displayed. You'll see below that the tags are only displayed as Hashtable object.

    PS C:\> Get-AzureRmResource -ResourceName tfsqlserver -ResourceGroupName tag-demo-group

    Name              : tfsqlserver
    ResourceId        : /subscriptions/{guid}/resourceGroups/tag-demo-group/providers/Microsoft.Sql/servers/tfsqlserver
    ResourceName      : tfsqlserver
    ResourceType      : Microsoft.Sql/servers
    Kind              : v12.0
    ResourceGroupName : tag-demo-group
    Location          : westus
    SubscriptionId    : {guid}
    Tags              : {System.Collections.Hashtable}

You can view the actual tags by retrieving the **Tags** property.

    PS C:\> (Get-AzureRmResource -ResourceName tfsqlserver -ResourceGroupName tag-demo-group).Tags

    Name                           Value
    ----                           -----
    Value                          Finance
    Name                           Dept
    Value                          Production
    Name                           Environment

Instead of viewing the tags for a particular resource group or resource, you will often want to retrieve all of the resources or resource groups that have a particular tag and value. To get resource groups with a specific tag, use **Find-AzureRmResourceGroup** cmdlet with the **-Tag** parameter.

    PS C:\> Find-AzureRmResourceGroup -Tag @{ Name="Dept"; Value="Finance" } | %{ $_.Name }
    tag-demo-group
    web-demo-group

To get all of the resources with a particular tag and value, use the **Find-AzureRmResource** cmdlet.

    PS C:\> Find-AzureRmResource -TagName Dept -TagValue Finance | %{ $_.ResourceName }
    tfsqlserver
    tfsqldatabase

To tag a resource group, simply use the **Set-AzureRmResourceGroup** command and specify a tag name and value.

    PS C:\> Set-AzureRmResourceGroup tag-demo -Tag @( @{ Name="project"; Value="tags" }, @{ Name="env"; Value="demo"} )

    ResourceGroupName : tag-demo
    Location          : southcentralus
    ProvisioningState : Succeeded
    Tags              :
                    Name     Value
                    =======  =====
                    project  tags
                    env      demo

Tags are updated as a whole, so if you are adding one tag to a resource that's already been tagged, you'll need to use an array with all the tags you want to keep. To do this, you can first select the existing tags and add a new one.

    PS C:\> $tags = (Get-AzureRmResourceGroup -Name tag-demo).Tags
    PS C:\> $tags += @{Name="status";Value="approved"}
    PS C:\> Set-AzureRmResourceGroup tag-demo -Tag $tags

    ResourceGroupName : tag-demo
    Location          : southcentralus
    ProvisioningState : Succeeded
    Tags              :
                    Name     Value
                    =======  ========
                    project  tags
                    env      demo
                    status   approved


To remove one or more tags, simply save the array without the ones you want to remove.

The process is the same for resources, except you'll use the **Get-AzureRmResource** and **Set-AzureRmResource** cmdlets. 

To get a list of all tags within a subscription using PowerShell, use the **Get-AzureRmTag** cmdlet.

    PS C:/> Get-AzureRmTag
    Name                      Count
    ----                      ------
    env                       8
    project                   1

You may see tags that start with "hidden-" and "link:". These are internal tags, which you should ignore and avoid changing.

Use the **New-AzureRmTag** cmdlet to add new tags to the taxonomy. These tags will be included in the autocomplete even though they haven't been applied to any resources or resource groups, yet. To remove a tag name/value, first remove the tag from any resources it may be used with and then use the **Remove-AzureRmTag** cmdlet to remove it from the taxonomy.

## Tagging with REST API

The portal and PowerShell both use the [Resource Manager REST API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn848368.aspx) behind the scenes. If you need to integrate tagging into another environment, you can get tags with a GET on the resource id and update the set of tags with a PATCH call.


## Tagging and billing

For supported services, you can use tags to group your billing data. For example, [Virtual Machines integrated with Azure Resource Manager](./virtual-machines/virtual-machines-azurerm-versus-azuresm.md) enable
you to define and apply tags to organize the billing usage for virtual machines. If you are running multiple VMs for different organizations, you can use the tags to group usage by cost center.  
You can also use tags to categorize costs by runtime environment; such as, the billing usage for VMs running in production environment.

You can retrieve information about tags through the [Azure Resource Usage and RateCard APIs](billing-usage-rate-card-overview.md) or the usage comma-separated values (CSV) file that you can download from
the [Azure accounts portal](https://account.windowsazure.com/) or [EA portal](https://ea.azure.com). For more information about programmatic access to billing information, see [Gain insights into your Microsoft Azure resource consumption](billing-usage-rate-card-overview.md). For REST API operations, see [Azure Billing REST API Reference](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/1ea5b323-54bb-423d-916f-190de96c6a3c).

When you download the usage CSV for services that support tags with billing, the tags will appear in the **Tags** column. For more details, see [Understand your bill for Microsoft Azure](billing-understand-your-bill.md).

## Next Steps

- You can apply restrictions and conventions across your subscription with customized policies. The policy you define could require that a particular tag be set for all resources. For more information, see [Use Policy to manage resources and control access](resource-manager-policy.md).
