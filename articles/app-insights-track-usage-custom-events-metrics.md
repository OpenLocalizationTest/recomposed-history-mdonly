# Track usage with custom events and metrics

### Coming soon

The Application Insights SDK lets you insert lines of code into your application to monitor user activities, so that you can tune your app to their needs.

We're currently still porting this feature over to the new Application Insights portal in Microsoft Azure. (If you want, you can [see how it works in the old portal](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn481100.aspx).)

However, one thing you can do right now is to [capture and search diagnostic event logs generated with Trace, NLog or Log4Net][diagnostic].
