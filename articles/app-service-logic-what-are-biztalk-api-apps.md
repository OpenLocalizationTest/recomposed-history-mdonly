##What are Connectors and BizTalk API Apps

Azure App Services is built atop a principle of extensibility and common connectivity through API Apps. A *Connector* is a type of API App that is focused on connectivity. Connectors, like any other API App, can be used from Web Apps, Mobile Apps and Logic Apps. Connectors make it easy to connect to existing services and help manage authentication, provide monitoring and analytics and more.

Any developer can create their own API Apps and deploy them privately, or share and monetize them through the marketplace. 

To accelerate developers building solutions with Azure App Services, the Microsoft Azure team have added a number of connectors to the marketplace to satisfy many common scenarios. Furthermore, to extend the reach of App Services to complex and advanced integration scenarios a number of Premium and BizTalk capabilities are also available as API Apps.

###Protocol Connectors
App Services was born of the web and favors communication via HTTP and sharing metadata through open formats like Swagger. Of course, developers need to communicate across a variety of protocols and the Protocol Connectors can bridge the gap and make communicating with Services via FTP, SFTP, POP3/IMAP, SMTP and SOAP services as easy as making a HTTP call.  

###SaaS Connectors
App Servces' SaaS connectors provide a turnkey way to connect your web, mobile and logic apps to some of the biggest names in SaaS today, including: Office 365, SalesForce, Sugar CRM, OneDrive, DropBox, Marketo, even Facebook and many more.

###Premium Connectors 
The Premium Connectors extend the reach of App Services further into the enterprise with connectivity for SAP, Siebel, Oracle, DB2 and more.

###BizTalk API Apps
Building business critical apps requires more than just connectivity. Based on the foundation of Microsoft's industry leading integration platform - BizTalk Server - the BizTalk API Apps provide provide advanced integration capabilities that can be snapped into your Web, Mobile and Logic apps. Including Batching and Debatching, VETR (Validate, Extract, Transform and Route)  and support for EDI formats like X12, EDIFACT and AS2.
