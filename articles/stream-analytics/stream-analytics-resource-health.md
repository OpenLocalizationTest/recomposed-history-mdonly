# Stream Analytics troubleshooting workflow

Troubleshooting cloud services and IoT devices can be difficult due to the number of connections and processes handling a real-time data stream. The goal of the resource health check blade is to help the customer quickly diagnose each asset in a Stream Analytics job.

If the problem is on with a managed service, such as Azure Event Hub availability, customer efforts towards troubleshooting the issue may not produce results and delay problem resolution.  Therefore, the resource health check blade helps ensure that customers do not needlessly spend time troubleshooting issues that they cannot directly fix and need to open a support case to receive assistance.

## Troubleshooting workflow

Resource Health can be seen by clocking on the “Resource Health” blade.

With this in mind the following flow chart should help with making educated decisions on what to look for and when to open a support case.
