# Stream Analytics troubleshooting workflow

Azure Resource Health shows the health of Azure Stream Analytics jobs and provides actionable guidance to troubleshoot problems. The goal of the Resource Health blade is to reduce the time spent in determining if the root of the problem lays inside the application or if it is caused by an event inside the Azure platform.

The resource health check blade helps ensure that customers do not needlessly spend time troubleshooting issues that they cannot directly fix and need to open a support case to receive assistance.

## Troubleshooting workflow

Resource Health can be seen by clocking on the “Resource Health” blade.

With this in mind the following flow chart should help with making educated decisions on what to look for and when to open a support case.
