# Tutorial: Sentiment analysis by using Azure Stream Analytics and Azure Machine Learning #

This tutorial is designed to help you quickly set up a simple Azure Stream Analytics job, with Azure Machine Learning integration. We will use a sentiment analytics Machine Learning model from the Cortana Intelligence Gallery to analyze streaming text data, and determine the sentiment score in real time. This is a good tutorial to help you understand scenarios such as real-time sentiment analytics on streaming Twitter data, analyze records of customer chats with support staff, and evaluate comments on forums, blogs, and videos, in addition to many other real-time, predictive scoring scenarios.

This tutorial offers a sample CSV file with text (Figure 1) as input in Azure Blob storage. The job applies the sentiment analytics model as a user-defined function (UDF) on the sample text data from the blob store. The end result is placed in the same blob store in another CSV file. Figure 2 is a diagram of this configuration. For a more realistic scenario, you can replace Blob storage with streaming Twitter data from an Azure Event Hubs input. Additionally, you could build a [Microsoft Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/) real-time visualization of the aggregate sentiment.

## Prerequisites

The prerequisites for completing this tutorial are as follows:

-	An active Azure subscription.
-	A CSV file with some data in it. You can download the file shown in Figure 1 from [GitHub](https://github.com/jeffstokes72/azure-stream-analytics-repository/blob/master/sampleinputs.csv), or you can create your own file. This tutorial is written with the assumption that you use the one provided for download on GitHub.

At a high level, in this tutorial you'll do the following:

1.	Upload the CSV input file to Azure Blob storage.
2.	Add a sentiment analytics model from the Cortana Intelligence Gallery to your Azure Machine Learning workspace.
3.	Deploy this model as a web service in the Machine Learning workspace.
4.	Create a Stream Analytics job that calls this web service as a function, to determine sentiment for the text input.
5.	Start the Stream Analytics job and observe the output.

## Upload the CSV input file to Blob storage

For this step, you can use any CSV file, such as the one already specified as available for download on GitHub. You can use [Azure Storage Explorer](http://storageexplorer.com/) or Visual Studio to upload the file, or you can use custom code. This tutorial uses examples based on Visual Studio.

1.	In Visual Studio, choose **Azure** > **Storage** > **Attach External Storage**. Enter an **Account Name** and **Account Key**.  

    ![Stream Analytics Machine Learning tutorial, Server Explorer](./media/stream-analytics-machine-learning-integration-tutorial/stream-analytics-machine-learning-integration-tutorial-server-explorer.png)  

2.	Expand the storage you attached in step 1, choose **Create Blob Container**, and then enter a logical name. After you create the container, open it to view its contents. (It will be empty at this point).  

    ![Stream Analytics Machine Learning tutorial, create blob](./media/stream-analytics-machine-learning-integration-tutorial/stream-analytics-machine-learning-integration-tutorial-create-blob.png)  

3.	To upload the CSV file, choose **Upload Blob**, and then choose **file from the local disk**.  

## Add the sentiment analytics model from the Cortana Intelligence Gallery

1.	Download the [predictive sentiment analytics model](https://gallery.cortanaintelligence.com/Experiment/Predictive-Mini-Twitter-sentiment-analysis-Experiment-1) from the Cortana Intelligence Gallery.  
2.	In Machine Learning Studio, choose **Open in Studio**.  

    ![Stream Analytics Machine Learning tutorial, open Machine Learning Studio](./media/stream-analytics-machine-learning-integration-tutorial/stream-analytics-machine-learning-integration-tutorial-open-ml-studio.png)  

3.	Sign in to go to the workspace. Choose the location that best suits your own location.
4.	Choose **Run** at the bottom of the page.  
5.	After the process runs successfully, choose **Deploy Web Service**.
6.	The sentiment analytics model is ready to use. To validate, choose the **Test** button and provide text input, such as, “I love Microsoft.” The test should return a result similar to the following:

`'Predictive Mini Twitter sentiment analysis Experiment' test returned ["4","0.715057671070099"]...`

In the **Apps** column, choose the link for **Excel 2010 or earlier workbook** to get your API key and the URL that you’ll need later to set up the Stream Analytics job. (This step is required only to use a Machine Learning model from another Azure account workspace. This tutorial assumes this is the case, to address that scenario.)  

Note the web service URL and access key from the downloaded Excel file, as shown below:  

![Stream Analytics Machine Learning tutorial, quick glance](./media/stream-analytics-machine-learning-integration-tutorial/stream-analytics-machine-learning-integration-tutorial-quick-glance.png)  

## Create a Stream Analytics job that uses the Machine Learning model

1.	Go to the [Azure portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com).  
2.	Choose **New** > **Data Services** > **Stream Analytics** > **Quick Create**. Fill in the **Job Name**, the appropriate **Region** for the job, and choose a **Regional Monitoring Storage Account**.    
3.	After the job is created, on the **Inputs** tab, choose **Add an Input**.  

    ![Stream Analytics Machine Learning tutorial, add Machine Learning input](./media/stream-analytics-machine-learning-integration-tutorial/stream-analytics-machine-learning-integration-tutorial-add-input-screen.png)  

4.	On the first page of the **Add Input** wizard, choose **Data stream**, and then choose **next**. On the next page, choose **Blob Storage** as the input, and then choose **next**.  
5.	On the **Blob Storage Settings** page of the wizard, provide the storage account blob container name you defined earlier when you uploaded the data. Choose **next**. For **Event Serialization Format**, choose **CSV**. Accept the default values for the rest of the **Serialization settings** page. Choose **OK**.  
6.	On the **Outputs** tab, choose **Add an Output**.  

    ![Stream Analytics Machine Learning tutorial, add output](./media/stream-analytics-machine-learning-integration-tutorial/stream-analytics-machine-learning-integration-tutorial-add-output-screen.png)  

7.	Choose **Blob Storage**, and then enter the same parameters, except for the container. The value for **Input** was configured to read from the container named “test” where the **CSV** file was uploaded. For **Output**, enter “testoutput”. Container names must be different. Verify that this container exists.     
8.	Choose **Next** to configure the output’s **Serialization settings**. As with **Input**, choose **CSV**, and then choose the **OK** button.
9.	On the **Functions** tab, choose **Add a Machine Learning Function**.  

    ![Stream Analytics Machine Learning tutorial, add Machine Learning function](./media/stream-analytics-machine-learning-integration-tutorial/stream-analytics-machine-learning-integration-tutorial-add-ml-function.png)  

10.	On the **Machine Learning Web Service Settings** page, locate the Machine Learning workspace, web service, and default endpoint. For this tutorial, apply the settings manually to gain familiarity with configuring a web service for any workspace, as long as you know the URL and have the API key. Enter the endpoint **URL** and **API key**. Choose **OK**.    

    ![Stream Analytics Machine Learning tutorial, Machine Learning web service](./media/stream-analytics-machine-learning-integration-tutorial/stream-analytics-machine-learning-integration-tutorial-ml-web-service.png)    

11.	On the **Query** tab, modify the query as follows, and then choose **Save** to save the query.    

```
	WITH subquery AS (  
		SELECT text, sentiment(text) as result from input  
	)  

	Select text, result.[Score]  
	Into output  
	From subquery  
```    

## Start the Stream Analytics job and observe the output

1.	Choose **Start** at the bottom of the job page.
2.	On the **Start Query Dialog**, choose **Custom Time**, and then choose a time prior to when you uploaded the CSV to Blob storage. Choose **OK**.  

    ![Stream Analytics Machine Learning tutorial, custom time](./media/stream-analytics-machine-learning-integration-tutorial/stream-analytics-machine-learning-integration-tutorial-custom-time.png)  

3.	Go to the Blob storage by using the tool you used to upload the CSV file, for example, Visual Studio.
4.	A few minutes after the job is started, the output container is created and a CSV file is uploaded to it.  
5.	Open the file in the default CSV editor. Something similar to the following should be displayed:

## Conclusion

This tutorial demonstrates how to create a Stream Analytics job that reads streaming text data and applies sentiment analytics to the data in real time. You can accomplish all of this without needing to worry about the intricacies of building a sentiment analytics model. This is one of the advantages of the Cortana Intelligence Suite.

You also can view Azure Machine Learning function-related metrics. To do this, choose the **Monitor** tab. Three function-related metrics are displayed.  

- **Function Requests** indicates the number of requests sent to a Machine Learning web service.  
- **Function Events** indicates the number of events in the request. By default, each request to a Machine Learning web service contains up to 1,000 events.  
- **Failed Function Requests** indicates the number of failed requests to the Machine Learning web service.
