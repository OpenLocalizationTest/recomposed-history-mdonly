# Test an Azure Stream Analytics query in the Azure portal

Azure Stream Analytics allows you to test queries in the Azure portal without needing to start or stop a job.

## Test the input

To test with sample input data, right-click on any of your Inputs and choose to "Upload sample data from file."

Once the upload has completed you can then use the "Test" button to test this query against the sample data you have provided.

The output of your query is displayed in the browser, with a link to Download results should you wish to save the test output for later use. You can now easily and iteratively modify your query and test repeatedly to see how the output changes.

With multiple outputs used in a query you can see the results for both outputs separately and easily toggle between them as well.

Once you are satisfied with the results shown in the browser, you can save your query, start your job, and let it process events without error.
