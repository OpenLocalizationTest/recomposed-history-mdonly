# Application Architecture on Microsoft Azure
-Resources for building applications that use Microsoft Azure. This includes tools to help you draw diagrams to visually describe software systems.

## Design patterns poster
Microsoft patterns & practices has published the book [Cloud Design Patterns](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn568099.aspx), which is available both on MSDN and in PDF download. There is also a large format poster available, which visually lists all the patterns.

## Drawing symbol and icon sets
[View the Visio and symbols training video](http://aka.ms/CnESymbolsVideo) and then [download the Cloud and Enterprise Symbol set](http://aka.ms/CnESymbols) to help create technical materials that describe Azure, Windows Server, SQL Server and more. You can use the symbols in architecture diagrams, training materials, presentations, datasheets, infographics, whitepapers, and even third party books if the book trains people to use Microsoft products. However, they are not meant for use in user interfaces.

The CnE symbols are in Visio, SVG, and PNG format. Additional instructions on how to use easily use the symbols in PowerPoint are included in the set.

The symbol set ships quarterly and is updated as new services are released.

Additional symbols for Microsoft Office and related technologies are available in the [Microsoft Office Visio stencil](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=35772), though they are not optimized for architectural diagrams like the CnE set is.   

Email us at [CnESymbols@microsoft.com](mailto:CnESymbols@microsoft.com) for specific questions and feedback. Weâ€™d like to know what you think, including positive feedback so we know to continue to invest time in them.

## Microsoft architecture certification course
Microsoft created an architecture course in August 2015 supporting Microsoft certification exam 70-534. It's [available for free on EDX.ORG](https://www.edx.org/course/architecting-microsoft-azure-solutions-microsoft-dev205x).  It uses the [3D Blueprint Visio Template](#3d-blueprint-visio-template).

## Microsoft Solutions
Microsoft publishes a set of high-level [solution architectures](http://aka.ms/azblueprints) showing how to build specific types of systems using Microsoft products.

Previously, Microsoft published a set of isometric 3d blueprints showing example architectures. Those blueprints have been replaced by the solution architectures. The blueprint link has been redirected to point to the solutions. If you need access to the previous blueprints materials for some reason, please email [CnESymbols@microsoft.com](mailto:CnESymbols@microsoft.com) with your request.   

The blueprints and solution architectures diagrams both use parts of the [Cloud and Enterprise Symbol Set](http://aka.ms/CnESymbols).

## 3D Blueprint Visio template
The 3D versions of the now defunct [Microsoft Architecture Blueprints](http://aka.ms/azblueprints) were initially created in a non-Microsoft tool. A Visio 2013 (and later) template shipped on August 5, 2015 as part of a [Microsoft Architecture certification course distributed on EDX.ORG](#microsoft-architecture-certification-course).

The template is also available outside the course.

* [View the training video](http://aka.ms/3dBlueprintTemplateVideo) first so you know what it can do   
* Download the [Microsoft 3d Blueprint Visio Template](http://aka.ms/3DBlueprintTemplate)
* Download the [Cloud and Enterprise Symbol Set](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=41937) to use with the 3D template. 

Email us at [CnESymbols@microsoft.com](mailto:CnESymbols@microsoft.com) for specific questions not answered by the training materials or to give feedback. The template is no longer under active development. However, it is still useful and relevant because it can use any PNG or the [Cloud and Enterprise Symbol Set](http://aka.ms/CnESymbols), which are updated.

## Architecture Infographics
Microsoft publishes several architecture-related posters/infographics. They include [Building Real-World Cloud Applications](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/infographics/building-real-world-cloud-apps/) and [Scaling with Cloud Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/infographics/cloud-services/).
