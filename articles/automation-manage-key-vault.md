#Managing Azure Key Vault using Azure Automation

This guide will introduce you to the Azure Automation service and how it can be used to simplify management of your keys and secrets in Azure Key Vault.

## What is Azure Automation?

[Azure Automation](http://azure.microsoft.com/services/automation/) is an Azure service for simplifying cloud management through process automation.  To learn more about Azure Automation see the [Azure Automation getting started guide](automation-create-runbook-from-samples.md).


## How can Azure Automation help manage Azure Key Vault?

Key Vault can be managed in Azure Automation by using the PowerShell cmdlets that are available in the [Azure PowerShell tools](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/jj156055.aspx). Azure Automation has these Key Vault PowerShell cmdlets available out of the box, so that you can perform all of your Key Vault management tasks within the service. You can also pair these cmdlets in Azure Automation with the cmdlets for other Azure services, to automate complex tasks across Azure services and 3rd party systems.
