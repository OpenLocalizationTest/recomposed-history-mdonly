# Monitor your web application 

If you haven't yet [set up your web project for Application Insights][existing], do that now.

Here are the reports you can expect to see on your application's blade in Application Insights. To get to the page from Visual Studio, right-click your web project and choose Open Application Insights. To get to it from the Microsoft Azure Preview start board, choose Browse, Application Insights, and then select your project.

In this preview version, you can't edit the layout or configuration of the tiles.

**Close and re-open the blade periodically to refresh the data, in this version.**

### Average response time

Measures the time between a web request entering your application and the response being returned.

The points show a moving average. If there are a lot of requests, there might be some that deviate from the average without an obvious peak or dip in the graph.

Look for unusual peaks. In general, expect response time to rise with a rise in requests. If the rise is disproportionate, your app might be hitting a resource limit such as CPU or the capacity of a service it uses.

### Requests

The number of requests received in a specified period. Compare this with the results on other charts to see how your app behaves as the load varies.

### Web tests

![](./media/appinsights/appinsights-43webtests.png)

[Web tests] show the results of web requests sent to your server at regular intervals from Application Insights servers around the world.

Check to see if the results vary along with the request count.
