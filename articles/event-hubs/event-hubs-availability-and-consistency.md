# Availability and consistency in Event Hubs
## Overview
Azure Event Hubs uses a [partitioning model](event-hubs-what-is-event-hubs.md#partitions) that allows for greater uptime within a single Event Hub. For example, if an Event Hub has four partitions, and one of those partitions has failed, or been taken offline for updates, you can still send and receive from three other partitions. However, Event Hubs can only guarantee the ordering of messages on a single partition. For this reason, it can be benefical to send and receive events from a specific partition when ordering matters.

To help explain the tradeoff between ordering and availability, we can look to the [CAP theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAP_theorem), also known as Brewer’s theorem. The theorem states that, one must choose between consistency, availability, and partition tolerance. Since Event Hubs is built on top of a partitioned model, you must make a choice between availability and consistency (or ordering).

The theorem defines consistency and availability as the following:
* Consistency – a read is guaranteed to return the most recent write for a given client.
* Availability – a non-failing node returns a reasonable response within a reasonable amount of time (with no errors or timeouts).
* Partition tolerance –the ability of a data processing system to continue processing data even if a network partition failure occurs.

## Partition tolerance

Being built on top of a partitioned model, Event Hubs is highly partition tolerant by design meaning users only need to make decisions regarding availability and consistency.

## Availability
The simplest way to get started with Event Hubs is the default behavior. If you create a new `EventHubClient` and use the send function, your events are automatically distributed between partitions in your Event Hub. This behavior allows for the greatest amount of uptime. 

For use cases that require maximum uptime, this is the preferred model.

## Event ordering
In particular scenarios, the ordering of events can be important. For example, you may want your back-end system to process an update command before a delete command. In this instance, you can either set the partition key on an event, or use a `PartitionSender` to only send events to a certain partition. This ensures that when these events are read from the partition, they are read in order.

With this type of configuration, you must keep in mind that if the particular partition that you are sending to is unavailable, you will receive an error response. As a point of comparison, if you did not have an affinity to a single partition, the Event Hubs service would send your event to the next available partition.

One possible solution to ensure ordering, while also maximizing uptime would be to aggregate events as a part of your event processing application. The easiest way to accomplish this would be to stamp your event with a custom sequence number property. The following is an example of such:

```csharp
// Get the latest sequence number from your application
var sequenceNumber = GetNextSequenceNumber();
// Create a new EventData object by encoding a string as a byte array
var data = new EventData(Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes("This is my message..."));
// Set a custom sequence number property
data.Properties.Add("SequenceNumber", sequenceNumber);
// Send single message async
await eventHubClient.SendAsync(data);
```

The preceding example would send your event to one of the available partitions in your Event Hub, and set the corresponding sequence number from your application. This solution requires state to be kept by your processing application, but would give your senders an endpoint that is more likely to be available.
