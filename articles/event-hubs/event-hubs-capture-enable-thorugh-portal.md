# Enable Event Hubs Capture using the Azure portal

You can configure Capture at the event hub creation time via the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). You enable Capture by clicking the **On** button in the **Create Event Hub** portal blade. You then configure a Storage Account and container by clicking the **Container** section of the blade. Because Event Hubs Capture uses service-to-service authentication with storage, you do not need to specify a storage connection string. The resource picker selects the resource URI for your storage account automatically. If you use Azure Resource Manager, you must supply this URI explicitly as a string.

The default time window is 5 minutes. The minimum value is 1, the maximum 15. The **Size** window has a range of 10-500 MB.

## Adding Capture to an existing event hub

Capture can be configured on existing event hubs that are in Event Hubs namespaces. The feature is not available to older **Messaging** or **Mixed** type namespaces. To enable Capture on an existing event hub, or to change your Capture settings, click the namespace to load the **Essentials** blade, then click the event hub for which you want to enable or change the Capture setting. Finally, click the **Properties** section of the open blade, as shown in the following figure:

## Next steps

You can also configure Event Hubs Capture via Azure Resource Manager templates. For more information, see [Enable Capture using an Azure Resource Manager template](event-hubs-resource-manager-namespace-event-hub-enable-capture.md).
