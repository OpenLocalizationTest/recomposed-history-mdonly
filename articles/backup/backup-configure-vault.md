# Back up a Windows Server or client to Azure
This article covers the procedures you need to do to prepare your environment and back up a Windows Server (or client) to Azure. It also covers things to consider when you're deploying your backup solution. If you're interested in trying Azure Backup for the first time [this article](backup-configure-vault.md) will quickly walk you through that process.

The required steps to prepare your environment and backup Windows to Azure include:

| Step | Name | Details |
| :------: | ---- | ------- |
| 1 | [Create a vault](#create-a-backup-vault) | Create a vault in the [Azure Backup management portal](http://manage.windowsazure.com) |
| 2 | [Download the vault credentials](#download-the-vault-credential-file) | Download the vault credentials that will be used to register the Windows machine with the backup vault |
| 3 | [Install the Azure Backup Agent ](#download-install-and-register-the-azure-backup-agent) | Install the agent and register the server to the backup vault using the vault credentials |
| 4 | [Complete the initial backup](#complete-the-initial-backup) | Complete the initial back up for Windows Server or client files and folders. |

## Before you start
To back up a Windows Server (or client) to Azure, you need an Azure account. If you don't have one, you can create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) in just a couple of minutes.

## Create a backup vault
To back up files and folders from a Windows Server or client you need to create a backup vault in the geographic region where you want to store the data.

### To create a Backup vault

1. Sign in to the [Management Portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com/)

2. Click **New** > **Data Services** > **Recovery Services** > **Backup Vault** and choose **Quick Create**.

3. For the **Name** parameter, enter a friendly name to identify the backup vault. Type a name that contains between 2 and 50 characters. It must start with a letter, and can contain only letters, numbers and hyphens. This needs to be unique for each subscription.

    For the **Region** parameter, select the geographic region for the backup vault. The choice determines the geographic region where your backup data is sent. By choosing a geographic region close to your location, you can reduce network latency when backing up to Azure.

    Click **Create Vault**.

    ![Create vault](./media/backup-configure-vault/demo-vault-name.png)

    It can take a while for the backup vault to be created. To check the status, you can monitor the notifications at the bottom of the portal.

    After the backup vault has been created, you'll see a message saying the vault has been successfully created. The vault is also listed in the resources for Recovery Services as **Active**.

    ![Creating Vault status](./media/backup-configure-vault/recovery-services-select-vault.png)

4. Select the **storage redundancy** option.

    >[AZURE.IMPORTANT] The best time to identify your storage redundancy option is right after vault creation and before any machines are registered to the vault. Once an item has been registered to the vault, the storage redundancy option is locked and cannot be modified.

    If you are using Azure as a primary backup storage endpoint (for example, you are backing up to Azure from a Windows Server), you should consider picking (the default) [geo-redundant storage](../storage/storage-redundancy.md#geo-redundant-storage) option.

    If you are using Azure as a tertiary backup storage endpoint (for example, you are using SCDPM to have a local backup copy on-premises & using Azure for your long term retention needs), you should consider choosing [locally redundant storage](../storage/storage-redundancy.md#locally-redundant-storage). This brings down the cost of storing data in Azure, while providing a lower level of durability for your data that might be acceptable for tertiary copies.

    **To select the storage redundancy option:**

    a. Click on the vault you just created.

    b. On the **Quick Start** page, select **Configure**.

    ![Configure Vault status](./media/backup-configure-vault/configure-vault.png)

    c. Choose the appropriate storage redundancy option.

    You will need to click **Save** if you've selected **Locally Redundant**, since **Geo Redundant** is the default option.

    d. Click **Recovery Services**, in the left navigation pane to return to the list of resources for **Recovery Services**.

## Download the vault credential file
The on-premises machine (Windows Server or Windows client) needs to be authenticated with a backup vault before it can back up data to Azure. The authentication is achieved using *vault credentials*. The vault credential file is downloaded through a secure channel from the Azure portal. The Azure Backup service is unaware of the certificate private key, which does not persist in the portal or the service.

Learn more about [using vault credentials to authenticate with the Azure Backup service](backup-introduction-to-azure-backup.md#what-is-the-vault-credential-file).

### To download the vault credential file to a local machine

1. Click **Recovery Services** in the left navigation pane and select the backup vault that you created.

    ![IR complete](./media/backup-configure-vault/rs-left-nav.png)

2.  On the **Quick Start** page, click **Download vault credentials**.

    The portal will generate a vault credential using a combination of the vault name and the current date. The vault credentials file is used only during the registration workflow and expires after 48hrs.

    The vault credentials file can be downloaded from the portal.

3. Click **Save** to download the vault credentials to the local account's downloads folder, or select **Save As** from the **Save** menu to specify a location for the vault credentials.

    >[AZURE.NOTE] Make sure the vault credential file is saved in a location that can be accessed from your machine. If it is stored in a file share/SMB, check for the access permissions.

## Download, install, and register the Azure Backup agent
After creating the Azure Backup vault and downloading the vault credentials, an agent must be installed on each of your Windows machines (Windows Server or Windows client).

### To download, install, and register the agent

1. Click **Recovery Services**, then select the backup vault that you want to register with a server.

2. On the Quick Start page, click **Agent for Windows Server or System Center Data Protection Manager or Windows client > Save**.

    ![Save agent](./media/backup-configure-vault/agent.png)

3. After the *MARSagentinstaller.exe* download is completed, click **Run** (or double click **MARSAgentInstaller.exe** from the saved location).

4. 	Choose the *installation folder* and *cache folder* required for the agent and click **Next**.

    The cache location you specify must have free space equal to at least 5% of the backup data.

5. You can continue to connect to the internet through the default proxy settings, or if you use a proxy server to connect to the internet, in the **Proxy configuration** screen, check the **Use custom proxy settings** box and enter the proxy server details.

    If you use an authenticated proxy, enter the user name and password details.

    Click **Next**.

6. Click **Install** to begin the agent installation.

    The Azure Backup agent installs .NET Framework 4.5 and Windows PowerShell (if it’s not already installed) to complete the installation.

7. Once the agent is installed, click **Proceed to Registration** to continue with the workflow.

8. In the **Vault Identification** screen, browse to and select the *vault credentials file* you previously downloaded.

    The vault credentials file is only valid for 48 hours (after it’s downloaded from the portal). If you encounter any error in this screen (for example, “Vault credentials file provided has expired”), login to the Azure portal and download the vault credentials file again.

    Ensure that the vault credentials file is available in a location that can be accessed by the setup application. If you encounter access related errors, copy the vault credentials file to a temporary location in this machine and retry the operation.

    If you encounter an invalid vault credential error (for example, “Invalid vault credentials provided") the file is either corrupted or does not have the latest credentials associated with the recovery service. Retry the operation after downloading a new vault credential file from the portal. This error is typically seen if the user clicks the *Download vault credential* option in quick succession. In this case, only the last vault credential file is valid.

9. In the **Encryption setting** screen, you can either *generate* a passphrase or *provide* a passphrase (minimum of 16 characters). Remember to save the passphrase in a secure location.

    Click **Finish**.

    > [AZURE.WARNING] If the passphrase is lost or forgotten Microsoft cannot help in recovering the backup data. The end user owns the encryption passphrase and Microsoft does not have visibility into the passphrase used by the end user. Please save the file in a secure location as it is required during a recovery operation.

    The **Register Server Wizard** registers the server with Microsoft Azure Backup.

10. Once the **encryption key** is set, leave the **Launch Microsoft Azure Recovery Services Agent** checkbox checked and click **Close**.

## Complete the initial backup

The initial backup is comprised of two key tasks: **creating the backup schedule** and **backing up files and folder for the first time**. After completing the initial backup, based on the schedule you define, the backup policy will create backup points that you can use should you need to recover the data.

### Schedule the backup

1. Open the **Microsoft Azure Backup agent** (this will open automatically if you left the **Launch Microsoft Azure Recovery Services Agent** checkbox checked when you closed the **Register Server Wizard** or you can find it by searching your machine for *Microsoft Azure Backup*).

    ![Schedule a Windows Server Backup](./media/backup-configure-vault/snap-in-search.png)

2. In the **Microsoft Azure Backup agent** click **Schedule Backup**.

    ![Schedule a Windows Server Backup](./media/backup-configure-vault/schedule-backup-close.png)

3. On the **Schedule Backup Wizard Getting started** screen, click **Next**.

4. On the **Select Items to Backup** screen, click **Add Items**.

5. Select the files and folders you want to back up and click **Okay**.

6. Click **Next**.

7. On the **Specify Backup Schedule** screen, specify the **backup schedule** and click **Next**.

    You can schedule daily (at a maximum of 3 times per day) or weekly backups.

    ![Items for Windows Server Backup](./media/backup-configure-vault/specify-backup-schedule-close.png)

    >[AZURE.NOTE] Specifying the backup schedule is explained in detail in this [article](backup-azure-backup-cloud-as-tape.md).

8. On the **Select Retention Policy** screen, select the **Retention Policy** for the backup copy.

    The retention policy specifies the duration for which the backup will be stored. Rather than just specifying a “flat policy” for all backup points, you can specify different retention policies based on when the backup is taken. You can modify the daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly retention policies to meet your needs.

     Click **Next**.

9. On the **Choose Initial Backup Type** screen, choose the initial backup type**.

    You can back up automatically over the network, or you can back up offline. The remainder of this article follows the process for backing up automatically. If you prefer to do an offline backup, review this article for additional information on the [offline back up workflow in Azure Backup](backup-azure-backup-import-export.md).

    Leave the **Automatically over the network** option selected and click **Next**.

10. On the **Confirmation** screen review the information and click **Finish**.

11. Once the wizard finishes creating the **backup schedule**, click **Close**.

### Enable network throttling (optional)

The Azure Backup agent provides network throttling. Throttling controls how network bandwidth is used during data transfer. This control can be helpful if you need to back up data during work hours but do not want the backup process to interfere with other internet traffic. Throttling of data transfer applies to back up and restore activities.

1. In the **Backup agent**, click **Change Properties**.

    ![Change properties](./media/backup-configure-vault/change-properties.png)

2. On the **Throttling** tab, select the **Enable internet bandwidth usage throttling for backup operations** checkbox.

    ![Network throttling](./media/backup-configure-vault/throttling-dialog.png)

3. Once you have enabled throttling, specify the allowed bandwidth for backup data transfer during **Work hours** and **Non-work hours**.

    The bandwidth values begin at 512 kilobytes per second (Kbps) and can go up to 1023 megabytes per second (Mbps). You can also designate the start and finish for **Work hours**, and which days of the week are considered work days. The time outside of the designated work hours is considered to be non-work hours.

4. Click **OK**.

### Complete the initial backup

1. In the **Backup agent** click **Back Up Now** to complete the initial seeding over the network.

    ![Windows Server backup now](./media/backup-configure-vault/backup-now.png)

2. On the **Confirmation** screen, review the settings the wizard will use to back up the machine and click **Back Up**.

3. Click **Close** to close the wizard. You can do this before the **backup process** completes and it will continue to run in the background.

After the initial backup is completed,  the *Job completed* status is reflected in the **Azure Backup console**.
