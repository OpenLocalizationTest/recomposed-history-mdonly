This tutorial shows you how to add a cloud-based backend service to a Windows Phone 8 app using Windows Azure Mobile Services. In this tutorial, you will create both a new mobile service and a simple _To do list_ app that stores app data in the new mobile service. The mobile service that you will create uses the supported .NET languages using Visual Studio for server-side business logic and to manage the mobile service. To create a mobile service that lets you write your server-side business logic in JavaScript, see the [JavaScript backend version] of this topic.

A screenshot from the completed app is below:

>[WACOM.NOTE]To complete this tutorial, you need a Windows Azure account that has the Windows Azure Mobile Services feature enabled. If you don't have an account, you can create a free trial account in just a couple of minutes. For details, see <a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial/?WT.mc_id=A30A4DDE2&amp;returnurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.windowsazure.com%2Fen-us%2Fdocumentation%2Farticles%2Fmobile-services-dotnet-backend-windows-phone-get-started%2F" target="_blank">Windows Azure Free Trial</a>. <br />This tutorial requires <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwLink/p/?LinkID=257546" target="_blank">Visual Studio Professional 2013</a>. A free trial version is available.

[WACOM.INCLUDE [mobile-services-dotnet-backend-create-new-service](../includes/mobile-services-dotnet-backend-create-new-service.md)]

## Create a new Windows Phone app

Once you have created your mobile service, you can follow an easy quickstart in the Management Portal to either create a new app or modify an existing app to connect to your mobile service. 

In this section you will create a new Windows Phone 8 app that is connected to your mobile service.

1.  In the Management Portal, click **Mobile Services**, and then click the mobile service that you just created.

2. In the quickstart tab, click **Windows Phone 8** under **Choose platform** and expand **Create a new Windows Phone 8 app**.

   	![][6]

   	This displays the three easy steps to create a Windows Phone app connected to your mobile service.

  	![][7]

3. If you haven't already done so, download and install <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwLink/p/?LinkID=257546" target="_blank">Visual Studio Professional 2013</a> on your local computer or virtual machine.

4. Under **Download and publish you service to the cloud**, click **Download**. 

  	This downloads a solution contains projects for both the mobile service and for the sample _To do list_ application that is connected to your mobile service. Save the compressed project file to your local computer, and make a note of where you save it.

5. Under **Publish your service to the cloud**, download your publish profile, save the downloaded file to your local computer, and make a note of where you save it.

## Test the mobile service on your local computer

[WACOM.INCLUDE [mobile-services-dotnet-backend-test-local-service](../includes/mobile-services-dotnet-backend-test-local-service.md)]

>[WACOM.NOTE]There are additional configuration steps needed to run a Windows Phone app that connects a local service. We don't show how to do this in this topic, but you can learn more in [How to connect to a local web service from the Windows Phone 8 emulator]. 

## Publish your mobile service

[WACOM.INCLUDE [mobile-services-dotnet-backend-publish-service](../includes/mobile-services-dotnet-backend-publish-service.md)]

<ol start="4">
<li><p>In the Windows Phone app project, open the App.xaml.cs file, locate the code that creates a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Windowsazure/microsoft.windowsazure.mobileservices.mobileserviceclient.aspx" target="_blank">MobileServiceClient</a> instance, comment-out the code that creates this client using <em>localhost</em> and uncomment the code that creates the client using the remote mobile service URL, which looks like the following:</p>

        <pre><code>public static MobileServiceClient MobileService = new MobileServiceClient(
            "https://todolist.azure-mobile.net/",
            "XXXXXXX-APPLICATION-KEY-XXXXXXXX");</code></pre>

	<p>The client will now access the mobile service published to Windows Azure.</p></li>

<li><p>Press the <strong>F5</strong> key to rebuild the project and start the app.</p></li>

<li><p>In the app, type meaningful text, such as <em>Complete the tutorial</em>, and then click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>

<p>This sends a POST request to the new mobile service hosted in Windows Azure. Data from the request is inserted into the TodoItem table. Items stored in the table are returned by the mobile service, and the data is displayed in the list.</p>
	<div class="dev-callout"> 
	<b>Note</b> 
   	<p>You can review the code that accesses your mobile service to query and insert data, which is found in the MainPage.xaml.cs file.</p> 
 	</div>
</li>
</ol>

This shows how to run your new client app against the mobile service running in Windows Azure. Before you can test the Windows Phone app with the mobile service running on a local computer, you must configure the Web server and firewall to allow access from your Windows Phone device or emulator. For more information, see [Configure the local web server to allow connections to a local mobile service](/en-us/documentation/articles/mobile-services-dotnet-backend-how-to-configure-iis-express).

## <a name="next-steps"> </a>Next Steps
Now that you have completed the quickstart, learn how to perform additional important tasks in Mobile Services: 

* [Get started with data]
  <br/>Learn more about storing and querying data using Mobile Services.

* [Get started with authentication]
  <br/>Learn how to authenticate users of your app with an identity provider.

* [Get started with push notifications] 
  <br/>Learn how to send a very basic push notification to your app.
