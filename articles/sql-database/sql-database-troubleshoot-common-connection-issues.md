# Troubleshoot common connection issues to Azure SQL Database
Connection issues to Azure SQL database can at a very high level be classified as any of the following errors:

- Transient errors (short-lived or intermittent)
- Persistent or non-transient (always occur) errors

If your application is experiencing transient errors, review the following topics for additional tips about how to troubleshoot and reducing these errors.
- [Troubleshooting Database <x> on Server <y> is unavailable](sql-database-troubleshoot-connection.md)
- [Troubleshoot, diagnose, and prevent SQL connection errors and transient errors for SQL Database](sql-database-connectivity-issues.md)

If the application persistently fails to connect to SQL Azure Database, it usually indicates an issue with one of the following:
- Firewall configuration. The Azure SQL database or client-side firewall doesn’t open for communications to Azure SQL Database.
- Network reconfiguration on the client side. For example, a new IP address or a proxy server.
- User error. For example, mistyped connection parameters, such as server name in the connection string and so on


## Steps to resolve persistent connectivity issues
1.	Set up [firewall rules](sql-database-configure-firewall-settings.md) to allow the client IP address.
2.	On all firewalls between the client and the Internet, make sure that port 1433 is open for outbound connections. Review [Configure the Windows Firewall to Allow SQL Server Access](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc646023.aspx) for additional pointers.
3.	Verify your connection string and other connection settings. See the Connection String section in the [connectivity issues topic](sql-database-connectivity-issues.md).
4.	Check service health in the dashboard. If you think there’s a regional outage, see [Recover from an outage](sql-database-disaster-recovery.md) for steps to recover to a new region.
5.	If connectivity problems continue, file an Azure support request by selecting **Get Support** on the [Azure Support](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/options) site.
