# Monitor and improve performance
Azure SQL Database identifies potential problems in your database and recommends actions that can improve performance of your workload by providing intelligent tuning actions and recommendations.

To review your database performance, use the **Performance** tile on the Overview page, or navigate down to "Support + troubleshooting" section:

   ![View Performance](./media/sql-database-performance/entries.png)

In the "Support + troubleshooting" you can find the following pages:

1. [Performance overview](#performance-overview) to monitor performance of your database. 
2. [Performance recommendations](#sql-database-advisor) to find performance recommendations that can improve performance of your workload.
3. [Query Performance Insight](#query-performance-insight) to find top resource consuming queries.
4. [Automatic tuning](#sql-database-automatic-tuning) to let Azure SQL Database automatically optimize your database.

## Performance Overview
This view provides a summary of your database performance, and helps you with performance tuning and troubleshooting. 

![Performance](./media/sql-database-performance/performance.png)

* The **Recommendations** tile provides a breakdown of tuning recommendations for your database (top three recommendations are shown if there are more). Clicking this tile takes you to **SQL Database Advisor**. 
* The **Tuning activity** tile provides a summary of the ongoing and completed tuning actions for your database, giving you a quick view into the history of tuning activity. Clicking this tile takes you to the full tuning history view for your database.
* The **Auto-tuning** tile shows the auto-tuning configuration for your database (tuning options that are automatically applied to your database). Clicking this tile opens the automation configuration dialog.
* The **Database queries** tile shows the summary of the query performance for your database (overall DTU usage and top resource consuming queries). Clicking this tile takes you to **Query Performance Insight**.

## Performance recommendations
[SQL Database Advisor](sql-database-advisor.md) provides intelligent tuning recommendations that can help improve your database's performance. 

* Recommendations on which indexes to create or drop.
* Recommendations when schema issues are identified in the database.
* Recommendations when queries can benefit from parameterized queries.

## Automatic tuning
Azure SQL Databases can automatically tune database performance by applying performance recommendations. To learn more, read [Automatic tuning article](sql-database-automatic-tuning.md). To enable it, read [how to enable automatic tuning](sql-database-automatic-tuning-enable.md).

## Query Performance Insight
[Query Performance Insight](sql-database-query-performance.md) allows you to spend less time troubleshooting database performance by providing:

* Deeper insight into your databases resource (DTU) consumption. 
* The top CPU consuming queries, which can potentially be tuned for improved performance. 
* The ability to drill down into the details of a query.

* [Azure SQL Database performance guidance for single databases](sql-database-performance-guidance.md)
