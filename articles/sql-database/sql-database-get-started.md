# Create and query your first Azure SQL database in the Azure portal

Azure SQL Databases can be created through the Azure portal. This quick start details the portal deployment experience.

## Create a database

Follow these steps to create a database with sample data in a server and a resource group. 

1. Log in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) and click the **New** button.

2. Select **Databases** from the Marketplace screen, select **SQL databases** from the featured apps screen.

3. Fill out the form with the following information. Click **Create** when compolete:

4. After the deployment has started, the Azure portal will return to the Azure dashboard. From here, the deployment status can be monitored. Provisioning takes a few minutes. 

## Create a server-level firewall rule

Follow these steps to create a server-level firewall rule for your IP address to enable external connectivity to the database and to its server. 

1. Once the SQL database deployment has finished, select the **SQL databases** icon on the Azure dashboard and click the new database, such as **MySampleDB**.

2. Click **Set server firewall** on the toolbar for your database to open Firewall settings page for the server on the Azure dashboard for your server. 

3. Click **Add client IP** on the toolbar and then click **Save** to create a firewall rule for your current IP address.

4. Click **OK** and then **close** the firewall blade.

You can now connect to the database and its server using SQL Server Management Studio or another tool of your choice.

## Query the database

Follow these steps to query the database on the Azure dashboard. 

1. Click **Tools** on the toolbar for your database to open the query editor.

2. Click **Query editor (preview)**, click the preview checkbox, and then click **OK**. 

3. Click **Login** and then, when prompted provide the server admin login and password, and click **OK**.

4. After you are authenticated, type a query, such as the following query in the query window, and then click **Run**.

   ```
   select * from sys.objects
   ```

5. Review the query results in the **Results** pane.

## Troubleshoot connectivity

You receive error messages when the connection to Azure SQL Database fails. The connection problems can be caused by SQL Azure database reconfiguration, firewall settings, connection time-out, or incorrect login information. For a connectivity troubleshooter tool, see [Troubleshooting connectivity issues with Microsoft Azure SQL Database](https://support.microsoft.com/help/10085/troubleshooting-connectivity-issues-with-microsoft-azure-sql-database).

## Delete the database

The steps in this procedure show you how to delete a single database with the Azure portal.

1. On the Azure dashboard page for your database, click **Delete**.

2. Click **Yes** to confirm that you want to delete this database permanently.

> [!TIP]
> During the retention period for your database, you can restore it from the service-initiated automatic backups (provided you do not delete the server itself). For Basic edition databases, you can restore them within seven days. For all other editions, you can restore them within 35 days. If you do delete the server itself, you cannot recover the server or any of its deleted databases. For more information about database backups, see [Learn about SQL Database backups](sql-database-automated-backups.md) and for information about restoring a database from backups, see [Database recovery](sql-database-recovery-using-backups.md). For a how-to article on restoring a deleted database, see [Restore a deleted Azure SQL database - Azure portal](sql-database-restore-deleted-database-portal.md).
