# Create, connect to and query your first Azure SQL databases in the Azure portal

In this tutorial, you learn how to create, connect to and query Azure SQL databases in the Azure portal and using SQL Server Management Studio. When you complete this tutorial, you will:

* Have created a resource group containing a logical server, a server-level firewall rule, and two databases.
* Know how to view server and database properties in the Azure portal and using SQL Server Management Studio.
* Know how to query a database in the Azure portal and using SQL Server Management Studio.

**Time estimate**: This tutorial takes approximately 30 minutes (assuming you already meet the prerequisites).

> [!TIP]
> You can also learn how to create, connect to and query an Azure SQL database using either [PowerShell](sql-database-get-started-powershell.md) or [C#](sql-database-get-started-csharp.md).
>

> [!NOTE]
> This tutorial helps you to learn the content of these learn topics: [SQL Database server overview](sql-database-server-overview.md), [SQL database overview](sql-database-overview.md), and [Overview of Azure SQL Database firewall rules](sql-database-firewall-configure.md). For an overview of the SQL Database service, see ]What is SQL Database?](sql-database-technical-overview.md).
>  

## Prerequisites

* **An Azure account**. You can [open a free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) or [Activate Visual Studio subscriber benefits](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/member-offers/msdn-benefits/).

## Create a new logical SQL server

The steps in this procedure show you how to create a logical server in the Azure portal in the region of your choice. A logical server is the object in which you will create your SQL databases and the object in which you will create firewall rules to permit users to connect throught the Azure SQL Database firewall. 

1. Click **New**, type **sql server**, and then click **ENTER**.

    ![logical sql server](./media/sql-database-get-started/logical-sql-server.png)
2. Click **SQL server (logical server)**.
   
    ![create-logical sql server](./media/sql-database-get-started/create-logical-sql-server.png)
3. Click **Create** to open the new SQL Server (logical server) only blade.

    ![new-logical sql server](./media/sql-database-get-started/new-logical-sql-server.png)
3. In the **Server name** text box, provide a valid name for the new logical server. A green check mark indicates that you have provided a valid name.
    
    ![new server name](./media/sql-database-get-started/new-server-name.png)

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > The fully qualified name for your new server is in the form of: **<your_server_name>.database.windows.net**. You will use this fully qualified server name later in this tutorial to connect to your server and your databases.
    >
    
4. In the **Server admin login** text box, provide a user name for the SQL authentication login for this server. This login is referred to as the server principal login. A green check mark indicates that you have provided a valid name.
    
    ![SQL admin login](./media/sql-database-get-started/sql-admin-login.png)
5. In the **Password** and **Confirm password** text boxes, provide a password for the server principal login account. A green check mark indicates that you have provided a valid password.
    
    ![SQL admin password](./media/sql-database-get-started/sql-admin-password.png)
6. In the **Subscription** drop-down box, select a subscription in which you have permission to create objects.

    ![subscription](./media/sql-database-get-started/subscription.png)
7. Under **Resource group** text box, select **Create new** and then provide a valid name for the new resource group. A green check mark indicates that you have provided a valid name.

    ![new resource group](./media/sql-database-get-started/new-resource-group.png)

8. In the **Location** text box, select a data center in which to create your logical server.
    
    ![server location](./media/sql-database-get-started/server-location.png)
    
    > [!TIP]
    > The checkbox for **Allow azure services to access server** cannot be changed on this blade. You can change this setting on the server firewall blade. For more information, see [Get started with security](sql-database-control-access-sql-authentication-get-started.md).
    >
    
9. Select the **Pin to dashboard** checkbox.

10. Click **Create** to deploy this script to Azure to create your logical server.

    ![create button](./media/sql-database-get-started/create.png)

11. After your server has been created, review the properties of your server that are displayed by default. 

    ![sql server blade](./media/sql-database-get-started/sql-server-blade.png)
12. Click **Properties** to view additional properties of your logical SQL server.

    ![sql server properties](./media/sql-database-get-started/sql-server-properties.png)
13. Copy the fully qualified server name to your clipboard for use a bit later in this tutorial.

    ![sql server full name](./media/sql-database-get-started/sql-server-full-name.png)

## Create a server-level firewall rule

The steps in this procedure showyou how to create a server-level firewall rule in the Azure portal. By default, an Azure SQL Database firewall prevents external connectivity to your logical server and its databases. To enable you to connect to your server, you need to create a firewall rule for the IP address of the computer from which you will be connecting in the next procedure. For more information, see [Overview of Azure SQL Database firewall rules](sql-database-firewall-configure.md).

1. On the SQL server blade, click **Firewall** to open the Firewall blade for your server. Notice that the IP address is displayed for your client computer.

    ![sql server firewall](./media/sql-database-get-started/sql-server-firewall.png)

2. Click **Add client IP** on the toolbar to create a firewall rule for your current IP address.

    ![add client IP](./media/sql-database-get-started/add-client-ip.png)

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can create ae firewall rule for a single IP address or an entire range of addresses. Opening the firewall enables SQL administrators and users to login to any database on the server for which they have valid credentials.
    >

4. Click **Save** on the toolbar to save this server-level firewall rule and then click **OK** to close the Success dialog box.

    ![success](./media/sql-database-get-started/save-firewall-rule.png)

## Connect to the server with SSMS

The steps in this procedure show you how to connect to your SQL logical server using SQL Server Management Studio. SSMS is the primary tool that DBA's use to manage SQL servers and databases.

1. Open SQL Server Management Studio (type **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio** in the Windows search box and click **Enter** to open SSMS).

    ![SQL Server Management Studio](./media/sql-database-get-started/ssms.png)
3. In the **Connect to Server** dialog box, enter your fully qualified server name from the previous procedure, select SQL Server Authentication, and then provide the login and password that your specified during provisioning of your server.

    ![connect to server](./media/sql-database-get-started/connect-to-server.png)
4. Click **Connect** to initiate the connection and open Object Explorer in SSMS.

    ![connected to server](./media/sql-database-get-started/connected-to-server.png)
5. In Object Explorer, expand **Databases**, expand **System Databases**, expand **master** to view objects in the master database.

    ![master database](./media/sql-database-get-started/master-database.png)
6. Right-click **master** and then click **New Query**.

    ![query master database](./media/sql-database-get-started/query-master-database.png)

8. In the query window, type the following query:

   ```select * from sys.objects```

9.  On toolbar, click **Execute** to return a list of all system objects in the master database.

## Troubleshoot connectivity

You receive error messages when the connection to Azure SQL Database fails. The connection problems can be caused by SQL Azure database reconfiguration, firewall settings, connection time-out, or incorrect login information. For a connectivity troubleshooter tool, see [Troubleshooting connectivity issues with Microsoft Azure SQL Database](https://support.microsoft.com/help/10085/troubleshooting-connectivity-issues-with-microsoft-azure-sql-database).

## Delete a single database

Follow the steps in this procedure to delete a single database with the Azure portal.

1. On the SQL databases blade in the Azure portal, click the database that you want to delete. 
2.  for your SQL database, click **Delete**.

    ![delete-database](./media/sql-database-get-started/delete-database.png)
2. Click **Yes** to confirm that you want to delete this database permanently.

    ![delete-database-yes](./media/sql-database-get-started/delete-database-yes.png)

> [!TIP]
> During the retention period for your database, you can restore it from the service-initiated automatic backups (provided you do not delete the server itself). For Basic edition databases, you can restore them within seven days. For all other editions, you can restore them within 35 days. If you do delete the server itself, you cannot recover the server or any of its deleted databases.
