# How to: Configure an Azure SQL server firewall using the Azure Portal

Azure SQL server uses firewall rules to allow connections to your servers and databases. You can define server-level and database-level firewall settings for the master or a user database in your Azure SQL server logical server to selectively allow access to the database. This topic discusses server-level firewall rules.

> [AZURE.IMPORTANT] To allow applications from Azure to connect to your Azure SQL server, Azure connections must be enabled. To understand how the firewall rules work, see [How to configure an Azure SQL server firewall \- overview](sql-database-firewall-configure.md). You may have to open some additional TCP ports if you are making connections inside the Azure cloud boundary. For more information, see the **V12 of SQL Database: Outside vs inside** section of [Ports beyond 1433 for ADO.NET 4.5 and SQL Database V12](sql-database-develop-direct-route-ports-adonet-v12.md)

**Recommendation:** Use server-level firewall rules for administrators and when you have many databases that have the same access requirements and you don't want to spend time configuring each database individually. Microsoft recommends using database-level firewall rules whenever possible to enhance security and to make your database more portable.

## Manage existing server-level firewall rules through the Azure portal

Repeat the steps to manage the server-level firewall rules.

- To add the current computer, click Add client IP.
- To add additional IP addresses, type in the Rule Name, Start IP Address, and End IP Address.
- To modify an existing rule, click any of the fields in the rule and modify.
- To delete an existing rule, hover over the rule until the X appears at the end of the row. Click X to remove the rule.

Click **Save** to save the changes.

## Next steps

A server firewall rule affects all SQL Databases on the Azure SQL Server. To configure a database level firewall rule that will affect only a single database instead, see [sp_set_database_firewall_rule (Azure SQL Database)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn270010.aspx").
