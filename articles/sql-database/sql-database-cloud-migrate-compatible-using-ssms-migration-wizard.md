# Migrate compatible SQL Server database using Deploy Database to Microsoft Azure Database Wizard

The Deploy Database to Microsoft Azure Database wizard in SQL Server Management Studio migrates a [compatible SQL Server database](../sql-database-cloud-migrate.md) directly into your Azure SQL logical server instance.

> [AZURE.NOTE] The steps below assume that you have already [provisioned](../sql-database-get-started.md) your Azure SQL logical instance and have the connection information on hand.

1. Verify that you have version 13.0.600.65 or later of SQL Server Management Studio. New versions of Management Studio are updated monthly to remain in sync with updates to the Azure portal.

	 > [AZURE.IMPORTANT] [Use newest version of version of SQL Server Management Studio](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt238290.aspx). It is recommended that you always use the latest version of Management Studio to remain synchronized with updates to Microsoft Azure and SQL Database.

2. Open Management Studio and connect to your source database in Object Explorer.
3. Right-click the source database in the Object Explorer, point to **Tasks**, and click **Deploy Database to Microsoft Azure SQL Databaseâ€¦**

5.	Provide the **New database name** for the database on Azure SQL DB, set the **Edition of Microsoft Azure SQL Database** ([service tier](sql-database-service-tiers.md)), **Maximum database size**, **Service Objective** (performance level), and **Temporary file name** for the BACPAC file that this wizard creates during the migration process.

6.	Complete the wizard to migrate the database. Depending on the size and complexity of the database, deployment may take from a few minutes to many hours. 

	> [AZURE NOTE] If this wizard detects compatibility issues, errors will be displayed to the screen and the migration will not continue. For guidance on how to fix database compatibility issues, go to [fix database compatibility issues](../sql-database-migrate-fix-compatibility-issues.md).

7.	Using Object Explorer, connect to your migrated database in your Azure SQL Database server.
8.	Using the Azure Portal, view your database and its properties.
