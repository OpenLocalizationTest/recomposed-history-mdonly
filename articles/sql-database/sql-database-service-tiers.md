# SQL Database options and performance: Understand what's available in each service tier

[Azure SQL Database](sql-database-technical-overview.md) offers four service tiers: **Basic**, **Standard**,**Premium**, and **Premium RS**. Each service tier has multiple performance levels to handle different workloads. Higher performance levels provide additional resources designed to deliver increasingly higher throughput. You can change service tiers and performance levels dynamically without downtime. Basic, Standard, and Premium service tiers all have an uptime SLA of 99.99%, flexible business continuity options, security features, and hourly billing. The Premium RS tier provides the same performance levels, security features and business continuity features as the Premium tier albeit at a reduced SLA.

You can create single databases with dedicated resources on within a service tier at a specifiec [performance level](sql-database-service-tiers.md#single-database-service-tiers-and-performance-levels). You can also create databases within an [elastic pool](sql-database-service-tiers.md#elastic-pool-service-tiers-and-performance-in-edtus) in which the resources are shared across multiple databases. The resources available for single databases are expressed in terms of Database Transaction Units (DTUs) and for elastic pools in terms of elastic DTUs (eDTUs). For more on DTUs and eDTUs, see [What is a DTU?](sql-database-what-is-a-dtu.md) 

## Choosing a service tier
The following table provides examples of the tiers best suited for different application workloads.

| Service tier | Target workloads |
| :--- | --- |
| **Basic** | Best suited for a small database, supporting typically one single active operation at a given time. Examples include databases used for development or testing, or small-scale infrequently used applications. |
| **Standard** |The go-to option for cloud applications with low to medium IO performance requirements, supporting multiple concurrent queries. Examples include workgroup or web applications. |
| **Premium** | Designed for high transactional volume with high IO performance requirements, supporting many concurrent users. Examples are databases supporting mission critical applications. |
| **Premium RS** | Designed for customers that have IO-intensive workloads but do not require the highest availability guarantees. Examples include testing high-performance workloads, or an analytical workload where the database is not the system of record. |

First decide if you want to run a single database with a defined amount of dedicated resource or if you share a pool of resources acrosss a group of databases. Review the [elastic pool considerations](sql-database-elastic-pool-guidance.md). To decide on a service tier, start by determining the minimum database features that you need:

| **Service tier features** | **Basic** | **Standard** | **Premium** | **Premium RS**|
| :-- | --: | --: | --: | --: |
| Maximum individual database size | 2 GB | 250 GB | 1 TB  | 500 GB  |
| Maximum total storage in an elastic pool | 117 GB | 1200 GB | 750 GB | 750 GB |
| Maximum number of databases per pool | 400  | 400 | 50 | 50 |
| Database backup retention period | 7 days | 35 days | 35 days | 35 days |

> [IMPORTANT]
> Premium RS databases run with a lower number of redundant copies than Premium or Standard databases. So, in the unlikely event of a service failure, you may need to recover your database from a backup with up to a 5-minute lag.
>

Once you have determined the minimum service tier, you are ready to determine the performance level for the database (the number of DTUs). The standard S2 and S3 performance levels are often a good starting point. For databases with high CPU or IO requirements, the Premium performance levels are the right starting point. Premium offers more CPU and starts at 10x more IO compared to the highest Standard performance level.

## Single database service tiers and performance levels
For single databases, there are multiple performance levels within each service tier. You have the flexibility to choose the level that best meets your workloadâ€™s demands using the [Azure portal](sql-database-manage-single-databases-portal.md), [PowerShell](sql-database-manage-single-databases-powershell.md), [Transact-SQL](sql-database-manage-single-databases-tsql.md), C#, and the REST API. 

Regardless of the number of databases hosted, your database gets a guaranteed set of resources and the expected performance characteristics of your database are not affected.

## Scaling up or scaling down a single database

After initially picking a service tier and performance level, you can scale a single database up or down dynamically based on actual experience. If you need to scale up or down, you can easily change the tiers of your database using the [Azure portal](sql-database-manage-single-databases-portal.md), [PowerShell](sql-database-manage-single-databases-powershell.md), [Transact-SQL](sql-database-manage-single-databases-tsql.md), C#, and the REST API.

>

Changing the service tier and/or performance level of a database creates a replica of the original database at the new performance level, and then switches connections over to the replica. No data is lost during this process but during the brief moment when we switch over to the replica, connections to the database are disabled, so some transactions in flight may be rolled back. This window varies, but is on average under 4 seconds, and in more than 99% of cases is less than 30 seconds. If there are large numbers of transactions in flight at the moment connections are disabled, this window may be longer.  

The duration of the entire scale-up process depends on both the size and service tier of the database before and after the change. For example, a 250 GB database that is changing to, from, or within a Standard service tier, should complete within 6 hours. For a database of the same size that is changing performance levels within the Premium service tier, it should complete within 3 hours.

* To downgrade a database, the database should be smaller than the maximum allowed size of the target service tier. 
* When upgrading a database with [Geo-Replication](sql-database-geo-replication-portal.md) enabled, you must first upgrade its secondary databases to the desired performance tier before upgrading the primary database.
* When downgrading from a Premium service tier, you must first terminate all Geo-Replication relationships. You can follow the steps described in the [Recover from an outage](sql-database-disaster-recovery.md) topic to stop the replication process between the primary and the active secondary databases.
* The restore service offerings are different for the various service tiers. If you are downgrading you may lose the ability to restore to a point in time, or have a lower backup retention period. For more information, see [Azure SQL Database Backup and Restore](sql-database-business-continuity.md).
* The new properties for the database are not applied until the changes are complete.

## Elastic pool service tiers and performance in eDTUs

Pools allow databases to share and consume eDTU resources without needing to assign a specific performance level to each database in the pool. For example, a single database in a Standard pool can go from using 0 eDTUs to the maximum database eDTU you set up when you configure the pool. Pools allow multiple databases with varying workloads to efficiently use eDTU resources available to the entire pool. See [Price and performance considerations for an elastic pool](sql-database-elastic-pool-guidance.md) for details.

The following table describes the characteristics of pool service tiers.

[!INCLUDE [SQL DB service tiers table for elastic pools](../../includes/sql-database-service-tiers-table-elastic-pools.md)]

Each database within a pool also adheres to the single database characteristics for that tier. For example, the Basic pool has a limit for max sessions per pool of 4800 - 28800, but an individual database within a Basic pool has a database limit of 300 sessions.

## Scaling up or scaling down an elastic pool

After initially picking a service tier and performance level, you can scale the elastic pool up or down dynamically based on actual experience. 

* Changing the min eDTUs per database or max eDTUs per database typically completes in five minutes or less.
* Time to change the pool size (eDTUs) depends on the combined size of all databases in the pool. Changes average 90 minutes or less per 100 GB. For example, if the total space of all databases in the pool is 200 GB, then the expected latency for changing the pool eDTU per pool is 3 hours or less.

For detailed steps, see [Managing elastic pools with the Azure portal](sql-database-elastic-pool-manage-portal.md), [Managing elastic pools with Powershell](sql-database-elastic-pool-manage-powershell.md), [Managing elastic pools with Transact-SQL](sql-database-elastic-pool-manage-tsql.md), or [Managing elastic pools with C#](sql-database-elastic-pool-manage-csharp.md).
