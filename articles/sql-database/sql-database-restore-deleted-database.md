# Overview: Restore a deleted Azure SQL database

- [PowerShell](sql-database-restore-deleted-database-powershell.md)

You can restore a deleted database during the retenion period for the [SQL Database automated backups](sql-database-automated-backups.md). You can use the [Azure portal](sql-database-restore-deleted-database-portal.md), [PowerShell](sql-database-restore-deleted-database-powershell.md) or the [REST API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/mt163685.aspx). 

If you delete a database the final backup is retained for the normal retention period allowing you to restore the database to the point at which it was deleted. 

## Restoring a Recently Deleted Database

For deleted databases the restore point is fixed to the deletion time of the database. When restoring a deleted database, it can only be restored to the server that contained the original database. Be mindful of this when deleting a server as you will not be able to restore databases previously located on that server once it is deleted. 

> [AZURE.IMPORTANT] If you delete an Azure SQL Database server instance, all of its databases are also deleted and cannot be recovered. 

## Summary

Automatic backups protect your databases from accidental database deletion. This zero-cost zero-admin solution is available with all SQL databases.
