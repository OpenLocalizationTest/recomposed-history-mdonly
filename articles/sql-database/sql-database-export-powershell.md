# Archive an Azure SQL database to a BACPAC file by using PowerShell

> [AZURE.SELECTOR]
- [Azure portal](sql-database-export.md)
- [PowerShell](sql-database-export-powershell.md)


This article provides directions for archiving your Azure SQL database to a [BACPAC](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ee210546.aspx#Anchor_4) file stored in Azure Blob storage. This article shows how you can do this by using PowerShell.

When you need to create an archive of an Azure SQL database, you can export the database schema and data to a BACPAC file. A BACPAC file is simply a ZIP file with an extension of .bacpac. A BACPAC file can later be stored in Azure Blob storage or in local storage in an on-premises location. It can also be imported back into Azure SQL Database or into a SQL Server installation on-premises.

**Considerations**

- For an archive to be transactionally consistent, you must ensure either that no write activity is occurring during the export, or that you are exporting from a [transactionally consistent copy](sql-database-copy.md) of your Azure SQL database.
- The maximum size of a BACPAC file archived to Azure Blob storage is 200 GB. To archive a larger BACPAC file to local storage, use the [SqlPackage](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh550080.aspx) command-prompt utility. This utility ships with both Visual Studio and SQL Server. You can also [download](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt204009.aspx) the latest version of SQL Server Data Tools to get this utility.
- Archiving to Azure premium storage by using a BACPAC file is not supported.
- If the export operation exceeds 20 hours, it may be canceled. To increase performance during export, you can:
 - Temporarily increase your service level.
 - Cease all read and write activity during the export.
 - Use a clustered index on all large tables. Without clustered indexes, an export may fail if it takes longer than 6-12 hours. This is because the export service needs to complete a table scan to try to export the entire table.

> [AZURE.NOTE] BACPACs are not intended to be used for backup and restore operations. Azure SQL Database automatically creates backups for every user database. For details, see [SQL Database automated backups](sql-database-automated-backups.md).

To complete this article, you need the following:

- An Azure subscription.
- An Azure SQL database.
- An [Azure Standard Storage account](../storage/storage-create-storage-account.md), with a blob container to store the BACPAC in standard storage.


[AZURE.INCLUDE [Start your PowerShell session](../../includes/sql-database-powershell.md)]


## Set up the variables for your specific environment

There are a few variables where you need to replace the example values with the specific values for your database and storage account.

Replace the following with your specific values:

    $ResourceGroupName = "resourceGroupName"
    $ServerName = "servername"
    $DatabaseName = "databasename"


In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), browse to your storage account to get these values. You can find the primary access key by clicking **All settings** and then **Keys** from your storage account's blade.

    $StorageName = "storageaccountname"
    $StorageKeyType = "storageKeyType"
    $StorageUri = "http://storageaccountname.blob.core.windows.net/containerName/filename.bacpac"
    $StorageKey = "primaryaccesskey"


Running the **Get-Credential** cmdlet opens a window asking for your user name and password. Enter the admin sign in and password for your SQL server (not the user name and password for your Azure account).

    $credential = Get-Credential

## Export your database

This command submits an export database request to the service. Depending on the size of your database, the export operation may take some time to complete.

> [AZURE.IMPORTANT] To guarantee a transactionally consistent BACPAC file, you should first [create a copy of your database](sql-database-copy-powershell.md), and then export the database copy.


    $exportRequest = New-AzureRmSqlDatabaseExport –ResourceGroupName  $ResourceGroupName –ServerName $ServerName –DatabaseName $DatabaseName –StorageKeytype $StorageKeyType –StorageKey $StorageKey StorageUri $StorageUri –AdministratorLogin $credential.UserName –AdministratorPassword $credential.Password


## Monitor the progress of the export operation

After running **New-AzureRmSqlDatabaseExport**, you can check the status of the request. Running this immediately after the request usually returns **Status : Pending** or **Status : Running**. Run this multiple times until you see **Status : Completed** in the output.

Running this command will prompt you for a password. Enter the admin password for your SQL server.


    Get-AzureRmSqlDatabaseImportExportStatus -OperationStatusLink $exportRequest .OperationStatusLink



## Export SQL database PowerShell script


    $ServerName = "servername"
    $StorageName = "storageaccountname"
    $StorageKeyType = "storageKeyType"
    $StorageUri = "http://storageaccountname.blob.core.windows.net/containerName/filename.bacpac"
    $StorageKey = "primaryaccesskey"

    $credential = Get-Credential

    $exportRequest = New-AzureRmSqlDatabaseExport –ResourceGroupName  $ResourceGroupName –ServerName $ServerName –DatabaseName $DatabaseName –StorageKeytype $StorageKeyType –StorageKey $StorageKey  StorageUri $StorageUri –AdministratorLogin $credential.UserName  –AdministratorPassword $credential.Password

    Get-AzureRmSqlDatabaseImportExportStatus -OperationStatusLink $exportRequest .OperationStatusLink

## Next steps

- Similarly, you may want to create an Azure SQL database by [importing a BACPAC file with PowerShell](sql-database-import-powershell.md).
