# Fix SQL Server database compatibility issues before migration to SQL Database

If you determine that your source SQL Server database is not compatible, you have a number of options to fix the database compatibility issues that you [identified previously](../sql-database-cloud-migrate.md).

## Fix SQL Server database compatibility issues using SQL Azure Migration wizard

Use the [SQL Azure Migration wizard](http://sqlazuremw.codeplex.com/) CodePlex tool to generate a T-SQL script from an incompatible source database that is then transformed by the wizard to make it compatible with the SQL Database and then connect to Azure SQL Database to execute the script. This tool will also analyze trace files to determine compatiblity issues. The script can be generated with schema only or can include data in BCP format. Additional documentation, including step-by-step guidance is available on CodePlex at [SQL Azure Migration wizard](http://sqlazuremw.codeplex.com/).

  > [AZURE.NOTE] Note that not all incompatible schema that can be detected by the wizard can be fixed by its built-in transformations. Incompatible script that cannot be addressed will be reported as errors, with comments injected into the generated script. If many errors are detected, use either Visual Studio or SQL Server Management Studio to step through and fix each error that could not be fixed using the SQL Server Migration Wizard.

## Fix SQL Server database compatibility issues using SQL Server Data Tools for Visual Studio

Use SQL Server Data Tools for Visual Studio ("SSDT") to import the database schema into a Visual Studio database project for analysis. To analyze, you specify the target platform for the project as SQL Database V12 and then build the project. If the build is successful, the database is compatible. If the build fails, you can resolve the errors in SSDT (or one of the other tools discussed in this topic). Once the project builds successfully, you can publish it back as a copy of the source database and then use the data compare feature in SSDT to copy the data from the source database to the Azure SQL V12 compatible database. You can then migrate this updated database. To use this option, download the [newest version of SSDT](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt204009.aspx).

  > [AZURE.NOTE] If schema-only migration is required, the schema can be published directly from Visual Studio directly to Azure SQL Database. Use this method when the database schema requires more changes than can be handled by the migration wizard alone.

## Fix SQL Server database compatibility issues using SQL Server Management Studio

Use SQL Server Management Studio to fix compatibility issues using various Transact-SQL commands, such as **ALTER DATABASE**.

## Next step: Select migration method and perform migration
