# Configure long-term retention of automated backups in an Azure Recovery Services vault 

In this How To topic, you learn how to configure long-term retention of automated backups in an Azure Recovery Services vault.

## Configure long-term retention using the Azure portal

1. Open the **SQL Server** blade for your server.

    ![sql server blade](./media/sql-database-get-started/sql-server-blade.png)

2. Click **Long-term backup retention**.

3. On the **Long-term backup retention** blade, review and accept the preview terms (unless you have already done so - or this feature is no longer in preview).

   ![accept the preview terms](./media/sql-database-get-started-backup-recovery/accept-the-preview-terms.png)

4. To configure long-term backup retention for a database, select that database in the grid and then click **Configure** on the toolbar.

   ![select database for long-term backup retention](./media/sql-database-get-started-backup-recovery/select-database-for-long-term-backup-retention.png)

5. On the **Configure** blade, click **Configure required settings** under **Recovery service vault**.

   ![configure vault link](./media/sql-database-get-started-backup-recovery/configure-vault-link.png)

6. On the **Recovery services vault** blade, select an existing vault, if any. Otherwise, if no recovery services vault found for your subscription, click to exit the flow and create a recovery services vault.

7. On the **Recovery Services vaults** blade, click **Add**.

   ![add new vault link](./media/sql-database-get-started-backup-recovery/add-new-vault-link.png)
   
8. On the **Recovery Services vault** blade, provide a valid name for the new Recovery Services vault.

   ![new vault name](./media/sql-database-get-started-backup-recovery/new-vault-name.png)

9. Select your subscription and resource group, and then select the location for the vault. When done, click **Create**.

   ![create new vault](./media/sql-database-get-started-backup-recovery/create-new-vault.png)

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > The vault must be located in the same region as the Azure SQL logical server, and must use the same resource group as the logical server.
   >

10. After the new vault is created, execute the necessary steps to return to the **Recovery services vault** blade.

11. On the **Recovery services vault** blade, click the vault and then click **Select**.

   ![select existing vault](./media/sql-database-get-started-backup-recovery/select-existing-vault.png)

12. On the **Configure** blade, provide a valid name for the new retention policy, modify the default retention policy as appropriate and then click **OK**.

   ![define retention policy](./media/sql-database-get-started-backup-recovery/define-retention-policy.png)

13. On the **Long-term backup retention** blade, click **Save** and then click **OK** to apply the long-term backup retention policy to all selected databases.

   ![define retention policy](./media/sql-database-get-started-backup-recovery/save-retention-policy.png)

14. Click **Save** to enable long-term backup retention using this new policy to the Azure Recovery Services vault that you configured.

   ![define retention policy](./media/sql-database-get-started-backup-recovery/enable-long-term-retention.png)

14. After long-term backup retention has been enabled, open the **Recovery Services vault** blade (go to **All resources** and select it from the list of resources for your subscription).
