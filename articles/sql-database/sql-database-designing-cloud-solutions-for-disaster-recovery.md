# Designing Cloud Applications for Business Continuity Using Geo-Replication

There are several ways you can take advantage of the SQL Database Geo-Replication feature when designing your application for business continuity. The choice depends on several factors, but the main goal is to optimize it for your specific application. The factors that will guide your design choice include the application deployment topology, the service level agreement you are targeting, traffic latency and costs. In this article we look at the common application patterns and discuss the trade-offs of the different options.

## Design pattern 1: Active-passive deployment for disaster recovery with co-located database

This option is best suited for applications with the following characteristics:

+ active instance in a single Azure region
+ strong dependency on read-write access to data 
+ cross region connectivity between the application logic and the database is not acceptable due to latency and traffic cost    

In this case the application deployment topology is optimized for handling regional disasters when all application components are impacted and need to failover as a unit. For geographic redundancy both the application logic and the database are replicated to another region but not used for application workload under the normal conditions. The application in the secondary region should configured to use a SQL connection string to the secondary database. 

The following diagram shows this configuration before the outage. Traffic manager is configured with a failover profile and directs the user connections to the application instance in the primary region.

> [AZURE.NOTE] [Azure traffic manager](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/traffic-manager-overview/) is used here for illustration purposes only. You can use any load balancing solution. 

After the outage traffic manager detects that connectivity in the primary region failed and switches the user traffic to the application instance in the secondary region. In the meantime you initiate the database failover as soon as the database outage is detected. After failover the application will process the user requests in the secondary region but will remain co-located with the database because the primary database will now be in the same region. This is illustrated by the next diagram.

> [AZURE.NOTE] To detect database outage you can configure an [Elastic database job](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/sql-database-elastic-jobs-overview/) running in the secondary region to check connectivity and responsiveness of the primary database.

The key **advantage** of this approach is that the SQL connection is configured once during the application deployment in each region and it doesnâ€™t change after failover.  The main **tradeoff** is that the redundant application instance in the secondary region is only used for disaster recovery. 

## Design pattern 2: Active-active deployment for application load balancing
This option is best suited for applications with the following characteristics:

+ high ratio of reads to writes
+ write latency does not directly impact the end user experience  
+ the read-only logic can be separated from the read-write logic by using different connection string 
+ the read-only logic does not depend on the data being fully synchronized with the latest version  

If your applications has these characteristics load balancing the end user connections across multiple application instances in different regions can improve performance and end-user experience. To achieve that each region should have an active instance of the application with the read-write (RW) logic connected to the primary database in the primary region. The read-only (RO) logic should be connected to a secondary database in the same region as the application instance. 

> [AZURE.NOTE] Because this pattern requires read-only access to the secondary it can only be implemented using [Active geo-replication](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn741339.aspx). 

Traffic manager should be configured with a performance profile to direct the user connections to the application instance closest to the user's geographic location. The following diagram illustrates this configuration before the outage. 
![Figure 3](./media/sql-database-designing-cloud-solutions-for-disaster-recovery/pattern2-1.png)

After the outage is detected you initiate the database failover to one of the secondary regions. It will change the location of the primary database. Traffic manager will exclude the offline application instance from the routing table but will continue routing the end user traffic to the remaining online instances. Because the primary database is now in a different region all online instances must change the read-write SQL connection string to connect to the new primary. It is important that you make this change prior to initiating the database failover. The read-only SQL connection strings should remain unchanged as they always point to the database in the same region. The following diagram illustrates the new configuration after the failover.
![Figure 4](./media/sql-database-designing-cloud-solutions-for-disaster-recovery/pattern2-2.png)

The key **advantage** of this approach is that you can scale the application logic to any number of instance to achieve the optimal end user performance. The main **tradeoff** is that the traffic between the application instances and database have varying latency and cost. In addition, the application instances must be able to dynamically change the SQL connection string after the database failover.  

> [AZURE.NOTE] A similar approach can be used to offload specialized workloads such as reporting jobs, business intelligence tools and backups. Typically these workloads consume significant database resources therefore it is recommended that you designate one of the secondary databases for them. It may also be necessary to configure this secondary with a higher performance objective to ensure the necessary resources are available. This secondary database should not be shared by the primary application workload. 

## Design pattern 3: Active-passive deployment for data preservation  
This option is best suited for applications with the following characteristics:

+ any data loss is high business risk, the database failover can only be used as a last resort if the outage is permanent
+ the application can operate in "read-only mode" for a period of time 

In this pattern the application relies on the read-only secondary when operating in read-only mode. The application logic in the primary region is co-located with the primary database and operates in read-write mode (RW), the application logic in the secondary region is co-located with the secondary database and is ready to operate in read-only  mode (RO).  

As in the first pattern, traffic manager is configured with a failover profile and directs the user traffic to the active deployment in the primary region. The following diagram illustrates this configuration before the outage. 
![Figure 5](./media/sql-database-designing-cloud-solutions-for-disaster-recovery/pattern3-1.png)

After the outage traffic manager detects the connectivity failure to the primary region and switches the user traffic to the application instance in the secondary region. It is important that you **do not** initiate the database failover after the outage is detected. The application in the secondary region is activated and operates in read-only mode using the secondary database. This is illustrated by the following diagram.

![Figure 6](./media/sql-database-designing-cloud-solutions-for-disaster-recovery/pattern3-2.png)

Once the outage in the primary region is mitigated traffic manager will detect the restoration of connectivity in the primary region and will switch the user traffic back to the application instance in the primary region. That application instance resumes and operates in read-write mode using the primary database. 
> [AZURE.NOTE] Because this pattern requires read-only access to the secondary it can only be implemented using [Active geo-replication](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/dn741339.aspx). 


The key **advantage** of this approach is that it avoids data loss if the outage is temporary. The recovery to the read-only is quick, does not require the database failover and the downtime depends on how quickly traffic manager detects the connectivity failure, which is configurable. The main **tradeoff** is that the application must be able to operate in read-only mode. Resumption of the read-write operations requires the recovery of the primary region, which means the full data access may be disabled for hours or even days. In case of a permanent outage the database failover will be required similar to pattern #1. 

## Summary

Your specific DR strategy can combine or extend these patterns to best meet the needs of your application.  As mentioned earlier, the strategy you choose will be based on the SLA you want to offer to your customers and the application deployment topology. To help guide your decision the table below compares the choices based on the estimated data loss or recovery point objective (RPO) and estimated recovery time (ERT).

| Pattern | RPO | ERT 
| :--- |:--- | :--- 
| Active-passive deployment for disaster recovery with co-located database access | Read-write access < 5 sec | Failure detection time + failover API call + application verification test 
| Active-active deployment for application load balancing | Read-write access < 5 sec | Failure detection time + failover API call + SQL connection string change + application verification test
| Active-passive deployment for data preservation | Read-only access < 5 sec Read-write access = zero |  Read-only access = connectivity failure detection time + application verification test <br>Read-write access = time to mitigate the outage
