# SQL Database tutorial: Create SQL database user accounts to access and manage a database
In this getting-started tutorial, you learn how to use SQL Server Management Studio to work with SQL Server authentication, logins, users, and database roles that grant access and permissions to Azure SQL Database servers and databases. You learn to:

- View user permissions in the master database and in user databases
- Create logins and users
- Grant server-wide and database-specific permissions to users
- Log in to a user database as a non-admin user
- Create database-level firewall rules for database users

**Time estimate**: This tutorial takes approximately 30 minutes to complete (assuming you have already met the prerequisites).

## Prerequisites

* You need an Azure account. You can [open a free Azure account](/pricing/free-trial/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) or [Activate Visual Studio subscriber benefits](/pricing/member-offers/msdn-benefits-details/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F). 

* You must be able to connect to the Azure portal using an account that is a member of either the subscription owner or contributor role. For more information on role-based access control (RBAC), see [Getting started with access management in the Azure portal](../active-directory/role-based-access-control-what-is.md).

* You have completed the [Get started with Azure SQL Database servers, databases, and firewall rules by using the Azure portal and SQL Server Management Studio](sql-database-get-started.md) or the equivalent [PowerShell version](sql-database-get-started-powershell.md) of this tutorial. If not, either complete this prerequisite tutorial or execute the PowerShell script at the end of the [PowerShell version](sql-database-get-started-powershell.md) of this tutorial before continuing.

> [!NOTE]
> This tutorial helps you to learn the content of these learn topics: [Azure SQL Database access and control](sql-database-control-access.md), [Controlling and granting database access](sql-database-manage-logins.md), [Principals](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms181127.aspx), [Database-Level Roles](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms189121.aspx), and [Overview of Azure SQL Database firewall rules](sql-database-firewall-configure.md).

## View information about the security configuration for your logical server

In this section of the tutorial, you view information about the security configuration for your logical server in the Azure portal.

1. Open the **SQL Server** blade for your logical server and view the information in the **Overview** page.

   ![Server admin account in the Azure portal](./media/sql-database-control-access-sql-authentication-get-started/sql_admin_portal.png)

2. Make note of the name of the `Server admin` account for the logical server. If you do not remember the password, click **Reset password** to set a new password.

> [!NOTE]
> To review connection information for this server, go to [View or update server settings](sql-database-view-update-server-settings.md). For this tutorial series, the fully qualified server name is 'sqldbtutorialserver.database.windows.net'.

## Connect to SQL server using SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)

1. If you have not already done so, download and install the latest version of SSMS at [Download SQL Server Management Studio](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt238290.aspx). To stay up-to-date, the latest version of SSMS prompts you when there is a new version available to download.

2. After installing, type **Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio** in the Windows search box and click **Enter** to open SSMS.

   ![SQL Server Management Studio](./media/sql-database-get-started/ssms.png)

3. In the **Connect to Server** dialog box, enter the necessary information to connect to your SQL server using SQL Server Authentication and the Server admin account.

   ![connect to server](./media/sql-database-get-started/connect-to-server.png)

4. Click **Connect**.

   ![connected to server](./media/sql-database-get-started/connected-to-server.png)

## View the Server admin account and its permissions 
In this section of the tutorial, you view information about the server admin account and its permissions in the master database and in user databases.

1. In Object Explorer, expand **Security**, and then expand **Logins** to view the existing logins for your Azure SQL Database server. Notice that a login appears for the `Server admin` account specified during provisioning - the `sqladmin` login for this tutorial series.

   ![Server admin login](./media/sql-database-control-access-sql-authentication-get-started/server_admin_login.png)

2. In Object Explorer, expand **Databases**, expand **System databases**, expand **`master`**, expand **Security**, and then expand **Users**. Notice that a user account has been created in the `master` database for the `Server admin` login, with the same name for the user account as the login (the names do not have to match, but it is a best practice to avoid confusion).

   ![master database user account for server admin](./media/sql-database-control-access-sql-authentication-get-started/master_database_user_account_for_server_admin.png)

   > [!NOTE]
   > For information about the other user accounts that appear, see [Principals](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms181127.aspx).
   >

3. In Object Explorer, right-click **`master`** and then click **New Query** to open a query window connected to the `master` database.
4. In the query window, execute the following query to return information about the user executing the query. Notice that `sqladmin` is returned for the user account executing this query (we will see a different result when we query a user database later in this procedure).

   ```
   SELECT USER;
   ```

   ![select user query in the master database](./media/sql-database-control-access-sql-authentication-get-started/select_user_query_in_master_database.png)

5. In the query window, execute the following query to return information about the permissions of the `sqladmin` user. Notice that `sqladmin` has permissions to connect to the `master` database, create logins and users, select information from the `sys.sql_logins` table, and add users to the `dbmanager` and `dbcreator` database roles. These permissions are in addition to permissions granted to the `public` role from which all users inherit permissions (such as permissions to select information from certain tables). See [Permissions](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms191291.aspx) for more information.

   ```
   SELECT prm.permission_name
      , prm.class_desc
      , prm.state_desc
      , p2.name as 'Database role'
      , p3.name as 'Additional database role' 
   FROM sys.database_principals p
   JOIN sys.database_permissions prm
      ON p.principal_id = prm.grantee_principal_id
      LEFT JOIN sys.database_principals p2
      ON prm.major_id = p2.principal_id
      LEFT JOIN sys.database_role_members r
      ON p.principal_id = r.member_principal_id
      LEFT JOIN sys.database_principals p3
      ON r.role_principal_id = p3.principal_id
   WHERE p.name = 'sqladmin';
   ```

   ![server admin permissions in the master database](./media/sql-database-control-access-sql-authentication-get-started/server_admin_permissions_in_master_database.png)

6. In Object Explorer, expand **`blankdb`**, expand **Security**, and then expand **Users**. Notice that there is no user account called `sqladmin` in this database.

   ![user accounts in blankdb](./media/sql-database-control-access-sql-authentication-get-started/user_accounts_in_blankdb.png)

7. In Object Explorer, right-click **blankdb** and then click **New Query**.

8. In the query window, execute the following query to return information about the user executing the query. Notice that `dbo` is returned for the user account executing this query (by default, the `Server admin` login is mapped to the `dbo` user account in each user database).

   ```
   SELECT USER;
   ```

   ![select user query in the blankdb database](./media/sql-database-control-access-sql-authentication-get-started/select_user_query_in_blankdb_database.png)

9. In the query window, execute the following query to return information about the permissions of the `dbo` user. Notice that `dbo` is a member of the `public` role and also a member of the `db_owner` fixed database role. See [Database-Level Roles](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms189121.aspx) for more information.

   ```
   SELECT prm.permission_name
      , prm.class_desc
      , prm.state_desc
      , p2.name as 'Database role'
      , p3.name as 'Additional database role' 
   FROM sys.database_principals AS p
   JOIN sys.database_permissions AS prm
      ON p.principal_id = prm.grantee_principal_id
      LEFT JOIN sys.database_principals AS p2
      ON prm.major_id = p2.principal_id
      LEFT JOIN sys.database_role_members r
      ON p.principal_id = r.member_principal_id
      LEFT JOIN sys.database_principals AS p3
      ON r.role_principal_id = p3.principal_id
   WHERE p.name = 'dbo';
   ```

10. Optionally, repeat the previous 3 steps for the `AdventureWorksLT` user database.

## Create a new user in the `AdventureWorksLT` database with `SELECT` permissions

In this section of the tutorial, you create a new user account in the `AdventureWorksLT` database, test this user's permissions as member of the public role, grant this user `SELECT` permissions, and then test this user's permissions again.

1. In Object Explorer, right-click **`AdventureWorksLT`** and then click **New Query** to open a query window connected to the `AdventureWorksLT` database.
2. Execute the following query to create a new user called `user1` in the `AdventureWorksLT` database.

   ```
   CREATE USER user1
   WITH PASSWORD = 'p@ssw0rd';
   ```
   ![new user user1 AdventureWorksLT](./media/sql-database-control-access-sql-authentication-get-started/new_user_user1_aw.png)

3. In the query window, execute the following query to return information about the permissions of `user1`. Notice that the only permissions that `user1` has are the permissions inherited from the `public` role.

   ```
   SELECT prm.permission_name
      , prm.class_desc
      , prm.state_desc
      , p2.name as 'Database role'
      , p3.name as 'Additional database role' 
   FROM sys.database_principals AS p
   JOIN sys.database_permissions AS prm
      ON p.principal_id = prm.grantee_principal_id
      LEFT JOIN sys.database_principals AS p2
      ON prm.major_id = p2.principal_id
      LEFT JOIN sys.database_role_members r
      ON p.principal_id = r.member_principal_id
      LEFT JOIN sys.database_principals AS p3
      ON r.role_principal_id = p3.principal_id
   WHERE p.name = 'user1';
   ```

   ![new user permissions in a user database](./media/sql-database-control-access-sql-authentication-get-started/new_user_permissions_in_user_database.png)

4. Execute the following queries to attempt to query a table in the `AdventureWorksLT` database as `user1`.

   ```
   EXECUTE AS USER = 'user1';  
   SELECT * FROM [SalesLT].[ProductCategory];
   REVERT;
   ```

   ![no select permissions](./media/sql-database-control-access-sql-authentication-get-started/no_select_permissions.png)

5. Execute the following query to grant `SELECT` permissions on the `ProductCategory` table in the `SalesLT` schema to `user1`.

   ```
   GRANT SELECT ON OBJECT::[SalesLT].[ProductCategory] to user1;
   ```

   ![grant select permissions](./media/sql-database-control-access-sql-authentication-get-started/grant_select_permissions.png)

6. Execute the following queries to attempt to query a table in the `AdventureWorksLT` database as `user1`.

   ```
   EXECUTE AS USER = 'user1';  
   SELECT * FROM [SalesLT].[ProductCategory];
   REVERT;
   ```

   ![select permissions](./media/sql-database-control-access-sql-authentication-get-started/select_permissions.png)

## Create a database-level firewall rule for `AdventureWorksLT` database users

In this section of the tutorial, you log in as the new AdventureWorksLT database user using the same computer for which you created a server-level firewall rule, attempt to log in from a computer with a different IP address, create a database-level firewall rule, and then log in using this new database-level firewall rule. 

1. On another computer for which you have not already created a server-level firewall rule, open SQL Server Management Studio.

   > [!IMPORTANT]
   > Always use the latest version of SSMS at [Download SQL Server Management Studio](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt238290.aspx). 
   >

2. In the Connect to Server window, enter the server name and authentication information to connect using SQL Server authentication with the 'user1' account. 
    
   ![Connect as user1 without firewall rule1](./media/sql-database-control-access-sql-authentication-get-started/connect-user1_no_rule1.png)

3. Click **Options** to specify the database to which you want to connect and then type **'AdventureWorksLT'** in the **Connect to Database** drop-down box on the **Connection Properties** tab.
   
   ![Connect as user1 without firewall rule2](./media/sql-database-control-access-sql-authentication-get-started/connect-user1_no_rule2.png)

4. Click **Connect**. A dialog box appears informing you that the computer from which you are attempting to connect to SQL Database does not have a firewall rule enabling access to the database. The dialog box that you receive has two variations depending upon steps you have previously taken with firewalls, but you will usually get the first dialog box shown below.

   ![Connect as user1 without firewall rule3](./media/sql-database-control-access-sql-authentication-get-started/connect-user1_no_rule3.png)

   ![Connect as user1 without firewall rule4](./media/sql-database-control-access-sql-authentication-get-started/connect-user1_no_rule4.png)

   > [!NOTE]
   > The newest versions of SSMS include the functionality to allow subscription owners and contributors to sign in to Microsoft Azure and create a server-level firewall rule.
   > 

4. Copy the client IP address from this dialog box for use in step 7.
5. Click **Cancel** but do not close the **Connect to Server** dialog box.
6. Switch back to a computer for which you have already created a server-level firewall rule and connect to your server using the Server admin account.
7. Open a new query window connected to the `master` database and execute the following query to create a database-level firewall by executing `[sp_set_firewall_rule](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn270017.aspx)` using the IP address from step 4:

   ```
   EXECUTE sp_set_firewall_rule @name = N'AdventureWorksLTFirewallRule',
     @start_ip_address = 'x.x.x.x', @end_ip_address = 'x.x.x.x'
   ```

   ![Connect as user1 without firewall rule4](./media/sql-database-control-access-sql-authentication-get-started/user1_add_rule_aw.png)

8. Switch computers again and click **Connect** in the **Connect to Server** dialog box to connect to `AdventureWorksLT` as `user1`. 

   ![Connect as user1 with firewall rule1](./media/sql-database-control-access-sql-authentication-get-started/connect-user1_rule1.png)

9. In Object Explorer, expand **Databases**, expand **AdventureWorksLT**, and then expand **Tables**. Notice that `user1` only has permission to view a single table, the `**SalesLT.ProductCategory**` table. 

   ![Connect as user1 and view objects1](./media/sql-database-control-access-sql-authentication-get-started/connect-user1_view_objects1.png)

   
      ![SQL Server Management Studio: Connect to SQL Database server](./media/sql-database-sql-server-management-studio-connect-user/connect-user-5.png)
