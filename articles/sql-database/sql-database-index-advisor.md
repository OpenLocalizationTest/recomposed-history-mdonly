# SQL Database Advisor

The Azure SQL Database Index Advisor has been updated to not only provide recommendations for creating and dropping indexes, but now includes recommendations to parameterize queries, and to fix schema issues. With these additional recommendations the Index Advisor is now the **SQL Database Advisor**. 

The SQL Database Advisor assesses performance by analyzing your SQL database's usage history. The recommendations that are best suited for running your databaseâ€™s typical workload are recommended.

The advisor assists you in tuning your database performance by:

- providing recommendations on which indexes to create (recommendations are available for non-clustered indexes only).
- providing recommendations on which indexes to drop (drop index recommendations are in preview and currently apply to duplicate indexes only).
- allowing you to opt-in to apply index recommendations automatically without any user interaction. (Automated recommendations require [Query Store](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn817826.aspx) is enabled and running.)
- providing recommendations on queries that will benefit from parameterization.
- providing recommendations on fixing schema issues. 
- automatically rolling back recommendations that have a negative impact on performance. 

This article describes SQL Database Advisor for V12 servers. Recommendations are available for V11 servers but you must run the provided Transact-SQL (T-SQL) script to implement the recommendation. The advisor will not revert operations on V11 servers so you should monitor and revert the performance impact as necessary.


### Permissions

To view and create recommendations, you need the correct [role-based access control](../active-directory/role-based-access-control-configure.md) permissions in Azure. 

- **Reader**, **SQL DB Contributor** permissions are required to view recommendations.
- **Owner**, **SQL DB Contributor** permissions are required to execute any actions; create or drop indexes and cancel index creation.


## Recommendations

### Create Index recommendations

**Create Index** recommendations appear when the SQL Database service detects a missing index that if created, can benefit your databases workload.


### Drop Index recommendations

**Drop Index** recommendations appear when the SQL Database service detects duplicate indexes.

### Parameterize queries recommendations

**Parameterize queries** recommendations appear when the SQL Database service detects that you have one or more queries that are constantly being recompiled but end up with the same query execution plan. This opens up an opportunity to apply forced parameterization, which will allow  query plans to be cached and reused in the future. 

### Fix schema issues recommendations

**Fix schema issues** recommendations appear when the SQL Database service notices an anomaly in the number of schema related SQL errors happening on your Azure SQL Database. This recommendation typically appears when your database encounters multiple schema-related errors (invalid column name, etc...) within an hour.


## Viewing recommendations

The recommendations page is where you view the top recommendations based on their potential impact to improve performance. You can also view the status of the last several operations. Select a recommendation or status to see it's details.

To view recommendations:

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
2. Click **BROWSE** > **SQL databases**, and select your database.
5. Click **All settings** > **Recommendations** to view available **Recommendations** for the selected database.

> [AZURE.NOTE] To get recommendations a database needs to have about a week of usage, and within that week there needs to be some activity. There also needs to be some consistent activity as well. The index advisor can more easily optimize for consistent query patterns than it can for random spotty bursts of activity. If recommendations are not available the **Recommendations** page should provide a message explaining why.

![Recommended Indexes](./media/sql-database-index-advisor/recommendations.png)

Recommendations are sorted by their potential impact on performance into the following 4 categories:

| Impact | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| High | High impact recommendations should provide the most significant performance impact. |
| Substantial | Substantial impact recommendations should improve performance noticeably. |
| Moderate | Moderate impact recommendations should improve performance, but not substantially. |
| Low | Low impact recommendations should provide better performance than without, but improvements might not be significant. 


### Removing recommendations from the list

If your list of recommendations contains items that you want to remove from the list you can discard the recommendation:

1. Select a recommendation in the list of **Recommendations**.
2. Click **Discard** on the **Details** blade.


If desired, you can add discarded items back to the **Recommendations** list:

1. On the **Recommendations** blade click **View discarded**.
1. Select a discarded item from the list to view its details.
1. Optionally, click **Undo Discard** to add the index back to the main list of **Recommendations**.



## Applying recommendations

SQL Database Advisor gives you full control over how recommendations are enabled using any of the 3 options below. 

- Apply individual recommendations one at a time.
- Enable the advisor to automatically apply recommendations (currently applies to index recommendations only).
- Manually run the recommended T-SQL script against your database to implement a recommendation.

Select any recommendation to view it's details and then click **View script** to review the exact details of how the recommendation will be created.

The database remains online while the advisor applies the recommendation -- using SQL Database Advisor will never take a database offline.

### Apply an individual recommendation

You can review and accept recommendations one at a time.

1. On the **Recommendations** blade click a recommendation.
2. On the **Details** blade click **Apply**.

    ![Apply recommendation](./media/sql-database-index-advisor/apply.png)


### Enable automatic index management

You can set the SQL Database Advisor to implement recommendations automatically. As recommendations become available they will automatically be applied. As with all index operations managed by the service if the performance impact is negative the recommendation will be reverted.

1. On the **Recommendations** blade click **Automate**:

    ![Advisor settings](./media/sql-database-index-advisor/settings.png)

2. Set the advisor to automatically **Create** or **Drop** indexes:

    ![Recommended Indexes](./media/sql-database-index-advisor/automation.png)




### Manually run the recommended T-SQL script

Select any recommendation and then click **View script**. Run this script against your database to manually apply the recommendation.

*Indexes that are manually executed are not monitored and validated for performance impact by the service* so it is suggested that you monitor these indexes after creation to verify they provide performance gains and adjust or delete them if necessary. For details about creating indexes, see [CREATE INDEX (Transact-SQL)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms188783.aspx).


### Canceling index creation

Indexes that are in a **Pending** status can be canceled. Indexes that are being created (**Executing** status) cannot be canceled.

1. Select any **Pending** index in the **Index operations** area to open the **Index details** blade.
2. Click **Cancel** to abort the index creation process.



## Monitoring operations

Applying a recommendation might not happen instantaneously. The portal provides details regarding the status of recommendation operations. The following are possible states that an index can be in:

| Status | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| Pending | Create index command has been received and the index is scheduled for creation. |
| Executing | The create index command is running and the index is currently being created. |
| Success | The index has successfully been created. |
| Failed | Index has not been created. This can be a transient issue, or possibly a schema change to the table and the script is no longer valid. |
| Reverting | The index creation process has been canceled or has been deemed non-performant and is being automatically reverted. |

Click an in-process recommendation from the list to see it's details:

### Reverting an index

If you used the advisor to create an index (meaning you did not manually run the T-SQL script) it will automatically revert the index if it finds the performance impact to be negative. If for any reason you simply want to revert an index advisor operation you can do the following.


1. Select a successfully created index in the list of **Index operations**.
2. Click **Revert** on the **Index details** blade, or click **View Script** for a DROP INDEX script that you can run.

## Monitoring performance impact of index recommendations

After recommendations are successfully implemented you can click **Query Insights** on the Index details blade to open [Query Performance Insights](sql-database-query-performance.md) and see the performance impact of your top queries.

## Summary

SQL Database Advisor provides recommendations for improving SQL database performance. By providing T-SQL scripts, as well as individual and fully-automatic (currently index only), the advisor provides helpful assistance in optimizing your databases and ultimately improving query performance.



## Next steps

Monitor your recommendations and continue to apply them to refine performance. Database workloads are dynamic and change continuously. SQL Database advisor will continue to monitor and provide recommendations that can potentially improve your database's performance.
