## When your app grows from a small number of customers to just about everyone, Azure SQL Database can scale on the fly without app downtime

One of the advantages of running SQL Database on Microsoft Azure is being able to scale performance up or down, and on the fly to quickly adapt to changing workload demands.  SQL Database offers a broad spectrum of performance levels to meet the specific needs of your application. And each level guarantees performance, so your app users have a predictable performance experience.

## When your app is an overnight success
SQL Database makes it easy to scale at a moment's notice. So if your app becomes an overnight success, it's just one click to accommodate the new performance needs. Plus, without any downtime, you won't have to worry about your app taking a hit when the time comes to scale up or down.

## Within your budget  

The last thing you should think about when you're trying to create an app is how much your database is going to cost you. That's why SQL Database has a pay-what-you-need plan. With Basic, Standard, and Premium performance options, you can decide which performance option will fit your budget. And, if your app takes off, you can scale up at anytime.

## Get the fastest performance

SQL Database includes cutting edge in-memory technology to execute extremely fast transactions and perform real-time analytical queries at the same time. Built-in advisors help developers migrate to in-memory tables, indexes, or store procedures.  As a result, end users can experience up to 30x faster transaction processing and 100x faster query processing.
