# Design your first Azure SQL database

In this tutorial, you are going to learn how to

* Create a table in the database
* Load data into the table 
* Add an index to the table to optimize query performance
* Drop the table 
* Restore the database to a point in time 
* Connect to and query the table 

This tutorial uses as its starting point the resources created in one of these quick starts: [Create DB - Portal](sql-database-get-started-portal.md), [Create DB - CLI](sql-database-get-started-cli.md), [CreateDB - PowerShell](sql-database-get-started-powershell.md)

Before you start:

* Make sure you can connect to, and query the SQL Database you created:
[Connect Using SSMS](sql-database-connect-query-ssms.md), [Connect using Visual Studio Code](sql-database-connect-query-vscode.md)
* Install the Bulk Copy (BCP) command-line utility:
[Install For Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=53591), [Install For Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/linux/sql-server-linux-setup-tools)

## Step 1 - Create a table 

### Connect to the database 
* [Connect using SQL Server Management Studio](sql-database-connect-query-ssms.md)
* [Connect using Visual Studio Code](sql-database-connect-query-vscode.md)

### Create a 'Students' table in the database 
In an SSMS query window or in the VS Code editor, enter the following query in the window, and execute it:

```sql 
CREATE TABLE [dbo].[Students]
(
  [student_id] int, 
  [name] varchar(30),
  [age] int,
  [email] varchar(40),
  [AddressID] int REFERENCES [SalesLT].[Address] (AddressID)
);
```

Once the query is complete, you have created a table in your database called Students.

## Step 2 - Load data into the table 
* [Download this sample txt file](https://microsoft-my.sharepoint.com/personal/ayolubek_microsoft_com/_layouts/15/guestaccess.aspx?guestaccesstoken=gQYCb16yjnJBDrK5aJaq8CMrlXNxf55ylI%2fi5XVCXQw%3d&docid=2_1b4c3b5ec415349fe9e35fdf4cb7ffb63&rev=1) into your local machine. In this example, we assume it is stored in the following location, *C:\Temp\SampleStudentData.txt*
* Open a command prompt window and run the following command, replacing the values for *ServerName*, *DatabaseName*, *UserName*, and *Password* with your own.

```bcp
bcp Students in C:\Temp\SampleStudentData.txt -S <ServerName> -d <DatabaseName> -U <Username> -P <password> -q -c -t ",""
```

You have now loaded sample data into the table you created earlier.

## Step 3 - Add an index to the table 
Indexes are structures in a database that speed up data retrieval. You create an index on the age column of the Students table to speed up retrieval of students matching an age range.

### Add an index to table 
In an SSMS query window or in the VS Code editor, enter the following query in the window, and execute it:

```sql 
CREATE CLUSTERED INDEX IX_Age ON Students (age);
```

### Query data from table with index 
In an SSMS query window or in the VS Code editor, enter the following query in the window, and execute it: 

```sql
SELECT name, age, email 
FROM [dbo].[Students]
WHERE age > 20
```

This query returns the name, age, and email of students who are older than 20 years old.

## Step 4 - Restore database to a point in time before table creation 
Databases in Azure have continuous backups that are taken automatically every 5 - 10 minutes. These backups allow you to restore your database to a previous point in time. Restoring a database to a different point in time creates a duplicate database in the same server as the original database. The following steps restore the sample database to a point before the *Students* table was added. 

### Log in to the Azure portal 
Log in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/)

### Restore database 
* Navigate to the sample database you created in the quickstart
* Click **Restore** on the database blade 
* Fill out the SQL Database form with the required information:
	* DatabaseName: Provide a database name 
	* Point-in-time: Select the **Point-in-time** tab on the restore blade 
	* Restore point: Input a time that occurs before the database was changed
	* Target server: You cannot change this value when restoring a database 
	* Elastic database pool: Select **None** for this tutorial 
	* Pricing tier: Select **20 DTUs** and **250 GB** of storage.

You have now restored the sample database to a point in time before the *Students* table was added.
