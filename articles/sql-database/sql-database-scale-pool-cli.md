# Scale an elastic pool in Azure SQL Database using the Azure CLI

The sample script provided here creates an elastic database pool in the North Central US region and scales the performance up. This sample works in Bash. For options on running Azure CLI scripts on Windows, see [Running the Azure CLI in Windows](../virtual-machines/virtual-machines-windows-cli-options.md).

Before running this script, ensure that a connection with Azure has been created using the `az login` command. Also, an SSH public key with the name `id_rsa.pub` must be stored in the ~/.ssh directory. Finally, the OMS workspace ID and workspace key need to be updated in the script.

## Scale an elastic pool

[!code-azurecli[main](../../cli_scripts/sql-database/scale-pool/scale-pool.sh "Move database between pools")]

## Clean up deployment

After the script sample has been run, the following command can be used to remove the Resource Group, logical server and SQL Database.

```azurecli
az group delete --name SampleResourceGroup
```

## Script explanation

This script uses the following commands to create a resource group, logical server, SQL Database, and firewall rules. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.

| Command | Notes |
|---|---|
| [az group create](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/group#create) | Creates a resource group in which all resources are stored. |
| [az sql server create](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/sql/server#create) | Creates a logical server that hosts the SQL Database. |
| [az sql elastic-pools create](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/sql/elastic-pools#create) | Creates an elastic database pool within the logical server. |
| [az sql db create](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/sql/db#create) | Creates the SQL Database in the logical server. |
| [az sql elastic-pools update](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/sql/elastic-pools#update) | Updates an elastic database pool, in this example changes the assigned eDTU. |
| [az group delete](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/vm/extension#set) | Deletes a resource group including all nested resources. |
