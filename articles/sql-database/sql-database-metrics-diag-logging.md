# Azure SQL Database metrics and diagnostics logging 
Azure SQL Database resources can emit metrics and diagnostic logs for easier monitoring. You can configure Azure SQL Database   resource to store resource usage, connectivity, and query execution statistics (Query Store ) into one of these Azure resources:
- **Azure Storage** – for archiving vast amounts of telemetry for a small price
- **Azure Event Hub** – for integrating Azure SQL Database telemetry with your custom monitoring solution or hot pipelines
- **Azure Log Analytics** – for out of the box monitoring solution with reporting, alerting, and mitigating capabilities

## Enable metrics and diagnostics logging

Metrics and diagnostics logging is not enabled by default. To enable Azure SQL Database metrics and diagnostic logging:
- Create a resource where Azure will store or send the data. 
- Specify then this resource when you enable diagnostic logging for your Azure SQL DB resource. 

To enable metrics and diagnostic logs collection, see [Enable collection of metrics and diagnostic logs for Azure SQL Database](sql-database-enable-metrics-diag-collection.md)

We recommend that you read the both [Overview of metrics in Microsoft Azure](../monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-overview-metrics.md) and [Overview of Azure Diagnostic Logs](../monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-overview-of-diagnostic-logs.md) articles to gain an understanding of not only how to enable logging, but the metrics and log categories supported by the various Azure services. For example, Azure SQL Database currently supports two log categories: Activity log and Query Store.

## 1-minute metrics

| |  |
|---|---|
|**Resource**|**Metrics**|
|Database|DTU percentage, DTU limit, CPU percentage, Physical data read percentage, Log write percentage, Successful/Failed/Blocked by firewall connections, sessions percentage, workers percentage, storage, storage percentage, XTP storage percentage|
|Elastic pool|eDTU percentage, eDTU limit, CPU percentage, Physical data read percentage, Log write percentage, Successful/Failed/Blocked by firewall connections, sessions percentage, workers percentage, storage, storage percentage, XTP storage percentage |

## Query Store logs

Azure SQL Database Query Store Logs contain execution statistics of the queries executed in Azure SQL Database. Query execution statistics are aggregated for each unique query shape (based on query hash) in one hour intervals and stored into the selected storage in JSON format.
