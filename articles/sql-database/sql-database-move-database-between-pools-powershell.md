# Create elastic pools and move databases between pools and out of a pool using PowerShell

This sample PowerShell script creates two elastic pools and moves a database from one elastic pool into another elastic pool, and then moves a database out of an elastic pool to a single database performance level. 

Before running this script, ensure that a connection with Azure has been created using the `Add-AzureRmAccount` cmdlet.

## Script Samples

[!code-powershell[main](../../powershell_scripts/sql-database/move-database-between-pools-and-standalone/move-database-between-pools-and-standalone.ps1 "Move database between pools")]

## Clean up deployment

After the script sample has been run, the following command can be used to remove the Resource Group and all resources associated with it.

```azurepowershell
Remove-AzureRmResourceGroup -ResourceGroupName "myResourceGroup"
```
