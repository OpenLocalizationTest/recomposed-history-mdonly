> To allow applications from Azure to connect to your database server, Azure connections must be enabled. For more information about firewall rules and enabling connections from Azure, see [Azure SQL Database Firewall](sql-database-firewall-configure.md). If you are making connections inside the Azure cloud boundary, you may have to open some additional TCP ports. For more information, see the "V12 of SQL Database: Outside vs inside" section of [Ports beyond 1433 for ADO.NET 4.5 and SQL Database V12](sql-database-develop-direct-route-ports-adonet-v12.md).
