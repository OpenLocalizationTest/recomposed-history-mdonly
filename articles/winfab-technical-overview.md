# Technical Overview 

Windows Fabric is a distributed systems platform that makes it easy to build scalable, reliable, low-latency, and easily managed services and applications for the cloud. Windows Fabric enables applications and services across all tiers to run reliably at cloud scale with the ability to be patched and managed without downtime.

## Capabilities
By using Windows Fabric, you can:

- Develop stateful, scalable, and highly available applications.

- Deploy applications at higher density than on virtual machines.

- Deploy different versions of the same application side-by-side.

- Manage the lifecycle of your stateful applications without downtime, including breaking and non-breaking upgrades.

- Upgrade and patch services within applications independently.

- Monitor and diagnose the health of my applications and set policies to perform automatic repairs.

- Scale-up or scale-down your cluster easily, knowing that the applications will scale according to the available resources.

- Develop a client that can communicate with the applications that are using existing client and server technologies.
