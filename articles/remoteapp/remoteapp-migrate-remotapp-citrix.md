# How to migrate from Azure RemoteApp to Citrix XenApp Essentials

As an Azure RemoteApp customer that desires to migrate to Citrix XenApp Essentials, there are a few prerequisites before you migrate. This article will help fill in the gaps while answering your top questions as you migrate off Azure RemoteApp onto Citrix XenApp Essentials. 

We recommend you to become familiar with Citrix's [step by step technical deployment guide for Citrix XenApp Essentials](https://docs.citrix.com/content/dam/docs/en-us/citrix-cloud/downloads/xenapp-essentials-deployment-guide.pdf) as first step, and also read their [online technical library](http://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-cloud/xenapp-and-xendesktop-service/xenapp-essentials.html). 

Now that you have read and are familiar with the XenApp Essentials deployment guide, we are glad to let you know that you can reuse majority of the investments you've already made in Azure RemoteApp but there a few steps before you begin. Below are a high level prerequisites before deploying XenApp Essentials.

## Prerequisites

1. Create a new or determine which Azure VNET in ARM that you'll deploy Citrix XenApp Essentials into. Azure RemoteApp uses Azure classic and Citrix XenApp Essentials uses only support ARM.  
2. Ensure that VNET you selected has networking access to your domain controller, Citrix only supports hybrid deployments. If you are using a Cloud deployment of Azure RemoteApp you will need to ensure your VNET has networking access to an Active Directory domain controller and or we recommend you use Azure Active Directly Domain Services (AAD-DS). 
3. Ensure DNS is properly configured for VNET so domain join will be successful on your first attempt. Recommend to test everything is working properly by creating a Virtual Machine in that VNET you selected and performing a manual domain join to ensure DNS and domain join works as expected. This will ensure your first time success deploying Citrix XenApp Essentials. 
4. If needed, create a VNET peering between a Azure classic VNET you are using with Azure RemoteApp and your ARM VNET if they reside in the same region and or use S2S VPN if they are not in order to connect VNET's for networking. 
5. If needed, read [How to migrate data into and out of Azure RemoteApp](remoteapp-migrate.md). 
6. Update your existing Azure RemoteApp image to include the Citrix VDA component, reference Citrix documentation on instructions. 
7. Go to Azure Marketplace and begin Citrix XenApp Essentials deployment.

Good luck, and thank you for using Azure RemoteApp. 

## Other considerations:

- Citrix XenApp Essentials only supports hybrid deployments. In other words, it requires network access to a domain controller in order to perform domain join. If you are using a Cloud deployment of Azure RemoteApp, you will need to either use AAD-DS or ensure your VNET has access to Active Directory for domain join. 
- TO learn how to movie user data to CXE, read [How to migrate data into and out of Azure RemoteApp](remoteapp-migrate.md). 
- Citrix XenApp Essentials only supports Active Directory accounts. It doesn not support Microsoft Accounts (@outlook.com, @msn.com, @hotmail.com, etc.).
