# Transfer data with AzCopy on Linux
## Overview
AzCopy on Linux is a command-line utility designed for copying data to and from Microsoft Azure Blob and File storage using simple commands with optimal performance. You can copy data from one object to another within your storage account, or between storage accounts.

There are two versions of AzCopy that you can download. [AzCopy on Windows] (https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/storage-use-azcopy) is built with .NET Framework, and offers Windows style command-line options. AzCopy on Linux is built with .NET Core Framework, which targets Linux platforms offering POSIX style command-line options. This article covers AzCopy on Linux.

## Download and install AzCopy
### AzCopy on Linux
#### Installation on Linux

AzCopy on Linux requires .NET Core framework on the platform. See the installation instructions on the [.NET Core] (https://www.microsoft.com/net/core#linuxredhat) page.

As an example, let's install .NET Core on Ubuntu 16.10:

```bash
sudo sh -c 'echo "deb [arch=amd64] https://apt-mo.trafficmanager.net/repos/dotnet-release/ yakkety main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/dotnetdev.list' 
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-keys 417A0893
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install dotnet-dev-1.0.3
```

Once you have installed .NET Core, download and install AzCopy.

##### Ubuntu

```bash
sudo apt-get install azcopy
```

##### Other Linux distributions

```bash
wget -O azcopy.tar.gz https://aka.ms/downloadazcopyprlinux
tar -xf azcopy.tar.gz
sudo ./install.sh
```

You can remove the extracted files once AzCopy on Linux is installed. Alternatively if you do not have superuser privileges, you can also run AzCopy using the shell script 'azcopy' in the extracted folder. 

## Writing your first AzCopy command
The basic syntax for AzCopy commands is:

```azcopy
azcopy --source <source> --destination <destination> [Options]
```

The following examples demonstrate various scenarios for copying data to and from Microsoft Azure Blobs and Files. Refer to the [AzCopy Parameters](#azcopy-parameters) section for a detailed explanation of the parameters used in each sample.

## Blob: Download
### Download single blob

```azcopy
azcopy --source https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer --destination /mnt/myfiles --source-key <key> --include "abc.txt"
```

Note that if the folder `/mnt/myfiles` does not exist, AzCopy creates it and downloads `abc.txt ` into the new folder.

### Download single blob from secondary region

```azcopy
azcopy --source https://myaccount-secondary.blob.core.windows.net/mynewcontainer --destination /mnt/myfiles --source-key <key> --include "abc.txt"
```

Note that you must have read-access geo-redundant storage enabled.

### Download all blobs

```azcopy
azcopy --source https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer --destination /mnt/myfiles --source-key <key> --recursive
```

Assume the following blobs reside in the specified container:  

    abc.txt
    abc1.txt
    abc2.txt
    vd1/a.txt
    vd1/abcd.txt

After the download operation, the directory `/mnt/myfiles` includes the following files:

    /mnt/myfiles/abc.txt
    /mnt/myfiles/abc1.txt
    /mnt/myfiles/abc2.txt
    /mnt/myfiles/vd1/a.txt
    /mnt/myfiles/vd1/abcd.txt

If you do not specify option `--recursive`, no blob will be downloaded.

### Download blobs with specified prefix

```azcopy
azcopy --source https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer --destination /mnt/myfiles --source-key <key> --include "a" --recursive
```

Assume the following blobs reside in the specified container. All blobs beginning with the prefix `a` are downloaded.

    abc.txt
    abc1.txt
    abc2.txt
    xyz.txt
    vd1\a.txt
    vd1\abcd.txt

After the download operation, the folder `/mnt/myfiles` includes the following files:

    /mnt/myfiles/abc.txt
    /mnt/myfiles/abc1.txt
    /mnt/myfiles/abc2.txt

The prefix applies to the virtual directory, which forms the first part of the blob name. In the example shown above, the virtual directory does not match the specified prefix, so no blob is downloaded. In addition, if the option `--recursive` is not specified, AzCopy does not download any blobs.

### Set the last-modified time of exported files to be same as the source blobs

```azcopy
azcopy --source https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer --destination "/mnt/myfiles" --source-key <key> --preserve-last-modified-time
```

You can also exclude blobs from the download operation based on their last-modified time. For example, if you want to exclude blobs whose last modified time is the same or newer than the destination file, add the `--exclude-newer` option:

```azcopy
azcopy --source https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer --destination /mnt/myfiles --source-key <key> --preserve-last-modified-time --exclude-newer
```

Or if you want to exclude blobs whose last modified time is the same or older than the destination file, add the `--exclude-older` option:

```azcopy
azcopy --source https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer --destination /mnt/myfiles --source-key <key> --preserve-last-modified-time --exclude-older
```

## Blob: Upload
### Upload single file

```azcopy
azcopy --source /mnt/myfiles --destination https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer --dest-key <key> --include "abc.txt"
```

If the specified destination container does not exist, AzCopy creates it and uploads the file into it.

### Upload single file to virtual directory

```azcopy
azcopy --source /mnt/myfiles --destination https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer --dest-key <key> --include "abc.txt"
```

If the specified virtual directory does not exist, AzCopy uploads the file to include the virtual directory in the blob name (*e.g.*, `vd/abc.txt` in the example above).

### Upload all files

```azcopy
azcopy --source /mnt/myfiles --destination https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer --dest-key <key> --recursive
```

Specifying option `--recursive` uploads the contents of the specified directory to Blob storage recursively, meaning that all subfolders and their files are uploaded as well. For instance, assume the following files reside in folder `/mnt/myfiles`:

    /mnt/myfiles/abc.txt
    /mnt/myfiles/abc1.txt
    /mnt/myfiles/abc2.txt
    /mnt/myfiles/subfolder/a.txt
    /mnt/myfiles/subfolder/abcd.txt

After the upload operation, the container includes the following files:

    abc.txt
    abc1.txt
    abc2.txt
    subfolder/a.txt
    subfolder/abcd.txt

When the option `--recursive` is not specified, only the following three files are uploaded:

    abc.txt
    abc1.txt
    abc2.txt

### Upload files matching specified pattern

```azcopy
azcopy --source /mnt/myfiles --destination https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer --dest-key <key> --include "a*" --recursive
```

Assume the following files reside in folder `/mnt/myfiles`:

    /mnt/myfiles/abc.txt
    /mnt/myfiles/abc1.txt
    /mnt/myfiles/abc2.txt
    /mnt/myfiles/xyz.txt
    /mnt/myfiles/subfolder/a.txt
    /mnt/myfiles/subfolder/abcd.txt

After the upload operation, the container includes the following files:

    abc.txt
    abc1.txt
    abc2.txt
    subfolder/a.txt
    subfolder/abcd.txt

When the option `--recursive` is not specified, AzCopy uploads only the blobs that don't reside in a virtual directory:

    /mnt/myfiles/abc.txt
    /mnt/myfiles/abc1.txt
    /mnt/myfiles/abc2.txt

### Specify the MIME content type of a destination blob
By default, AzCopy sets the content type of a destination blob to `application/octet-stream`. However, you can explicitly specify the content type via the option `--set-content-type [content-type]`. This syntax sets the content type for all blobs in an upload operation.

```azcopy
azcopy --source /mnt/myfiles --destination https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/myContainer/ --dest-key <key> --include "ab" --set-content-type "video/mp4"
```

If the option `--set-content-type` is specified without a value, then AzCopy sets each blob or file's content type according to its file extension.

```azcopy
azcopy --source /mnt/myfiles --destination https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/myContainer/ --dest-key <key> --include "ab" --set-content-type
```

## Blob: Copy
### Copy single blob within Storage account

```azcopy
azcopy --source https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer1 --destination https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer2 --source-key <key> --dest-key <key> --include "abc.txt"
```

When you copy a blob within a Storage account, a [server-side copy](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazurestorage/archive/2012/06/12/introducing-asynchronous-cross-account-copy-blob.aspx) operation is performed.

### Copy single blob across Storage accounts

```azcopy
azcopy --source https://sourceaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer1 --destination https://destaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer2 --source-key <key1> --dest-key <key2> --include "abc.txt"
```

When you copy a blob across Storage accounts, a [server-side copy](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazurestorage/archive/2012/06/12/introducing-asynchronous-cross-account-copy-blob.aspx) operation is performed.

### Copy single blob from secondary region to primary region

```azcopy
azcopy --source https://myaccount1-secondary.blob.core.windows.net/mynewcontainer1 --destination https://myaccount2.blob.core.windows.net/mynewcontainer2 --source-key <key1> --dest-key <key2> --include "abc.txt"
```

Note that you must have read-access geo-redundant storage enabled.

### Copy single blob and its snapshots across Storage accounts

```azcopy
azcopy --source https://sourceaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer1 --destination https://destaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer2 --source-key <key1> --dest-key <key2> --include "abc.txt" --include-snapshot
```

After the copy operation, the target container includes the blob and its snapshots. The container includes the following blob and its snapshots:

    abc.txt
    abc (2013-02-25 080757).txt
    abc (2014-02-21 150331).txt

### Synchronously copy blobs across Storage accounts
AzCopy by default copies data between two storage endpoints asynchronously. Therefore, the copy operation runs in the background using spare bandwidth capacity that has no SLA in terms of how fast a blob is copied. 

The `--sync-copy` option ensures that the copy operation gets consistent speed. AzCopy performs the synchronous copy by downloading the blobs to copy from the specified source to local memory, and then uploading them to the Blob storage destination.

```azcopy
azcopy --source https://myaccount1.blob.core.windows.net/myContainer/ --destination https://myaccount2.blob.core.windows.net/myContainer/ --source-key <key1> --dest-key <key2> --include "ab" --sync-copy
```

`--sync-copy` might generate additional egress cost compared to asynchronous copy. The recommended approach is to use this option in an Azure VM, that is in the same region as your source storage account to avoid egress cost.

## File: Download
### Download single file

```azcopy
azcopy --source https://myaccount.file.core.windows.net/myfileshare/myfolder1/ --destination /mnt/myfiles --source-key <key> --include "abc.txt"
```

If the specified source is an Azure file share, then you must either specify the exact file name, (*e.g.* `abc.txt`) to download a single file, or specify option `--recursive` to download all files in the share recursively. Attempting to specify both a file pattern and option `--recursive` together results in an error.

### Download all files

```azcopy
azcopy --source https://myaccount.file.core.windows.net/myfileshare/ --destination /mnt/myfiles --source-key <key> --recursive
```

Note that any empty folders are not downloaded.

## File: Upload
### Upload single file

```azcopy
azcopy --source /mnt/myfiles --destination https://myaccount.file.core.windows.net/myfileshare/ --dest-key <key> --include abc.txt
```

### Upload all files

```azcopy
azcopy --source /mnt/myfiles --destination https://myaccount.file.core.windows.net/myfileshare/ --dest-key <key> --recursive
```

Note that any empty folders are not uploaded.

### Upload files matching specified pattern

```azcopy
azcopy --source /mnt/myfiles --destination https://myaccount.file.core.windows.net/myfileshare/ --dest-key <key> --include ab* --recursive
```

## File: Copy
### Copy across file shares

```azcopy
azcopy --source https://myaccount1.file.core.windows.net/myfileshare1/ --destination https://myaccount2.file.core.windows.net/myfileshare2/ --source-key <key1> --dest-key <key2> --recursive
```
When you copy a file across file shares, a [server-side copy](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazurestorage/archive/2012/06/12/introducing-asynchronous-cross-account-copy-blob.aspx) operation is performed.

### Copy from file share to blob

```azcopy
azcopy --source https://myaccount1.file.core.windows.net/myfileshare/ --destination https://myaccount2.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/ --source-key <key1> --dest-key <key2> --recursive
```
When you copy a file from file share to blob, a [server-side copy](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazurestorage/archive/2012/06/12/introducing-asynchronous-cross-account-copy-blob.aspx) operation is performed.


### Copy from blob to file share

```azcopy
azcopy --source https://myaccount1.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/ --destination https://myaccount2.file.core.windows.net/myfileshare/ --source-key <key1> --dest-key <key2> --recursive
```
When you copy a file from blob to file share, a [server-side copy](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/windowsazurestorage/archive/2012/06/12/introducing-asynchronous-cross-account-copy-blob.aspx) operation is performed.

### Synchronously copy files
You can specify the `--sync-copy` option to copy data from File Storage to File Storage, from File Storage to Blob Storage and from Blob Storage to File Storage synchronously. AzCopy runs this operation by downloading the source data to local memory, and then uploading it to destination. In this case, standard egress cost applies.

```azcopy
azcopy --source https://myaccount1.file.core.windows.net/myfileshare1/ --destination https://myaccount2.file.core.windows.net/myfileshare2/ --source-key <key1> --dest-key <key2> --recursive --sync-copy
```

When copying from File Storage to Blob Storage, the default blob type is block blob, user can specify option `/BlobType:page` to change the destination blob type.

Note that `--sync-copy` might generate additional egress cost comparing to asynchronous copy. The recommended approach is to use this option in an Azure VM, that is in the same region as your source storage account to avoid egress cost.

## Other AzCopy features
### Only copy data that doesn't exist in the destination
The `--exclude-older` and `--exclude-newer` parameters allow you to exclude older or newer source resources from being copied, respectively. If you only want to copy source resources that don't exist in the destination, you can specify both parameters in the AzCopy command:

    --source http://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer --destination /mnt/myfiles --source-key <sourcekey> --recursive --exclude-older --exclude-newer

    --source /mnt/myfiles --destination http://myaccount.file.core.windows.net/myfileshare --dest-key <destkey> --recursive --exclude-older --exclude-newer

    --source http://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer --destination http://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer1 --source-key <sourcekey> --dest-key <destkey> --recursive --exclude-older --exclude-newer

### Use a configuration file to specify command-line parameters

```azcopy
azcopy --config-file "azcopy-config.ini"
```

You can include any AzCopy command-line parameters in a configuration file. AzCopy processes the parameters in the file as if they had been specified on the command line, performing a direct substitution with the contents of the file.

Assume a configuration file named `copyoperation`, that contains the following lines. Each AzCopy parameter can be specified on a single line.

    --source http://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer --destination /mnt/myfiles --source-key <sourcekey> --recursive --quiet

or on separate lines:

    --source http://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer
    --destination /mnt/myfiles
    --source-key<sourcekey>
    --recursive
    --quiet

AzCopy fails if you split the parameter across two lines, as shown here for the `--source-key` parameter:

    http://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer
    /mnt/myfiles
    --sourcekey
    <sourcekey>
    --recursive
    --quiet

### Specify a shared access signature (SAS)

```azcopy
azcopy --source https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer1 --destination https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer2 --source-sas <SAS1> --dest-sas <SAS2> --include abc.txt
```

You can also specify a SAS on the container URI:

```azcopy
azcopy --source https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer1/?SourceSASToken --destination /mnt/myfiles --recursive
```

### Journal file folder
Each time you issue a command to AzCopy, it checks whether a journal file exists in the default folder, or whether it exists in a folder that you specified via this option. If the journal file does not exist in either place, AzCopy treats the operation as new and generates a new journal file.

If the journal file does exist, AzCopy checks whether the command line that you input matches the command line in the journal file. If the two command lines match, AzCopy resumes the incomplete operation. If they do not match, AzCopy prompts user to either overwrite the journal file to start a new operation, or to cancel the current operation.

If you want to use the default location for the journal file:

```azcopy
azcopy --source /mnt/myfiles --destination https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer --dest-key <key> --resume
```

If you omit option `--resume`, or specify option `--resume` without the folder path, as shown above, AzCopy creates the journal file in the default location, which is `~\Microsoft\Azure\AzCopy`. If the journal file already exists, then AzCopy resumes the operation based on the journal file.

If you want to specify a custom location for the journal file:

```azcopy
azcopy --source /mnt/myfiles --destination https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer --dest-key key --resume "~"
```

This example creates the journal file if it does not already exist. If it does exist, then AzCopy resumes the operation based on the journal file.

If you want to resume an AzCopy operation:

```azcopy
azcopy --resume "~"
```

This example resumes the last operation, which may have failed to complete.

### Output verbose logs

```azcopy
azcopy --source /mnt/myfiles --destination https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer --dest-key <key> --verbose
```

### Specify the number of concurrent operations to start
Option `--parallel-level` specifies the number of concurrent copy operations. By default, AzCopy starts a certain number of concurrent operations to increase the data transfer throughput. For Table operations, the number of concurrent operations is equal to the number of processors you have. For Blob and File operations, the number of concurrent operations is equal eight times the number of processors you have. If you are running AzCopy across a low-bandwidth network, you can specify a lower number for --parallel-level to avoid failure caused by resource competition.

## AzCopy Parameters
Parameters for AzCopy are described below. You can also type one of the following commands from the command line for help in using AzCopy:

* For detailed command-line help for AzCopy: `AzCopy --help`

### --source "source"
Specifies the source data from which to copy. The source can be a file system directory, a blob container, a blob virtual directory, a storage file share, a storage file directory, or an Azure table.

### --destination "destination"
Specifies the destination to copy to. The destination can be a file system directory, a blob container, a blob virtual directory, a storage file share, a storage file directory, or an Azure table.

### --include "file-pattern"
Specifies a file pattern that indicates which files to copy. The behavior of the /Pattern parameter is determined by the location of the source data, and the presence of the recursive mode option. Recursive mode is specified via option --recursive.

If the specified source is a directory in the file system, then standard wildcards are in effect, and the file pattern provided is matched against files within the directory. If option --recursive is specified, then AzCopy also matches the specified pattern against all files in any subfolders beneath the directory.

If the specified source is a blob container or virtual directory, then wildcards are not applied. If option --recursive is specified, then AzCopy interprets the specified file pattern as a blob prefix. If option --recursive is not specified, then AzCopy matches the file pattern against exact blob names.

If the specified source is an Azure file share, then you must either specify the exact file name, (e.g. abc.txt) to copy a single file, or specify option --recursive to copy all files in the share recursively. Attempting to specify both a file pattern and option --recursive together results in an error.

AzCopy uses case-sensitive matching when the --source is a blob container or blob virtual directory, and uses case-insensitive matching in all the other cases.

The default file pattern used when no file pattern is specified is *.* for a file system location or an empty prefix for an Azure Storage location. Specifying multiple file patterns is not supported.

### --dest-key "storage-key"
Specifies the storage account key for the destination resource.

### --dest-sas "sas-token"
Specifies a Shared Access Signature (SAS) with READ and WRITE permissions for the destination (if applicable). Surround the SAS with double quotes, as it may contain special command-line characters.

If the destination resource is a blob container, file share or table, you can either specify this option followed by the SAS token, or you can specify the SAS as part of the destination blob container, file share or table's URI, without this option.

If the source and destination are both blobs, then the destination blob must reside within the same storage account as the source blob.

### --source-key "storage-key"
Specifies the storage account key for the source resource.

### --source-sas "sas-token"
Specifies a Shared Access Signature with READ and LIST permissions for the source (if applicable). Surround the SAS with double quotes, as it may contain special command-line characters.

If the source resource is a blob container, and neither a key nor a SAS is provided, then the blob container is read via anonymous access.

If the source is a file share or table, a key or a SAS must be provided.

### --recursive
Specifies recursive mode for copy operations. In recursive mode, AzCopy copies all blobs or files that match the specified file pattern, including those in subfolders.

### --blob-type "block" | "page" | "append"
Specifies whether the destination blob is a block blob, a page blob, or an append blob. This option is applicable only when you are uploading a blob. Otherwise, an error is generated. If the destination is a blob and this option is not specified, by default, AzCopy creates a block blob.

### --check-md5
Calculates an MD5 hash for downloaded data and verifies that the MD5 hash stored in the blob or file's Content-MD5 property matches the calculated hash. The MD5 check is turned off by default, so you must specify this option to perform the MD5 check when downloading data.

Note that Azure Storage doesn't guarantee that the MD5 hash stored for the blob or file is up-to-date. It is client's responsibility to update the MD5 whenever the blob or file is modified.

AzCopy always sets the Content-MD5 property for an Azure blob or file after uploading it to the service.  

### --include-snapshot
Indicates whether to transfer snapshots. This option is only valid when the source is a blob.

The transferred blob snapshots are renamed in this format: blob-name (snapshot-time).extension

By default, snapshots are not copied.

### --verbose
Outputs verbose status messages.

### --resume [journal-file-folder]
Specifies a journal file folder for resuming an operation.

AzCopy always supports resuming if an operation has been interrupted.

If this option is not specified, or it is specified without a folder path, then AzCopy creates the journal file in the default location, which is ~/Microsoft/Azure/AzCopy.

Each time you issue a command to AzCopy, it checks whether a journal file exists in the default folder, or whether it exists in a folder that you specified via this option. If the journal file does not exist in either place, AzCopy treats the operation as new and generates a new journal file.

If the journal file does exist, AzCopy checks whether the command line that you input matches the command line in the journal file. If the two command lines match, AzCopy resumes the incomplete operation. If they do not match, AzCopy prompts user to either overwrite the journal file to start a new operation, or to cancel the current operation.

The journal file is deleted upon successful completion of the operation.

Note that resuming an operation from a journal file created by a previous version of AzCopy is not supported.

### --config-file "parameter-file"
Specifies a file that contains parameters. AzCopy processes the parameters in the file just as if they had been specified on the command line.

In a configuration file, you can either specify multiple parameters on a single line, or specify each parameter on its own line. Note that an individual parameter cannot span multiple lines.

Configuration files can include comment lines that begin with the # symbol.

You can specify multiple configuration files. However, note that AzCopy does not support nested configuration files.

### --quiet
Suppresses all AzCopy confirmation prompts.

### --dry-run
Specifies a listing operation only. No data is copied.

AzCopy interprets the using of this option as a simulation for running the command line without this option --dry-run and count how many objects are copied, you can specify option --verbose at the same time to check which objects are copied in the verbose log.

The behavior of this option is also determined by the location of the source data and the presence of the recursive mode option --recursive and file pattern option --include.

AzCopy requires LIST and READ permission of this source location when using this option.

### --preserve-last-modified-time
Sets the downloaded file's last-modified time to be the same as the source blob or file's.

### --exclude-newer
Excludes a newer source resource. The resource is not copied if the last modified time of the source is the same or newer than destination.

### --exclude-older
Excludes an older source resource. The resource is not copied if the last modified time of the source is the same or older than destination.

### --delimiter "delimiter"
Indicates the delimiter character used to delimit virtual directories in a blob name.

By default, AzCopy uses / as the delimiter character. However, AzCopy supports using any common character (such as @, #, or %) as a delimiter. If you need to include one of these special characters on the command line, enclose the file name with double quotes.

This option is only applicable for downloading blobs.

### --parallel-level "number-of-concurrent-operations"
Specifies the number of concurrent operations.

AzCopy by default starts a certain number of concurrent operations to increase the data transfer throughput. Note that large number of concurrent operations in a low-bandwidth environment may overwhelm the network connection and prevent the operations from fully completing. Throttle concurrent operations based on actual available network bandwidth.

The upper limit for concurrent operations is 512. By default, this value is set to eight times the number of cores you have on your client.

### --sync-copy
Indicates whether to synchronously copy blobs or files between two Azure Storage endpoints.

AzCopy by default uses server-side asynchronous copy. Specify this option to perform a synchronous copy, which downloads blobs or files to local memory and then uploads them to Azure Storage.

You can use this option when copying files within Blob storage, within File storage, or from Blob storage to File storage or vice versa.

### --set-content-type "content-type"
Specifies the MIME content type for destination blobs or files.

AzCopy sets the content type for a blob or file to application/octet-stream by default. You can set the content type for all blobs or files by explicitly specifying a value for this option.

If you specify this option without a value, then AzCopy sets each blob or file's content type according to its file extension.

## Known Issues and Best Practices
### Error: .NET Core is not found in the system.
If you encounter an error stating that .NET Core is not installed in the system, the PATH to the .NET Core binary `dotnet` may be missing.

In order to address this issue, find the .NET Core binary in the system:
```bash
sudo find / -name dotnet
```

This returns the path to the dotnet binary. 

	/opt/rh/rh-dotnetcore11/root/usr/bin/dotnet
	/opt/rh/rh-dotnetcore11/root/usr/lib64/dotnetcore/dotnet
	/opt/rh/rh-dotnetcore11/root/usr/lib64/dotnetcore/shared/Microsoft.NETCore.App/1.1.2/dotnet

Now add this path to the PATH variable. For sudo, edit secure_path to contain the path to the dotnet binary:
```bash 
sudo visudo
### Append the path found in the preceding example to 'secure_path' variable
```

In this example, secure_path variable reads as:

```
secure_path = /sbin:/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/opt/rh/rh-dotnetcore11/root/usr/bin/
```

For the current user, edit .bash_profile/.profile to include the path to the dotnet binary in PATH variable 
```bash
vi ~/.bash_profile
### Append the path found in the preceding example to 'PATH' variable
```

Verify that .NET Core is now in PATH:
```bash
which dotnet
sudo which dotnet
```

### Error Installing AzCopy
If you encounter issues with AzCopy installation, you may try to run AzCopy using the bash script in the extracted `azcopy` folder.

```bash
cd azcopy
./azcopy
```

### Limit concurrent writes while copying data
When you copy blobs or files with AzCopy, keep in mind that another application may be modifying the data while you are copying it. If possible, ensure that the data you are copying is not being modified during the copy operation. For example, when copying a VHD associated with an Azure virtual machine, make sure that no other applications are currently writing to the VHD. A good way to do this is by leasing the resource to be copied. Alternately, you can create a snapshot of the VHD first and then copy the snapshot.

If you cannot prevent other applications from writing to blobs or files while they are being copied, then keep in mind that by the time the job finishes, the copied resources may no longer have full parity with the source resources.

### Run one AzCopy instance on one machine.
AzCopy is designed to maximize the utilization of your machine resource to accelerate the data transfer, we recommend you run only one AzCopy instance on one machine, and specify the option `/NC` if you need more concurrent operations. For more details, type `AzCopy /?:NC` at the command line.
