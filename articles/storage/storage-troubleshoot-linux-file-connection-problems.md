# Troubleshooting Azure File storage problems in Linux

[!INCLUDE [storage-troubleshoot-linux-file-connection-problems](../../includes/storage-troubleshoot-file-connection-problems-selector.md)]

This article lists common problems that are related to Microsoft Azure File storage when you connect from Linux clients. It also provides possible causes of and resolutions for these problems.

<a id="permissiondenied"></a>
## "[Permission denied] Disk quota exceeded" when you try to open a file

In Linux, you receive an error messages that resemble the following:

**<filename> [permission denied] Disk quota exceeded**

### Cause

The problem occurs because you have reached the upper limit of concurrent open handles that are allowed for a file.

### Solution

Reduce the number of concurrent open handles by closing some handles, and then retry the operation. For more information, see [Microsoft Azure Storage Performance and Scalability Checklist](storage-performance-checklist.md).

## Slow file copying to and from Azure file storage on Linux

1.	If you don’t have a specific minimum I/O size requirement, we recommend that you use 1 MB as the I/O size for optimal performance.
2.	If you know the final size of a file that you are extending by using writes, and your software doesn’t experience compatibility issues when unwritten tail on the file containing zeros, then set the file size in advance instead of having every write being an extending write.
3.	Use the right copy method:

  -	Use [AZCopy](storage-use-azcopy.md#file-copy) for any transfer between two file shares.
  -	Use [Robocopy](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/granth/2009/12/07/multi-threaded-robocopy-for-faster-copies/) between a file share an on-premises computer.

## "Mount error(112): Host is down" because of a reconnection time-out

This error occurs on the Linux client when the client has been idle for an extended time. When the client is idle for long time, the client disconnects, and the connection times out.  

### Cause

The connection can be idle for the followingreasons:

-	Network communication failures that prevent re-establishing a TCP connection to the server when the default “soft” mount option is used.
-	Recent reconnection fixes that are not present in older kernels.

### Solution

This reconnection problem in the Linux kernel is now fixed as part of the following sets of change:

- [Fix reconnect to not defer smb3 session reconnect long after socket reconnect](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/fs/cifs?id=4fcd1813e6404dd4420c7d12fb483f9320f0bf93)
-	[Call echo service immediately after socket reconnect](https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=b8c600120fc87d53642476f48c8055b38d6e14c7)
-	[CIFS: Fix a possible memory corruption during reconnect](https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=53e0e11efe9289535b060a51d4cf37c25e0d0f2b)
-	[CIFS: Fix a possible double locking of mutex during reconnect - for kernels v4.9 and higher](https://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/commit/?id=96a988ffeb90dba33a71c3826086fe67c897a183)

However, this change may not be ported yet to all the Linux distributions. This fix and other reconnection fixes are made in the following popular Linux kernels: 4.4.40 4.8.16, and 4.9.1. You can get this fix by upgrading to one of these recommended kernel versions.

### Workaround

-	You can work around this issue by specifying a hard mount. This forces the client to wait until a connection is established or until it’s explicitly interrupted and can be used to prevent errors because of network time-outs. However, you should be aware that this could cause indefinite waits, and you should be prepared to stop connections as necessary.

-  If you cannot upgrade to latest kernel versions, you can work around this issue by keeping a file in the Azure File share that you write to every 30 seconds or less. This must be a write operation, such as rewriting the created or modified date on the file. Otherwise, you might get cached results, and your operation might not trigger the reconnection.

<a id="error115"></a>
## "Mount error(115): Operation now in progress" when you mount Azure Files by using SMB 3.0

### Cause

Linux distributions do not yet support encryption feature in SMB 3.0. In some distributions, users may receive a "115" error message if they try to mount Azure Files by using SMB 3.0 because of a missing feature.

### Solution

If the Linux SMB client that is used does not support encryption, mount Azure Files by using SMB 2.1 from an Azure Linux VM that is in the same data center as the File storage account.

<a id="slowperformance"></a>
## Slow performance on Azure file share mounted on Linux VM

### Cause

One possible cause of slow performance is disabled caching. To check whether caching is disabled, look for the "cache=" entry. 

**Cache=none** indicates that caching is disabled.  Remount the share with default mount command or explicitly adding **cache=strict** option to mount command to ensure default caching or "strict" caching mode is enabled.

In some scenarios, the **serverino** mount option can cause the **ls** command to run stat against every directory entry and this behavior results in performance degradation when listing a big directory. You can check the mount options in your "/etc/fstab" entry:

`//azureuser.file.core.windows.net/cifs /cifs cifs vers=3.0,serverino,username=xxx,password=xxx,dir_mode=0777,file_mode=0777`

You can also check whether the correct options are being used by just running the  **sudo mount | grep cifs** command and checking as its output, such as the following exmaple output:

`//mabiccacifs.file.core.windows.net/cifs on /cifs type cifs (rw,relatime,vers=3.0,sec=ntlmssp,cache=strict,username=xxx,domain=X,uid=0,noforceuid,gid=0,noforcegid,addr=192.168.10.1,file_mode=0777, dir_mode=0777,persistenthandles,nounix,serverino,mapposix,rsize=1048576,wsize=1048576,actimeo=1)`

If the **cache=strict** or **serverino** options are not present, unmount and mount Azure Files again by running the mount command from the [documentation](storage-how-to-use-files-linux.md#mount-the-file-share) and re-check that **/etc/fstab** entry has the correct options.

<a id="error11"></a>
## "Mount error(11): Resource temporarily unavailable" when mounting to Ubuntu 4.8 kernel

### Cause

This is a known issue in Ubuntu 16.10 kernel (version 4.8) in which the client is documented to support encryption but actually doesn’t.

### Solution

Until Ubuntu 16.10 is fixed, specify the `vers=2.1` mount option or use Ubuntu 16.04.

<a id="timestampslost"></a>
## Timestamps were lost when copying files from Windows to Linux

On Linux/Unix platforms, the 'cp -p' command will fail if file1 and file 2 are owned by different users. The force flag 'f' in COPYFILE results in executing 'cp -p -f' on Unix, which also fails to preserve the timestamp of the file you do not own.

### Cause

This is a known issue.

### Workaround

Use the storage account user for copying the files:

- Useadd : [stprage account name]
- Passwd [storage account name]
- Su [storage account name]
- Cp -p filename.txt /share
