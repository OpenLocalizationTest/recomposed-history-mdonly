# Enumerating Jobs
To enumerate all jobs in a subscription, call the [List Jobs](/rest/api/storageservices/importexport/List-Jobs3) operation. `List Jobs` returns a list of jobs as well as the following attributes:  
  
-   The type of job (Import or Export)  
  
-   The current job state  
  
-   The jobâ€™s associated storage account  
  
-   The time the job was created
