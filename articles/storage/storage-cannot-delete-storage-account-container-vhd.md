# Troubleshoot deleting Azure storage accounts, containers or VHDs

## Summary
You may receive errors when you try to delete the Azure storage account, container or VHD in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) or the [Azure classic portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com/). The issues can be caused by:

-	When you delete a VM, the disk and VHD are not automatically deleted that may be the reason for failure on storage account deletion. We don’t delete the disk so that you can use the disk to mount another VM.

-	There is still a lease on a disk or the blob associated on the disk.

## Resolution
To resolve the most common issues, try the following method:

1. Switch to the [Azure classic portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com/).
2. Select **VIRTUAL MACHINE**>**DISKS**.

3. Locate the disks associated with the storage account, container or VHD that you want to delete. Check the location of the disk, you will find the associated storage account, container and VHD.

	![location](./media/storage-cannot-delete-storage-account-container-vhd/DiskLocation.png)

4. Confirm there is no VM listed on the **Attached to** field of the disks, and then delete the disks.

 	> [AZURE.NOTE] If a disk is attaching to a VM, you will not be able to delete it. Disks are detached from a deleted VM asynchronously, it may take a few minutes after the VM is deleted for this field to clear up.

5. Select **VIRTUAL MACHINE**>**IMAGES**, and then delete the images that are associated with the storage account, container or VHD.

After that, try to delete the storage account, container or VHD again.

> [AZURE.WARNING] Be sure to back up anything you want to save before you delete the account. It is not possible to restore a deleted storage account or retrieve any of the content that it contained before deletion. This also holds true for any resources in the account—once you delete a VHD, blob, table, queue, or file, it is permanently deleted. Please ensure the resource is not in use.

## Symptom

The following section lists common errors you may receive when trying to delete the Azure storage accounts, containers or VHDs, see:

### Scenario 1 Unable to delete a storage account

When you try to delete a storage account that you are no longer using by navigating to the storage account in the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) or [Azure classic portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com/), and select Delete, you may see the following error message:

**On the Azure portal**:

*Failed to delete storage account <vm-storage-account-name>. Unable to delete storage account <vm-storage-account-name>: 'Storage account <vm-storage-account-name> has some active image(s) and/or disk(s). Ensure these image(s) and/or disk(s) are removed before deleting this storage account.'.*

**On the Azure classic portal**:

*Storage account <vm-storage-account-name> has some active image(s) and/or disk(s), e.g. xxxxxxxxx- xxxxxxxxx-O-209490240936090599. Ensure these image(s) and/or disk(s) are removed before deleting this storage account.*

You may also see this error:

**On the Azure portal**:

*Storage account <vm-storage-account-name> has 1 container(s) which have an active image and/or disk artifacts. Ensure those artifacts are removed from the image repository before deleting this storage account*.

**On the Azure classic portal**:

*Submit Failed
Storage account <vm-storage-account-name> has 1 container(s) which have an active image and/or disk artifacts. Ensure those artifacts are removed from the image repository before deleting this storage account.
When you attempt to delete a storage account and there are still active disks associated with it, you will see a message telling you there are active disks that need to be deleted*.

### Scenario 2 Unable to delete a container

When you try to delete the storage container, you may see the following error:

*Failed to delete storage container <container name>. Error: 'There is currently a lease on the container and no lease ID was specified in the request*.

### Scenario 3 Unable to delete a VHD

After deleting a VM you try to delete the blobs for the associated VHDs and receive the message below:

*Failed to delete blob 'path/XXXXXX-XXXXXX-os-1447379084699.vhd'. Error: 'There is currently a lease on the blob and no lease ID was specified in the request.*

## More information

V1 VMs which have been retained will show as in the stopped deallocated state on either [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/) or [Azure classic portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com/).

**Azure classic portal**:

**Azure portal**:

![screenshot2](./media/storage-cannot-delete-storage-account-container-vhd/moreinfo2.png)

A status of “Stopped (deallocated)” releases the compute resources like the CPU, Memory and Network but the disks are still retained for the user to be able to quickly recreate the VM if required. These disks are created on top of VHDs which are backed by Azure storage. The storage account has these VHDs and the disks have leases on those VHDs.
