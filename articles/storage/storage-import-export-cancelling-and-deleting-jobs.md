# Cancelling and Deleting Jobs
You can request that a job be cancelled before it is in the `Packaging` state by calling the [Update Job Properties](../importexport/Update-Job-Properties) operation and setting the `CancelRequested` element to `true`. The job will be cancelled on a best-effort basis. If drives are in the process of transferring data, data may continue to be transferred even after cancellation has been requested.  
  
 A cancelled job will move to the `Completed` state and be kept for 90 days, at which point it will be deleted.  
  
 To delete a job, call the [Delete Job](../importexport/Delete-Job1) operation before the job has shipped (*i.e.*, while the job is in the `Creating` state). You can also delete a job when it is in the `Completed` state. After a job has been deleted, its information and status are no longer accessible via the REST API or the Azure Management Portal.
