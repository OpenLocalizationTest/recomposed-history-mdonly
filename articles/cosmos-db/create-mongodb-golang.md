# Azure Cosmos DB: Build a MongoDB API console app with Golang and the Azure portal

Azure Cosmos DB is Microsoft’s globally distributed multi-model database
service. You can quickly create and query document, key/value, and graph
databases, all of which benefit from the global distribution and horizontal
scale capabilities at the core of Azure Cosmos DB.

This quick-start demonstrates how to use an existing
[MongoDB](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/documentdb/documentdb-protocol-mongodb)
app written in Golang and connect it to your Azure Cosmos DB database, which
supports MongoDB client connections.

In other words, your Golang application only knows that it’s connecting to a
database using MongoDB APIs. It is transparent to the application that the data
is stored in Azure Cosmos DB.

We’ll cover:

* Prerequisites for this tutorial
* Creating and connecting to an Azure Cosmos DB account
* Setting up your application
* Connect to an Azure Cosmos DB account
* CRUD Operations

### Prerequisites for the Golang tutorial

1.  Basic knowledge of [GO ](https://golang.org/)language
1.  Azure subscription. (If you don’t have an Azure subscription, create a [free
account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you
begin.)
1.  IDE — [Gogland](https://www.jetbrains.com/go/) by Jetbrains or [Visual Studio
Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) by Mircosoft or [Atom](https://atom.io/)

### Creating and connecting to an Azure Cosmos DB account

1.  In a new window, sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
1.  In the left menu, click **New**, click **Databases**, and then click **Azure
Cosmos DB**.

3. In the **New account** blade, specify the desired configuration for the Azure
Cosmos DB account.

With Azure Cosmos DB, you can choose one of four programming models: Gremlin
(graph), MongoDB, SQL (DocumentDB), and Table (key-value).

In this quick start we’ll be programming against the MongoDB API so you’ll
choose **MongoDB** as you fill out the form. But if you have graph data for a
social media mes New app, document data from a catalog app, or key/value (table)
data, realize that Azure Cosmos DB can provide a highly available,
globally-distributed database service platform for all your mission-critical
applications.

Fill out the New account blade using the information in the screenshot as a
guide . You will choose unique values as you set up your account so your values
will not match the screenshot exactly

4. Click **Create** to create the account.

5. On the toolbar, click **Notifications** to monitor the deployment process.

6. Click on **golang-couch** resources.

7. Get connection string information which will be required by client
applications.

### Setting up your application

It’s time to make our hands dirty. Open your favorite editor (Gogland, VS Code
or Atom). For this article, I will use Gogland editor.

1.  Create folder CosmosDBAcces folder inside GOROOT\src folder
1.  Run below command to get mgo package

    go get gopkg.in/mgo.v2

### Connect to an Azure Cosmos DB account

[mgo](http://labix.org/mgo) (pronounced as *mango*) is a
[MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org/) driver for the [Go
language](http://golang.org/) that implements a rich and well tested selection
of features under a very simple API following standard Go idioms.

Azure Cosmos DB uses latest version of MongoDB v3.2.0. with SSL enabled.

To check MongoDb version go to Azure portal and get MongoDB Shell Tab and copy
mongo command

![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*voTl_TbS7Wuld2Q4CBLFXQ.png)
<span class="figcaption_hack">Azure Cosmos MongoDB Shell</span>

Open command prompt and run command. Once the connection is established, run
below command to check database version.

    db.version()

Officially, mgo does not support MongoDB 3.2 version. There is solution to
ignore server certificate validation by mgo. Please refer blog [Connect to
MongoDB 3.2 on Compose from
Golang](https://www.compose.com/articles/connect-to-mongo-3-2-on-compose-from-golang/)
by [Hays Hutton](about:invalid#zSoyz)

To get started we have to configure transport layer security (tls). We have to
make sure that client Certificate Authority ignore SSL validation. While this
does open up some attack vectors, it is is better than no SSL. Here are the
comments directly from the source code of the **tls.Config** struct for the
particular boolean we need to set:


The following code snippet to connect with MongoDB with GO app. DialInfo holds
options for establishing a session with a MongoDB cluster.

```go
tlsConfig := &tls.Config{}

// InsecureSkipVerify controls whether a client verifies the
// server's certificate chain and host name.
// If InsecureSkipVerify is true, TLS accepts any certificate
// presented by the server and any host name in that certificate.
// In this mode, TLS is susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks.
// This should be used only for testing.
tlsConfig.InsecureSkipVerify = true

// DialInfo holds options for establishing a session with a MongoDB cluster.
dialInfo := &mgo.DialInfo{
    Addrs:    []string{"golang-couch.documents.azure.com:10255"}, // Get HOST + PORT
    Timeout:  60 * time.Second,
    Database: "golang-couch", // It can be anything
    Username: "golang-couch", // Username
    Password: "Password from MongoDB Setting in azure portal", // PASSWORD
}

dialInfo.DialServer = func(serverAddress *mgo.ServerAddr) (net.Conn, error) {
    fmt.Println(serverAddress.String());
    connection, err := tls.Dial("tcp", serverAddress.String(), tlsConfig)
    return connection, err

}

// Create a session which maintains a pool of socket connections
// to our MongoDB.
session, err := mgo.DialWithInfo(dialInfo)

if err != nil {
    fmt.Printf("Can't connect to mongo, go error %v\n", err)
    os.Exit(1)
}

defer session.Close()

// SetSafe changes the session safety mode.
// If the safe parameter is nil, the session is put in unsafe mode, // and writes become fire-and-forget,
// without error checking. The unsafe mode is faster since operations won't hold on waiting for a confirmation.
// 
session.SetSafe(&mgo.Safe{})
```
**mgo.Dial()** method is used when there is no SSL connection and for SSL
connection **mgo.DialWithInfo()** method is required.

Instance of **DialWIthInfo{}** object will be used to create session object.
Once session is established, we can access collection by following code snippet

```go
   collection := session.DB(“golang-couch”).C(“package”)
```
### CRUD Operations

#### 1. Create Document

```go
// Model
type Package struct {
    Id bson.ObjectId  `bson:"_id,omitempty"`
    FullName      string
    Description   string
    StarsCount    int
    ForksCount    int
    LastUpdatedBy string
}

// insert Document in collection
err = collection.Insert(&Package{
    FullName:"react",
    Description:"A framework for building native apps with React.",
    ForksCount: 11392,
    StarsCount:48794,
    LastUpdatedBy:"shergin",

})

if err != nil {
    log.Fatal("Problem inserting data: ", err)
    return
}
```

#### 2. Query/Read Document

Azure Cosmos DB supports rich queries against JSON documents stored in each
collection. The following sample code shows a query that you can run against the
documents in your collection.

```go
// Get Document from collection
result := Package{}
err = collection.Find(bson.M{"fullname": "react"}).One(&result)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal("Error finding record: ", err)
    return
}

fmt.Println("Description:", result.Description)
```


#### 3. Update Document

```go
// update document
updateQuery := bson.M{"_id": result.Id}
change := bson.M{"$set": bson.M{"fullname": "react-native"}}
err = collection.Update(updateQuery, change)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal("Error updating record: ", err)
    return
}
```

#### 4. Delete Document

Azure Cosmos DB supports deleting JSON documents.

```go
// delete document
query := bson.M{"_id": result.Id}
err = collection.Remove(query)
if err != nil {
    log.Fatal("Error deleting record: ", err)
    return
}
```
