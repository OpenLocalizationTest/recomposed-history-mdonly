# Azure Cosmos DB: Build a MongoDB API web app with Java and the Azure portal

Azure Cosmos DB is Microsoftâ€™s globally distributed multi-model database service. You can quickly create and query document, key/value, and graph databases, all of which benefit from the global distribution and horizontal scale capabilities at the core of Azure Cosmos DB. 

This quick start demonstrates how to create an Azure Cosmos DB account, document database, and collection using the Azure portal. You'll then build and deploy a console app built on the [MongoDB Java driver](https://docs.mongodb.com/ecosystem/drivers/java/), as shown in the following screenshot. 

## Prerequisites

* Before you can run this sample, you must have the following prerequisites:
   * JDK 1.7+ (Run `apt-get install default-jdk` if you don't have JDK)
   * Maven (Run `apt-get install maven` if you don't have Maven)

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

## Create a database account

[!INCLUDE [documentdb-create-dbaccount](../../includes/documentdb-create-dbaccount.md)]

## Add a collection

[!INCLUDE [cosmosdb-create-collection](../../includes/cosmosdb-create-collection.md)]

## Clone the sample application

Now let's clone a DocumentDB API app from github, set the connection string, and run it. You'll see how easy it is to work with data programmatically. 

1. Open a git terminal window, such as git bash, and `cd` to a working directory.  

2. Run the following command to clone the sample repository. 

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-cosmos-db-mongodb-java-getting-started.git
    ```

3. Then open the solution file in Visual Studio. 

## Review the code

Let's make a quick review of what's happening in the app. Open the `Program.cs` file and you'll find that these lines of code create the Azure Cosmos DB resources. 

* The DocumentClient is initialized.

    ```java
    MongoClientURI uri = new MongoClientURI("mongodb://<username>:<password>@<CosmosDBEndpoint>:<port>/<dbname>?ssl=true&replicaSet=globaldb");`
    ```

* A new database is created.

    ```java
    MongoDatabase database = mongoClient.getDatabase("<dbname>");

    MongoCollection<Document> collection = database.getCollection("<collname>");
    ```

* Some documents are inserted using `MongoCollection.insertMany`

    ```java
    Document document = new Document("fruit", "apple")
    collection.insertOne(document);
    ```

* Some queries are performed using `MongoCollection.find`

    ```java
    myDoc = collection.find(eq("fruit", "apple")).first();
    System.out.println(myDoc.toJson());
    ```

## Update your connection string

Now go back to the Azure portal to get your connection string information and copy it into the app.

1. In the [Azure portal](http://portal.azure.com/), in your Azure Cosmos DB account, in the left navigation click **Keys**, and then click **Read-write Keys**. You'll use the copy buttons on the right side of the screen to copy the URI and Primary Key into the web.config file in the next step.

2. Open the `Program.java` file. 

3. Copy your URI value from the portal (using the copy button) and make it the value of the `CosmosDBEndpoint` in web.config. 

4. Then copy your PRIMARY KEY value from the portal and make it the value of the `password` in web.config. You've now updated your app with all the info it needs to communicate with Azure Cosmos DB. 
    
## Run the console app

1. Run `mvn package` in a terminal to install required npm modules

2. Run `mvn exec:java -D exec.mainClass=GetStarted.Program` in a terminal to start your Java application.

You can now go back to Data Explorer and see query, modify, and work with this new data. 

## Review SLAs in the Azure portal

## Clean up resources

If you're not going to continue to use this app, delete all resources created by this quickstart in the Azure portal with the following steps:

1. From the left-hand menu in the Azure portal, click **Resource groups** and then click the name of the resource you created. 
2. On your resource group page, click **Delete**, type the name of the resource to delete in the text box, and then click **Delete**.

## Next steps

In this quickstart, you've learned how to create an Azure Cosmos DB account, create a collection using the Data Explorer, and run a web app. You can now import additional data to your Cosmos DB account.
