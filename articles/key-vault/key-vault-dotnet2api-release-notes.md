# Azure Key Vault .NET 2.0 - Release Notes and Migration Guide

The following notes and guidance are for developers working with the Azure Key Vault .NET / C# library. In the change from the 1.0 version to the 2.0 version, a number of updates have been made that will require migration work in your code in order for you to benefit from the functional improvements and feature additions such as Key Vault certificates support.

## .NET support
- **Net 4.0** is not supported by the 2.0 version of the Azure Key Vault .NET/C# library

## Namespaces
- The namespace for **models** is changed from **Microsoft.Azure.KeyVault** to **Microsoft.Azure.KeyVault.Models**.
- The **Microsoft.Azure.KeyVault.Internal** namespace is dropped.
- The Azure SDK dependencies namespace are changed from **Hyak.Common** and **Hyak.Common.Internals** to **Microsoft.Rest** and **Microsoft.Rest.Serialization**
- Some old dependencies have been dropped

- **UnixEpoch** class has been removed
- **Base64UrlConverter** class is renamed to **Base64UrlJsonConverter**

## Type changes
- *Secret* changed to *SecretBundle*
- *Dictionary* changed to *IDictionary*
- *List<T>, string []* changed to *IList<T>*
- *NextList* changed to  *NextPageLink*

## Return types
- **KeyList** and **SecretList** will return *IPage<T>* instead of *ListKeysResponseMessage*
- The generated **BackupKeyAsync** will return *BackupKeyResult* which contains *Value* (back-up blob). Before the method was wrapped and returning only the value.

## Exceptions
- *KeyVaultClientException* is changed to *KeyVaultErrorException*
- The service error is changed from *exception.Error* to *exception.Body.Error.Message*.
- Removed additional info from the error message for **[JsonExtensionData]**.

## Constructors
- Instead of accepting an *HttpClient* as a constructor argument, the constructor only accepts *HttpClientHandler* or *DelegatingHandler[]*.

- *PermissionsToKeys* and *PermissionsToSecrets* are now *Permissions.Keys* and *Permissions.Secrets*
- Some of the return types changes apply to the control-plane as well.

## Microsoft.Azure.KeyVault.Extensions NuGet
