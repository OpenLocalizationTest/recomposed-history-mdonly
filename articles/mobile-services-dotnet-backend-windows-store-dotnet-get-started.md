This tutorial shows you how to add a cloud-based backend service to a Windows Store app using Windows Azure Mobile Services. In this tutorial, you will create both a new mobile service and a simple _To do list_ app that stores app data in the new mobile service. The mobile service that you will create uses the supported .NET languages using Visual Studio for server-side business logic and to manage the mobile service. To create a mobile service that lets you write your server-side business logic in JavaScript, see the [JavaScript backend version] of this topic.

A screenshot from the completed app is below:

Completing this tutorial is a prerequisite for all other Mobile Services tutorials for Windows Store apps. 

>[WACOM.NOTE]To complete this tutorial, you need a Windows Azure account. If you don't have an account, you can create a free trial account in just a couple of minutes. For details, see <a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial/?WT.mc_id=A0E0E5C02&amp;returnurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.windowsazure.com%2Fen-us%2Fdocumentation%2Farticles%2Fmobile-services-dotnet-backend-windows-store-get-started%2F" target="_blank">Windows Azure Free Trial</a>.<br />This tutorial requires <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwLink/p/?LinkID=257546" target="_blank">Visual Studio Professional 2013</a>. A free trial version is available.

## Create a new mobile service

[WACOM.INCLUDE [mobile-services-dotnet-backend-create-new-service](../includes/mobile-services-dotnet-backend-create-new-service.md)]

## Create a new Windows Store app

Once you have created your mobile service, you can follow an easy quickstart in the Management Portal to either create a new app or modify an existing app to connect to your mobile service. 

In this section you will create a new Windows Store app that is connected to your mobile service.

1. In the Management Portal, click **Mobile Services**, and then click the mobile service that you just created.
   
2. In the quickstart tab, click **Windows** under **Choose platform** and expand **Create a new Windows Store app**.

   	![][6]

   	This displays the three easy steps to create a Windows Store app connected to your mobile service.

  	![][7]

3. If you haven't already done so, download and install <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwLink/p/?LinkID=257546" target="_blank">Visual Studio Professional 2013</a> on your local computer or virtual machine.

4. Under **Download and run your app and service locally**, select a language for your Windows Store app, then click **Download**. 

  	This downloads a solution contains projects for both the mobile service and for the sample _To do list_ application that is connected to your mobile service. Save the compressed project file to your local computer, and make a note of where you save it.

5. Under **Publish your service to the cloud**, download your publish profile, save the downloaded file to your local computer, and make a note of where you save it.

## Test the app against the local mobile service

[WACOM.INCLUDE [mobile-services-dotnet-backend-test-local-service-dotnet](../includes/mobile-services-dotnet-backend-test-local-service-dotnet.md)]

## Publish your mobile service

[WACOM.INCLUDE [mobile-services-dotnet-backend-publish-service](../includes/mobile-services-dotnet-backend-publish-service.md)]

<ol start="4">
<li><p>In the Windows Store app project, open the App.xaml.cs file, locate the code that creates a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/Windowsazure/microsoft.windowsazure.mobileservices.mobileserviceclient.aspx" target="_blank">MobileServiceClient</a> instance, comment-out the code that creates this client using <em>localhost</em> and uncomment the code that creates the client using the remote mobile service URL, which looks like the following:</p>

        <pre><code>public static MobileServiceClient MobileService = new MobileServiceClient(
            "https://<your_mobile_service>.azure-mobile.net/",
            "XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX"
        );</code></pre>

	<p>The client will now access the mobile service published to Windows Azure.</p></li>

<li><p>Press the <strong>F5</strong> key to rebuild the project and start the app.</p></li>

<li><p>In the app, type meaningful text, such as <em>Complete the tutorial</em>, in <strong>Insert a TodoItem</strong>, and then click <strong>Save</strong>.</p>

<p>This sends a POST request to the new mobile service hosted in Windows Azure.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<!--This should be in the list HTMLK, but there is a bug-->
