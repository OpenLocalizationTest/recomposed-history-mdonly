# Enterprise integration agreements

## Overview
Agreements are the cornerstone of B2B communications, allowing business entities to communicate seamlessly using industry standard protocols.  

## What is an agreement?

An agreement is a communications arrangement between B2B trading partners. An agreement is based on the communications the partners wish to achieve and is protocol or transport specific.

Enterprise integration supports three protocol/transport standards:

- [AS2](./app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-as2.md)
- [X12](./app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-x12.md)
- [EDIFACT](./app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-edifact.md) (coming soon)

## Why use agreements?
Some of the common benefits of using agreements are:
- Enables different organizations and businesses to be able to exchange information in a well known format.
- Improves efficiency when conducting B2B transactions
- Easy to create, manage and use them when creating enterprise integration apps

## How to create agreements?
### Here's what you need before you get started
- An [integration account](./app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-accounts.md) defined in your Azure subscription
- At least two [partners](./app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-partners.md) already defined in your integration account  

>[AZURE.NOTE]When creating an agreement, the content in the agreement file must match the agreement type. 

### Create an agreement
After you've [created an integration account](./app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-accounts.md) and [added partners](./app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-partners.md), you can create an agreement by following these steps: 

#### From the Azure portal home page

After you log into the [Azure portal](http://portal.azure.com "Azure portal"):  
1. Select **Browse** from the menu on the left.  
>[AZURE.TIP]If you don't see the **Browse** link, you may need to expand the menu first. Do this by selecting the **Show menu** link that's located at the top left of the collapsed menu.

2. Type *integration* into the filter search box then select **Integration Accounts** from the list of results.       
 ![](./media/app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-overview/overview-2.png)  
3. In the **Integration Accounts** blade that opens up, select the integration account in which you will create the agreement. If you don't see any integration accounts lists, [create one first](./app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-accounts.md "All about integration accounts").  
![](./media/app-service-logic-enterprise-integration-overview/overview-3.png)  
4.  Select the **Agreements** tile. If you don't see the agreements tile, add it first.

Here are a few details you may find useful when configuring the settings for your agreement: 
  
|Property|Description|
|----|----|
|Host Partner|An agreement needs both a host and guest partner. The host partner represents the organization that is configuring the agreement.|
|Host Identity|An identifier for the host partner. This is used for todo: _______ |
|Guest Partner|An agreement needs both a host and guest partner. The guest partner represents the organization that's doing business with the host partner.|
|Guest Identity|An identifier for the guest partner. This is used for todo: _______ |
|Receive Settings|These properties apply to all messages received by an agreement|
|Send Settings|These properties apply to all messages sent by an agreement|  
Let's continue:  
7. Select **Receive Settings** to configure how messages received via this agreement are to be handled.  
 
 - Optionally, you can override the properties in the incoming message. To do this, select the **Override message properties** checkbox.
  - Select the **Message should be signed** checkbox if you'd like to require all incoming messages to be signed. If you select this option, you will also need to select the **Certificate** that will be used to validate the signature on the messages.
  - Optionally, you can require messages to be encrypted as well. To do this, select the **Message should be encrypted** checkbox. You would then need to select the **Certificate** that will be used to decode the incoming messages.
  - You can also require messages to be compressed. To do this, select the **Message should be compressed** checkbox.
