# Use switch statement in Logic Apps
When creating a workflow, you often need to take different actions based on the value of an object or expression, this can be achieved by using a switch statement.

With switch statement, Logic App evaluates a token or expression, and choose the case with the same value to execute actions within. Cases must be a static and unique value.

## Prerequisites

- Active Azure subscriptions
	- If you don't have an active Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/), or try [Logic Apps for free](https://tryappservice.azure.com/).
- [Basic knowledge of Logic Apps](./app-service-logic-what-are-logic-apps?toc=%2fazure%2flogic-apps%2ftoc.json).

## Working with switch statement in designer
To demonstrate the usage of switch statement, let's create a Logic App that monitors file uploaded to Dropbox and send out an approval email to have it transferred to SharePoint. We will use switch statement to take different actions depending on the value approver selected.

1. Start by create a Logic App, and select **Dropbox - When a file is created** trigger.

2. Follow up the trigger with an **Outlook.com - Send approval email** action.

 > [!TIP]
 > Logic Apps also supports approval email scenario from an Office 365 Outlook account.

 - If you don't have an existing connection, you will be prompted to create one.
 - Fill in required fields, we will send email to approvers@contoso.com.
 - Under *User Options*, enter *Approve, Reject*.
 - Feel free to explore other available inputs under *Advanced options*.

3. Add a switch statement.
 - Select **+ New step**, **... More**, **Add a switch statement**.
 - We want to select what to execute based on `SelectedOptions` output of the *Send approval email* action, you can find it in the **Add dynamic content** selector.
 - Use *Case 1* to handle when user selected `Approve`.
  - If approved, copy the original file to SharePoint Online with **SharePoint Online - Create file** action.
  - also send an email notify 
 - Add another case to handle when user selected `Rejected`.
  - When rejected, we will 
 - If you added any additional options in previous steps, feel free to add additional cases to handle them.

 > [!NOTE]
 > Switch statement should have at least one case in additional to the default case.

4. After the switch statement, delete the original file uploaded to Dropbox with **Dropbox - Delete file** action.

5. Save your Logic App, and test it by uploading a file to Dropbox. You should receive an approval email shortly after, select an option and observe the behavior.
 > [!TIP]
 > Check out how to [monitor your Logic Apps](app-service-logic-monitor-your-logic-apps.md).

## Understand code behind
Now you have successfully created a Logic App using switch statement. Let's look at the code behind as follows.

```json
"Switch": {
	"type": "Switch",
	"expression": "",
	"cases": {
		"Case 1" : {
			"case" : "",
			"actions" : {}
		}
	},
	"default": {
		"actions": {}
	},
	"runAfter": {}
}
```

`"Switch"` is the name of the switch statement, it can be renamed for readability. `"type": "Switch"` indicates the action is a switch statement. `"expression"` is evaluated against each case label declared later in the definition. `"cases"` can contain any number of cases, and if none of the cases match the switch expression, actions within `"default"` is executed.

There can be any number of cases inside `"cases"`. For each case, `"Case 1"` is the name of the case, it can be renamed for readability. `"case"` specify the case label, which the switch expression compares with, it must be a constant and unique value.
