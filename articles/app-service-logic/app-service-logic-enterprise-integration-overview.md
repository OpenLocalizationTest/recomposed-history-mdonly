# Enterprise Integration (EI)

## Overview
The Enterprise Integration suite is Microsoft's solution for seamlessly facilitating B2B communications using industry standard protocols including AS2, X12 and Edifact (coming soon). It allows organizations that use different protocols and formats to exchange messages electronically by transforming the different messages into a common format. If you are familiar with BizTalk Server, you'll find it easy to use the Enterprise Integration features.

### What is EIP?

- Talk about limits here (size of uploads?, others)  
- How it relates to BizTalk scenarios
- How it relates to v1 of logic apps schema?
- Moving from earlier versions (V1, MABS, etc.)
- Relationship with App service/API apps and Logic apps

### Why should you use EIP?
#### Key features that solve customer problems

### How to use EIP?
You can build and manage B2B apps using Enterprise Integration via the Logic apps designer on the **Azure portal** or by using PowerShell. 

#### Azure Management Portal


#### PowerShell


## What are come common scenarios?
- incoming order, transformed for internal system --> Order processed -> Order confirmation returned to customer
- Jon: VETER -- reference in the MABS docs ... leverage that doc here
- EDI
- EAI
- etc.


## How much does it cost?
For pricing information and a list of what is included with each service tier, see [Azure App Service Pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/app-service/).

## Want to get started now?

### Here's what you need to get going fast

- An Azure subscription (anything else special in Azure? Any region limitations, etc.?)  
- Visual Studio -- Is this required only for some scenarios? If yes, which ones? -- needed to create maps & schemas in vS
- An integration account
- dfdfdfdf
