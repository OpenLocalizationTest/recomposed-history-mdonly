# Maps

## Overview
Enterprise integration uses maps to transform XML data from one format to another format. 

## What is it?
A map is an XML document that defines who data in a document should be transformed into another format. 

## Why would I use it?
Let's assume you regularly receive B2B orders or invoices from a customers who uses the YYYMMDD format for dates. However, in your organization, you store dates in the MMDDYYY format. You can use a map to *transform* the YYYMMDD date format into the MMDDYYY before storing the order or invoice details in your customer activity database.

## How to create it?

7. The map is now being provisioned into your integration account. This will receive an onscreen notification that indicates the success or failure of adding the map file. Select the **Maps** tile, you will then see your newly added map in the Maps blade:    

8. Select the **Maps** tile. This refreshes the tile and you should see the number of maps increase, reflecting the new map that has been added successfully.
