# Diagnosing Logic Apps

If you are experiencing any issues or failures with a Logic App, there are a few approaches you can take to better understand where the failures are coming from.  

## Management Portal Tools

The Azure Portal provides many tools to diagnose each Logic App at each step.

### Trigger History

Each Logic App has at least one trigger.  If you are noticing apps that aren't firing, the first place to start is the trigger history.  You can access the trigger history from the Logic App main blade here:

![][1]

This will list all of the attempts your Logic App has made to trigger.  Each of these entries can be clicked on to get the next level of detail (specifically any inputs or outputs that were generated by the trigger attempt).  If you notice any 'Failed' triggers, you should click into the trigger attempt and drill into the Outputs Link to understand any error messages that may be being generated (for example: invalid FTP credentials).

The different statuses you may see are:

* Skipped - it polled the endpoint to check to see if data was available and got back a response that no data was available.
* Succeeded - the trigger received a response that data was available.  This could be from a manual trigger, recurrence trigger, or polling trigger.  This will likely be accompanied with a 'Fired', but may not if you have a condition or splitOn in code-view that wasn't satisfied.
* Failed - an error was generated.

#### Start a trigger manually

If you want the Logic App to check for an available trigger immediately (without waiting for the next recurrence) you can always click the "Select Trigger" button on the main blade to force a check.  For example, clicking this with a Dropbox trigger will cause the workflow to poll Dropbox immediately for new files.

### Run History

Whenever a trigger is fired, it results in a run.  Runs can be accessed from the main blade and contain a lot of information helpful in understanding what happened during the flow.

A run can have any of the following status':

* Succeeded - all actions succeeded, or if there was a failure it was handled by an action later in the workflow (i.e. an action was set to run after a 'Failed' action).
* Failed - at least one action had a failure that was not handled by an action later in the workflow.
* Cancelled - the workflow was running but received a request to cancel.
* Running - if a workflow is currently running.  This may occur for flows that are being throttled as well with the current App Service Plan.  Please see action limits on the [pricing page](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/app-service/plans/) for details.  Configuring Diagnostics (charts below run history) will also let you know about any throttle events that are occuring.

Once you are within a run, you can drill in more to details.  

#### Trigger Outputs

Trigger Outputs will show you the data that was received from the trigger.  This can be useful in understanding if all properties are being returned as expected.

>[AZURE.NOTE] It may be helpful to understand how Logic Apps [handles different content types](app-service-logic-content-type.md) if you see any content you don't understand.

![][3]

#### Action Inputs and Outputs

You can drill into the inputs and outputs that an action received.  This is useful for understanding the size and shape of the outputs, as well as to see any error messages that may have been generated.
