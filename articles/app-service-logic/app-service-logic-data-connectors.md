# Data Connectors in Microsoft Azure App Service

> [AZURE.NOTE] This topic is being retired. Refer to the [Connectors and API Apps List ](app-service-logic-connectors-list.md) to see all the available built-in Connectors and API apps. 


## What is an App + Data Services API App Connector
App and Data Services connectors are "API Apps" that can connect to a wide array of data services applications and perform several *Actions* on behalf of the authenticated user. Most of these connectors can also be configured with a *Trigger*. Triggers are events (similar to events in the .NET Framework) that can be configured on some connectors to initiate a workflow. 

For example, an instance of the Dropbox connector can be configured with a *new file* trigger where the trigger executes any time a new file is added to the Dropbox account that's being monitored. This trigger can then be configured to initiate an *Action* that will *Get* the file and upload it to an on-premises SharePoint list.


Here's a brief overview of each of the App and Data Services connectors that are available on the Azure gallery:

## Why Use Connectors?

Connectors accelerate app development and even allow non-developers to create fully functional, enterprise grade applications without having to learn a programming language or write any code.

Now that you have an idea of what our App + data services connectors can do, let's look at some simple use cases for these connectors. 

### Monitoring your Dropbox and updating SharePoint
Imagine your company is a construction firm that receives very large files containing blueprints. These files are typically too large to be handled via email so your company sets up a Dropbox account and asks its customers to drop the blueprints into the Dropbox. You could then ask each employee to constantly check the Dropbox folders for new blueprints then upload them to your SharePoint server, however, you are convinced there must be a better way! Luckily, you found out that Microsoft recently released its App + data services connector for Dropbox, Sharepoint and other data services. You can easily create connectors for Dropbox and SharePoint, add them to a Logic app and configure them to upload each new file  from your Dropbox account to your SharePoint list. Since the Dropbox connector has a *new message* trigger, you can use it to notify your Logic app that there is a new file available. The Dropbox connector can then download the file. Your Sharepoint connector can then be configured to upload the file to a SharePoint list using the SharePoint *upload* action. You can do this all, without writing a single line of code.  

Let's get started. 

## Create a Connector
Connector API Apps can be created using the Azure Portal

### Create a SharePoint Connector in the Microsoft Azure Portal

1. In the Azure portal, select **NEW** > **Web + mobile** > **Azure Marketplace**
2. **Search** for the connector or select it from the list. Once selected, a new blade or window opens. Select **Create**. 
3. Enter the following properties for the connector: 

Property|Description
--|--
Name|Enter any name for your API App. For example, you can name it RulesDiscountTaxCode or APIAppValidateXML
App Service Plan|Lists your payment plan. You can change it if you need more or less resources
Pricing Tier|Read-only property that lists the pricing category within your Azure subscription.
Resource Group|Create a new one or use an existing group. Using resource groups explains this property
Subscription|Read-only property that lists your current subscription
Location|The Geographic location that hosts your Azure service 
Add to Startboard|Select this to add the API App to your Starboard (the home page)

4. Select **Create**. Your connector will be created. It may take a while to complete and the Home screen will be displayed during the creation of the connector. Use the Notifications menu item on the left to monitor the status of your connector.

Now that you've created your first connector, consider building a web, mobile or logic app with it. 


### Access Connector using REST APIs

## Add your connector to an application 
Microsoft Azure App Service exposes different application types that can use these Connectors. For example, you can create a *Logic* app by combining one or more of your connectors *logically* into a single app.

To use your connectors within your *Logic* app, you select a per-configured connector from the list, add it to your design work-flow, make the needed configuration changes and its ready to be used. 

To follow these steps, you need a Web App, Mobile App, or Logic App. See <> for the specific steps. Once your application is available, add your connectors. Here's how:

Use the following steps to add a connector to a Logic App: 

1. In the Azure portal Startboard (home page), go to the **Marketplace**, and search for your  Logic, Mobile, or Web App. 

	If you are creating a new App, search for Logic App, Mobile App, or Web App. Select the App and in the new blade, select **Create**. [Create a Logic App](app-service-logic-create-a-logic-app.md) lists the steps. 

2. Open your App and select **Triggers and Actions**. 
3. From the **Gallery**, select the connector. It will be added to your app.
4. Configure the connector:
5. Every connector has properties that are specific to the service and environment that it is connecting to. Enter the details for the properties. Keep in mind that some properties are optional.
6. Select **OK** to save your changes.


## Security
Connectors use either OAuth or user names and passwords.
