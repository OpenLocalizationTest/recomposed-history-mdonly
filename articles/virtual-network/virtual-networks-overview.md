# Virtual Network Overview

An Azure virtual network (VNet) works similarly to a network implemented in your own datacenter. Each Azure VNet you create must have a set of CIDR address blocks, which can be divided to create subnets. You can deploy Azure virtual machines (VMs) and role instances to a VNet, and connect them to subnets, in the same way you can deploy physical and virtual machines to your on-premises datacenter. 

To better understand VNets, take a look at the figure below, which shows a traditional om-premises network.

The figure above shows an on-premises network connected to the public Internet through a router. You can also see a firewall between the router and a DMZ hosting a DNS server and a web server farm. The web server farm is load balanced using a hardware load balancer that is exposed to the Internet, and consumes resources from the internal subnet. The internal subnet is separated from the DMZ by another firewall, and hosts Active Directory Domain Controller servers, database servers, and application servers.

The same network can be hosted in Azure as shown in the figure below.

Notice how you the Azure infrastructure takes on the role of the router, allowing access from your VNet to the public Internet without the need of any configuration. Firewalls can be substituted by Network Security Groups (NSGs) applied to each individual subnet. And physical load balancers are substituted by external and internal load balancers in Azure.

## Virtual Network

Each VNet you create is completely isolated from other VNets. You can connect a VNet to any other VNet, and even to your on-premises network, as long as the CIDR address blocks used by the VNets are not overlapping. Vnets provide the following services to virtual machines (VMs) and role instances deployed to them:

- Access to the public Internet. All VMs and role instances in a VNet can access the public Internet. You can control access by using Network Security Groups (NSGs).

- Access to other VMs and role instances within the VNet. VMs can connect to other VMs in the same VNet, even if they are in different subnets, without the need to configure a gateway.

- Name resolution. Azure provides internal name resolution for VMs and role instances deployed in your VNet. You can also deploy your own DNS servers and configure the VNet to use them.

- Isolation. VNets are completely isolated from one another. That allows you to create separate VNets for development, testing, and production that use the same CIDR address blocks.

## Subnet

You need to create at least one subnet within a VNet. Each subnet has its own CIDR address block, which must be previously defined in the VNet. VMs and role instances connect to a subnet through a network interface (NIC).

## Network Security Groups

You can create NSGs to control inbound and outbound access to network interfaces (NICs), VMs, and subnets. For instance, in the figure above, you can create an NSG for the front end subnet that allows inbound traffic from the Internet to port 80 for the front end subnet, and all inbound and outbound traffic to the backend subnet. And a separate NSG for the backend subnet that allows all inbound and outbound traffic to the front end subnet. To learn more about NSGs, visit [What is a Network Security Group](../virtual-networks-nsg.md).

## Azure Load Balancer

You can use two types of load balancers in Azure:

- External load balancer. You can use an external load balancer to expose VMs and role instances to the public Internet.

- Internal load balancer. You can use an internal load balancer to expose VMs and roles instances to apps and services running inside your VNet.
