# Network interfaces and IP addresses

Learn about network interfaces (NIC) and how to create, change, and delete them. A NIC is the interconnection between an Azure Virtual Machine (VM) and the underlying software network. The following picture illustrates the capability that a NIC provides:

![Network interface](./media/virtual-network-network-interface/nic.png)

This article explains how to work with the resources shown in the picture. Click any of the following resources to go directly to that section of the article.

- [NICs](#nics): A NIC is connected to one subnet within an Azure Virtual Network (VNet). In the picture, **VM1** has two NICs attached to it and **VM1** has one NIC attached to it. Each NIC is connected to the same VNet, but to different subnets. This section provides steps to list existing NICs, and create, change, and delete NICs. 
- [IP configurations](#ip-configs): One or more IP configurations are associated to each NIC. Each IP configuration has a private IP address assigned to it and may have a public IP address resource associated to it. In the picture, **NIC1** and **NIC3** each have one IP configuration associated to them, while **NIC2** has two IP configurations associated to it. This section provides steps to create, change, and delete IP configurations with private IP addresses assigned using the static and dynamic assignment methods. This section also provides steps to assign public IP address resources to an IP configuration. 
- [Network security groups](#nsgs): Network security groups contain one or more inbound or outbound security rules. The rules control the type of network traffic that can flow into and out of a network interface, a subnet, or both. In the picture, **NIC1** and **NIC3** have an NSG associated to them, whereas **NIC2** does not. This section provides steps to view the network security groups applied to a NIC, add an NSG to a NIC, and remove an NSG from a NIC.
- [Public IP address resources](#public-ips): Public IP address resources have multiple settings, one of which is a public IP address. In the picture, **icponfig1** for **NIC1** and **ipconfig1** for **NIC3** have public IP addresses assigned to them, but a public IP address resource is not associated to either of the IP configurations for **NIC2**. This section provides steps to create, change, and delete public IP address resources, including assigning public IP addresses with the static and dynamic assignment methods. 
- [VMs](#vms): A VM has at least one NIC attached to it, but can have several NICs attached to it, depending on the VM size. This section provides steps to create single and multi-NIC VMs, as well as attach and detach NICs to and from existing VMs.

If you're new to network interfaces and VMs in Azure, we recommend you complete the exercise in the [Create your first Azure Virtual Network](virtual-network-get-started-vnet-subnet.md) before reading this article. The exercise helps familiarize you with VNets and VMs. This article applies to VMs and NICs created through the Azure Resource Manager deployment model. Microsoft recommends creating resources through the Resource Manager deployment model, rather than the classic deployment model. Read the [Understand Azure deployment models](../azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-deployment-model.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json) article if you're not familiar with the differences between the two models.

The remaining sections of this article provide steps to complete all NIC-related tasks. Each section lists:
- Steps to complete the task within the Azure portal. To complete the steps you must be logged in to the [Azure portal](http://portal.azure.com). If you're using an individual account, you can complete any of the tasks in this article. If your account is part of an organization, ensure that your account permissions and Azure policies enable you to complete the tasks. Sign-up for a [free trial account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free) if you don't already have one.
- Commands to complete the task using Azure PowerShell with links to the command reference for the command. Install and configure PowerShell by completing the steps in the [How to Install and Configure Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azureps-cmdlets-docs?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json) article. To get help for PowerShell commands, with examples, type `get-help <command> -full`.
- Commands to complete the task using the Azure Command-line interface (CLI) with links to the command reference for the command. Install the Azure CLI by completing the steps in the [How to Install and Configure the Azure CLI 2.0](/cli/azure/install-az-cli?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json) article. To get help for CLI commands, type `az <command> -h`.

## <a name="work-with-nics"></a>Network interfaces
Complete the steps in the following sections to create, view, change, and delete network interfaces and settings:

### <a name="create-nic"></a>Create a network interface

To use a NIC, it must be attached to a VM, but it can exist without being attached to a VM. To learn how to attach a NIC to a VM, read the [Attach and detach NICs to or from a virtual machine](#vms) section of this article.

To create a NIC, complete the following steps:

1. Log in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with an account that is assigned the Owner, Contributor, or Network Contributor role for your subscription. @@@ Confirm these are the correct roles @@@ Read the [Built-in roles for Azure role-based access control](../active-directory/role-based-access-built-in-roles.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json#network-contributor) article to learn more about assigning roles to accounts.
2. In the box that contains the text *Search resources* at the top of the Azure portal, type *network interfaces*. When **network interfaces** appears in the search results, click it.
3. In the **Network interfaces** blade that appears, click **+ Add**.
4. In the **Create network interface** blade that appears, enter, or select values for the following settings then click **Create**:
	
	|**Setting**|**Required?**|**Details**|
	|---|---|---|
	|**Name**|Yes|The name cannot be changed after the NIC is created. The name must be unique within the resource group you select. Read the [Naming conventions](../architecture/best-practices/naming-conventions) article for naming suggestions.|
	|**Virtual network**|Yes|You can only connect a NIC to a VNet that exists in the same subscription and location as the NIC. The VM the NIC is attached to must also exist in the same location and subscription. If no VNets are listed, you need to create one. To create a VNet, complete the steps in the [Virtual network](virtual-networks-create-vnet-arm-pportal.md) article. Once a NIC is created, you cannot change the VNet it is connected to.|
	|**Subnet**|Yes|You can change the subnet the NIC is connected to after it's created.|
	|**Private IP address assignment**|Yes| A private IP address is assigned by the Azure DHCP server to the NIC when it's created. The DHCP server assigns an available address from the subnet address range defined for the subnet you connect the NIC to. **Dynamic:** A dynamic address may change when a VM is started after having been put into the stopped (deallocated) state. The address remains the same if the VM is rebooted or stopped (but not deallocated). **Static:** Static addresses do not change until the VM the NIC is attached to is deleted, the NIC is deleted, or the NIC is detached from a VM and assigned to a different VM. You can change the assignment method after the NIC is created.|
	|**Network security group**|No|Network security groups enable you to control the flow of network traffic in and out of a NIC. To learn more about NSGs, read the [Network security groups](virtual-networks-nsg.md) article. You can apply zero or one network security group (NSG) to a NIC. Zero or one NSG can also be applied to the subnet the NIC is connected to. When an NSG is applied to a NIC and the subnet it's connected to, sometimes unexpected results occur. To troubleshoot NSGs applied to NICs, read the [Troubleshoot NSGs](virtual-network-nsg-troubleshoot-portal.md#view-effective-security-rules-for-a-network-interface) article.|
	|**Subscription**|Yes| You can move the NIC to another subscription after you create it.|
	|**Resource group**|Yes|You can move the NIC to a different resource group after the NIC is created.|
	|**Location**|Yes|You cannot move the NIC to a different location after the NIC is created.|

The Azure portal creates a primary IP configuration named **ipconfig1** with a dynamic private IP address, and associates it to the NIC you create. To learn more about IP configurations, read the [IP configurations](#ip-configs) section of this article. You cannot specify the name of the IP configuration the portal creates, nor can you specify that a static private IP address be assigned to the IP configuration. If you create the NIC using PowerShell or the CLI, you can specify the name of the IP configuration and the assignment method for the private IP address. You can also change the private IP address assignment method by completing the steps in the [Change an IP configuration](#change-ipconfig) section of this article. 

>[!Note]
> Azure assigns a MAC address to the NIC only after the NIC is attached to a VM and the VM is started the first time. You cannot specify the MAC address that Azure assigns to the NIC. The MAC address remains assigned to the NIC until the VM the NIC is attached to is deleted or the NIC is detached from the VM.

|**CLI**|[az network nic list](/cli/azure/network/nic#list) to view NICs in the subscription. [az network nic show](/cli/azure/network/nic#show) to see settings for a NIC.|
|**PowerShell**|[Get-AzureRmNetworkInterface](/powershell/resourcemanager/azurerm.network/v3.4.0/get-azurermnetworkinterface) to view NICs in the subscription or show settings for a NIC.|

### <a name="dns"></a>Change DNS settings for a NIC

To change the DNS settings for a NIC, complete the following steps. The DNS server is assigned to the VM by the Azure DHCP server. To learn more about name resolution settings for a NIC, read the [Name resolution for VMs](virtual-networks-name-resolution-for-vms-and-role-instances.md) article.

1. Complete steps 1-3 in the [View and change network interfaces and settings](#view-nics) section of this article for the NIC you want to change settings for.
2. In the blade for the NIC you selected, click **DNS servers**.
3. Click either:
	- **Inherit from virtual network (default)**: Choose this option to inherit the DNS server setting defined for the virtual network the NIC is connected to. At the VNet level, either a custom DNS server or the Azure-provided DNS server is defined. The Azure-provided DNS server can resolve names for resources connected to the same VNet, but not in other VNets.
	- **Custom**: Enter the IP address of the server you want to use as a DNS server. The DNS server address you specify is assigned only to this NIC and overrides any DNS setting for the VNet the NIC is connected to.
4. Click **Save**. If the VM is a member of an availability set, Azure will restart the VM, and any other VMs in the same availability set. @@@ This was not my experience. I changed the DNS from inherit to a specific IP address and the VM did not reboot. I restarted it and the VM did receive the DNS server I specified from DHCP though. @@@

|**Tool**|**Command**|
|---|---|
|**CLI**|[az network nic update](/cli/azure/network/nic#update) with the `--set dnsSettings.dnsServers <ip-address>` argument @@@ Is this correct? I tried using a couple of IP addresses and was returned an error saying it wasn't a valid IP address (but it was valid). @@@|
|**PowerShell**|[Set-AzureRmNetworkInterface](/powershell/resourcemanager/azurerm.network/v3.4.0/set-azurermnetworkinterface) @@@ Is this correct? @@@|

### <a name="ip-forwarding"></a>Change IP forwarding for a NIC

If you have a VM with multiple NICs that you want to forward network traffic between, you must enable IP forwarding for each NIC. Multiple NICs are a common requirement for VMs deployed as network virtual appliances, such as firewalls. The IP forwarding setting simply enables a VM to forward network traffic not destined for the NIC it's sent to. Even with IP forwarding enabled, the software running in the NVA must be able to forward packets between interfaces. You can view a list of ready to deploy NVAs in the [Azure Marketplace](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/marketplace/apps/category/networking?page=1&subcategories=appliances).

IP forwarding is typically used with user-defined routes. To learn more about user-defined routes, read the [User-defined routes](virtual-networks-udr-overview.md) article. To change IP forwarding settings for a NIC, complete the following steps:

1. Complete steps 1-3 in the [View and change network interfaces and settings](#view-nics) section of this article for the NIC you want to modify.
2. In the blade for the NIC you selected, click IP configurations
3. Click **Enabled** or **Disabled** (default setting) to change the setting.
4. Click **Save**.

|**Tool**|**Command**|
|---|---|
|**CLI**|[az network nic update](/cli/azure/network/nic#update)|
|**PowerShell**|[Set-AzureRmNetworkInterface](/powershell/resourcemanager/azurerm.network/v3.4.0/set-azurermnetworkinterface) @@@ Is this correct? @@@ |

### <a name="subnet"></a>Change the subnet a NIC is connected to

You can change the subnet, but not the VNet, that a NIC is connected to. To change the subnet, all IP configurations associated to the NIC must be assigned dynamic private IP addresses. To change the subnet a NIC is connected to, complete the following steps:

1. Complete steps 1-3 in the [View and change network interfaces and settings](#view-nics) section of this article for the NIC you want to connect to a different subnet.
2. Click **IP configurations** in the blade for the NIC you selected. If any private IP addresses for any IP configurations listed have a private IP address assigned with the static method, you must change the method to dynamic by completing the steps that follow. If the addresses are assigned with the dynamic method, you can skip these steps:
	- Click the static IP address for the IP configuration you want to change from the list of IP configurations.
	- In the blade that appears for the IP configuration, click **Dynamic** for the **Assignment** method.
	- Click **Save**.
3. Select the subnet you want to connect the NIC to from the **Subnet** drop-down list.
4. Click **Save**.

|**Tool**|**Command**|
|---|---|
|**CLI**|[az network nic ip-config update](/cli/azure/network/nic/ip-config#update)|
|**PowerShell**|[Set-AzureRmNetworkInterfaceIpConfig](/powershell/resourcemanager/azurerm.network/v3.4.0/set-azurermnetworkinterfaceipconfig)|


### <a name="delete-nic"></a>Delete a network interface

You can delete a NIC as long as it's not attached to a VM. If it is attached to a VM, you must first detach it from the VM before you can delete it. To detach a NIC from a VM, complete the steps in the [Detach a NIC from a virtual machine](#vm-detach-nic) section of this article.

1. Complete steps 1-2 in the [View and change network interfaces and settings](#view-nics) section of this article for the NIC you want to delete.
2. Right-click the NIC you want to delete and click **Delete**.
3. Click **Yes** to confirm deletion of the NIC.

When you delete a NIC, any MAC or IP addresses assigned to it are released.

|**Tool**|**Command**|
|---|---|
|**CLI**|[az network nic list](/cli/azure/network/nic#list) to view a list of NICs, [az network nic delete](/cli/azure/network/nic#delete) to delete a NIC.|
|**PowerShell**|[Get-AzureRmNetworkInterface](/powershell/resourcemanager/azurerm.network/v3.1.0/get-azurermnetworkinterface) to view a list of NICs and [Remove-AzureRmNetworkInterface](/powershell/resourcemanager/azurerm.network/v3.1.0/remove-azurermnetworkinterface) to delete a NIC.|

## <a name="ip-configurations"></a>IP configurations
Each NIC has at least one IP configuration, referred to as the **Primary** configuration. A NIC may also have one or more *secondary* IP configurations associated to it. Each IP configuration:
- Has one private IP address assigned to it using the static or dynamic assignment method. Dynamic IP addresses may change if a VM is started after being in the stopped (deallocated) state. Static IP addresses are released from a NIC if the VM the NIC is attached to is deleted, the NIC is detached from a VM, or the NIC is deleted.  @@@ confirm @@@
- May have one public IP address resource associated to it.

The Azure DHCP servers assign the private IP address from the primary configuration of the NIC to the NIC within the VM operating system. 

Assigning multiple IP addresses to a NIC is helpful in scenarios such as:
- Hosting multiple websites or services with different IP addresses and SSL certificates on a single server.
- Serve as a network virtual appliance, such as a firewall or load balancer.
- The ability to add any of the private IP addresses for any of the NICs to an Azure Load Balancer back-end pool. In the past, only the primary IP address for the primary NIC could be added to a back-end pool. To learn more about how to load balance multiple IP configurations, read the [Load balancing multiple IP configurations](../load-balancer/load-balancer-multiple-ip.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json) article.

There is a limited number of public IP addresses that can be used within a subscription and a limited number of private IP addresses that can be assigned to a NIC. To learn more about these limits, read the [Azure limits](../azure-subscription-service-limits.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json#azure-resource-manager-virtual-networking-limits) article.

### <a name="create-ipconfig"></a>Add a secondary IP configuration to a NIC

You can add as many IP configurations as necessary to a NIC, within the limits listed in the [Azure limits](../azure-subscription-service-limits.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json#azure-resource-manager-virtual-networking-limits) article. To add an IP configuration to a NIC, complete the following steps:
 
1. Complete steps 1-3 in the [View network interface settings](#view) section of this article for the NIC you want to add an IP configuration to.
2. Click **IP configurations** in the blade for the NIC you selected.
3. Click **+ Add** in the blade that opens for IP configurations.
4. Specify the following, then click **OK** to close the **Add IP configuration** blade:

	|**Setting**|**Required?**|**Details**|
	|---|---|---|
	|**Name**|Yes|Must be unique for the NIC|
	|**Type**|Yes|Since you're adding an IP configuration to an existing NIC, and each NIC must have a primary IP configuration, your only option is **Secondary**.|
	|**Private IP address assignment method**|Yes|**Dynamic** addresses are released if the VM is put into the stopped (deallocated) state, the VM is deleted, the NIC is detached from the VM, or the NIC is deleted. **Static** addresses aren't released until the VM is deleted, the NIC is detached from the VM, or the NIC is deleted. @@@ CONFIRM @@@ If you click **Static**, you must also specify an IP address from the subnet address space range that is not currently in use by another IP configuration.|
	|Public IP address|No|**Disabled:** No public IP address resource is currently associated to the IP configuration. **Enabled:** Select an existing Public IP address resource, or create a new one.|

## <a name="nic-nsg"></a>Network security groups
A network security group (NSG) contains a list of inbound and outbound rules that allow or deny network traffic to a NIC. An NSG can be associated to a NIC, the subnet the NIC is connected to, or both. A NIC, and the subnet the NIC is connected to, are not required to have an NSG associated to them though. To learn more about network security groups, read the [Network security groups](virtual-networks-nsg.md) article.

## <a name="public-ip-address-resource"></a>Public IP address resource

@@@
May break out public IP address resource tasks into a separate article, since they're used by resources other than a NIC too. Thoughts?
@@@

To communicate from the Internet to a VM, or to the Internet from a VM without network address translation (NAT), the VM must have an attached NIC that has a public IP address resource associated to one of its IP configurations. To understand how NAT works in Azure, read the [Understanding outbound connections in Azure](../load-balancer/load-balancer-outbound-connections.md) article. The resource can exist without being assigned to a NIC, but must be assigned to a NIC to be used. Azure assigns public IP addresses from unique ranges for each Azure location. To view a list of ranges for each location, download the [Microsoft Azure datacenter IP ranges](https://www.microsoft.com/download/details.aspx?id=41653) document. 

Public IP addresses have a nominal charge. To view the pricing, read the [IP address pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/ip-addresses) page. There are limits to the number of public IP addresses you can use within a subscription. To view the limits, read the [Azure limits](../azure-subscription-service-limits.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json#azure-resource-manager-virtual-networking-limits) article. To create, change, or delete public IP address resources, complete the steps in the following sections:

### <a name="public-ip-address-resource-create"></a>Create a public IP address resource

To create a public IP address resource, complete the following steps:
1. Log in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with an account that is assigned the Owner, Contributor, or Network Contributor role for your subscription. Read the [Built-in roles for Azure role-based access control](../active-directory/role-based-access-built-in-roles.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json#network-contributor) article to learn more about assigning roles to accounts.
2. In the box that contains the text *Search resources* at the top of the Azure portal, type *public ip address*. When **Public IP addresses** appears in the search results, click it.
3. Click **+ Add** in the **Public IP address** blade that appears.
4. Enter or select values for the following settings in the **Create public IP address** blade that appears, then click **Create**:

	|**Setting**|Required?|**Details**|
	|---|---|---|
	|**Name**|Yes|The name must be unique within the resource group you select.|
	|**IP address assignment**|Yes|**Dynamic:** Dynamic addresses are assigned only after the public IP address resource is associated to a NIC attached to a VM and the VM is started for the first time. Dynamic addresses can change if the VM the NIC is attached to is stopped (deallocated). It will remain the same if the VM is rebooted or stopped (but not deallocated). **Static:** Static addresses are assigned when the public IP address resource is created. Static addresses do not change even if the VM is put in the stopped (deallocated) state. The address is only released if the VM the NIC is attached to is deleted, the NIC is deleted, or the NIC is detached from a VM and assigned to a different VM. You can change the assignment method after the NIC is created.||
	|**Idle timeout (minutes)**|No|How many minutes to keep a TCP or HTTP connection open without relying on clients to send keep-alive messages.|
	|**DNS name label**|No|Must be unique within the Azure location you create the resource in (across all subscriptions and all customers). The Azure public DNS service automatically registers the name and IP address so you can connect to the resource with the name. Azure appends *location.cloudapp.azure.com* (where location is the location you select) to the name you provide to create the fully-qualifed DNS name. |
	|**Subscription**|Yes|Must exist in the same subscription as the resource you want to associate the public IP address to.|
	|**Resource group**|Yes|Can exist in the same, or different, resource group as the resource you want to associate the public IP address to.|
	|**Location**|Yes|Must exist in the same location as the resource you want to associate the public IP address to.|

### <a name="public-ip-address-resource-change"></a>Change settings or delete a public IP address resource

To change or delete a public IP address resource, complete the following steps:

1. Log in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with an account that is assigned the Owner, Contributor, or Network Contributor role for your subscription. Read the [Built-in roles for Azure role-based access control](../active-directory/role-based-access-built-in-roles.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json#network-contributor) article to learn more about assigning roles to accounts.
2. In the box that contains the text *Search resources* at the top of the Azure portal, type *public ip address*. When **Public IP addresses** appears in the search results, click it.
3. In the **Public IP addresses** blade that appears, click the name of the public IP address resource you want to change settings for or delete.
4. In the blade that appears for the public IP address resource, complete one of the following options depending on whether you want to delete or change the public IP address resource
	- **Delete:** To delete the public IP address resource, click **Delete** in the **Overview** section of the blade. If the resource is currently associated to an IP configuration, it cannot be deleted. Click **Dissociate** to dissociate the resource from an IP configuration, if it's currently associated with one.
	- **Change:** Click **Configuration**. Change settings using the information in step 4 of the [Create a public IP address resource](#public-ip-address-resource-create) section of this article. To change the assignment from static to dynamic, you must first dissociate the public IP address resource from the IP configuration it's associated to. You can then change the assignment method to dynamic and click **Associate** to associate the resource to the same IP configuration, a different configuration, or you can leave it dissociated. To dissociate a public IP address resource, in the **Overview** section, click **Dissociate**.

>[!WARNING]
>When you change the assignment method from static to dynamic, you lose the static IP address assigned to the resource. The Azure public DNS servers update their tables with the static or dynamic address.

## <a name="vms"></a>Attach and detach NICs to or from a virtual machine

You can attach an existing NIC to a VM when you create it or you can attach an existing NIC to an existing VM. You can also detach a NIC from an existing VM. Though the portal creates a NIC when you create a VM, it does not allow you to:

- Specify an existing NIC to attach when creating the VM
- Specify a name for the NIC (the portal creates the NIC with a default name)
- Specify that the private IP address assigned to the NIC be static. The portal automatically assigns a dynamic private IP address, though you can change the assignment method after the portal creates the NIC.

You can use PowerShell or the CLI to:

- Customize all settings when creating a VM
- Attach an existing NIC when creating a VM
- Attaching a NIC to an existing VM
- Detach NICs from VMs

Before completing the tasks in the following sections, be aware of the following constraints and behaviors:

- The VM size must support multiple NICs. To learn how many NICs each VM size supports, read the [Windows](../virtual-machines/virtual-machines-windows-sizes.md) or [Linux](../virtual-machines/virtual-machines-linux-sizes.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json) VM sizes articles.
- By default, the first NIC attached to a VM is defined as the *primary* NIC. You can never detach the primary NIC. All other NICs attached to the VM are secondary NICs.
- By default, all outbound traffic from the VM is sent out the primary NIC. You can of course, control which NIC is used for outbound traffic within the VM's operating system.
- In the past, VMs within the same availability set were required to all have a single, or multiple, NICs. VMs with any number of NICs can now exist in the same availability set. A VM can only be added to an availability set when it's created though. To learn more about availability sets, read the [Manage the availability of Windows virtual machines in Azure](../virtual-machines/virtual-machines-windows-manage-availability.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json#configure-multiple-virtual-machines-in-an-availability-set-for-redundancy) article.
- While NICs can be connected to different subnets within a VNet, all NICs attached to a VM must be connected to the same VNet.

### <vm-create-windows></a>Attach a NIC when creating a Windows virtual machine

To attach an existing NIC when creating a Windows VM using PowerShell, complete the steps in the [Create a Windows VM using PowerShell](../virtual-machines/virtual-machines-windows-ps-create.md) article. To create a NIC with custom settings, skip the steps to create a NIC in the article. Complete the steps in the [Create a network interface](#create-nic) section of this article instead.

To attach multiple NICs to the VM configuration when following the steps in the article, run the `Add-AzureRmVMNetworkInterface` command once for each NIC you want to add to the VM. Add `-Primary` to the command for the NIC you want to designate as the primary NIC.

### <vm-create-linux></a>Attach a NIC when creating a Linux virtual machine

To attach an existing NIC when creating a Linux VM using the CLI, complete the steps in the [Create a Linux VM using the Azure CLI 2.0](../virtual-machines/virtual-machines-linux-quick-create-cli.md) article. To create a NIC with custom settings, skip the steps to create a NIC in the article and instead, complete the steps in the [Create a network interface](#create-nic) section of this article.

- To attach a single NIC to the VM, add the `--nics <nic-name>` parameter to the `az vm create` command in the article.
- To attach multiple NICs when creating a VM, add the `--nics <nic-name1> <nic-name2>` parameters to the `az vm create` command. The first NIC you add is automatically designated as the primary NIC.

### <vm-view-nic></a> View NICs attached to a virtual machine

1.Log in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) with an account that is assigned the Owner, Contributor, or Network Contributor role for your subscription. Read the [Built-in roles for Azure role-based access control](../active-directory/role-based-access-built-in-roles.md?toc=%2fazure%2fvirtual-network%2ftoc.json#network-contributor) article to learn more about assigning roles to accounts.
2. In the box that contains the text *Search resources* at the top of the Azure portal, type *virtual machines*. When **virtual machines** appears in the search results, click it.
3. In the **Virtual machines** blade that appears, click the name of the VM you want to view attached network interfaces for.
4. In the **Virtual machine** blade that appears for the VM you selected, click **Network interfaces**.

### <vm-attach-nic></a>Attach a NIC to an existing virtual machine

The VM you want to attach a NIC to must support multiple NICs and be in the stopped (deallocated) state. @@@ I tried to add a NIC to a VM that supports multiple NICs but was created with one. It fails with a message that "a vm having a single network interface cannot be updated to have multiple NICs), as expected for past behavior, but this will work soon, correct? @@@


|**Tool**|**Command**|

### <vm-detach-nic></a>Detach a NIC from an existing virtual machine

The VM you want to detach a NIC from must be in the stopped (deallocated) state. You can detach any NIC, even the primary NIC. Azure automatically assigns a remaining NIC as primary. @@@ How is Azure deciding which one of the remaining NICs to designate as Primary? This operation succeeds currently, even when removing a NIC from a VM that only has two. This is expected future behavior, even though it's currently working for me, correct? @@@
