## What can I find in the Gallery?

The Cortana Intelligence Gallery contains a variety of resources that you can use to develop your own analytics solutions.

- **[Experiments](machine-learning-gallery-experiments.md)** - The Gallery contains a wide variety of experiments that have been developed in Azure Machine Learning Studio. These range from quick proof-of-concept experiments that demonstrate a specific machine learning technique, to fully-developed solutions for complex machine learning problems.

- **[Jupyter Notebooks](machine-learning-gallery-jupyter-notebooks.md)** - Jupyter Notebooks include code, data visualizations, and documentation in a single, interactive canvas. 
Notebooks in the Gallery provide tutorials and detailed explanations of advanced machine learning techniques and solutions.

- **[Machine Learning APIs](https://machine-learning-gallery-apis.md)** - A solution developed in Azure Machine Learning can be launched as a web service so that the analytics model can be accessed by others through a set of REST APIs. A variety of these solutions are available in the Gallery, such as a product recommendation engine or cloud-based face and speech recognition.

-  **[Solution Templates](machine-learning-gallery-solution-templates.md)** - A Solution Template provides a starting point to quickly build a complete end-to-end solution for an industry-specific problem. These templates include extensive documentation and all the tools you need to get you going on your own solution.

- **[Tutorials](machine-learning-gallery-tutorials.md)** - A number of tutorials are available to walk you through machine learning technologies and concepts, or to describe advanced methods for solving various machine learning problems.

These basic Gallery resources can be grouped together logically in a couple different ways:

- **[Collections](machine-learning-gallery-collections.md)** - A collection allows you to group together experiments, APIs, and other Gallery items that address a specific solution or concept.

- **[Industry-specific Solutions](machine-learning-gallery-industry-solutions.md)** - The Industries section of the Gallery brings together various resources that are specific to such industries as retail, manufacturing, banking, and healthcare.

Finally, **[Competitions](machine-learning-gallery-competitions.md)** provide an exciting opportunity to compete with the community of data scientsts to solve complex problems using Cortana Intelligence Suite.
  
## How can I use the Gallery?

Anyone can browse and search the solutions in the Gallery and learn from others.
If you log in using your Microsoft account, you can also download experiments to your own Machine Learning Studio workspace, and you can contribute your own solutions to the Gallery.

### Discover and learn

Search and browse the different types of solutions that have been contributed by Microsoft and the advanced analytics community. Use these to get a head start on solving your own data analysis problems.

You can easily find recently published and popular solutions in the Gallery, or you can search by name, tags, algorithms, and other attributes.
View contributions from a particular author by clicking the author name from within any of the tiles.

Click **Browse all** in the Gallery header, and then select search refinements on the left of the page and enter search terms at the top.

You can comment, provide feedback, or ask questions through the comments section on each solution page.
You can even share a solution of interest with friends or colleagues using the share capabilities of LinkedIn or Twitter.
You may also email links to these solutions to invite other users to view the pages.

### Contribute

When you sign in you become a member of the Gallery community. This allows you to contribute your own experiments and collections so that others can benefit from the solutions you've discovered.

See the section below, [Suggestions for publishing and for quality documentation](#suggestions-for-publishing-and-for-quality-documentation), for more details and tips on how to create a quality gallery contribution.


#### Contribute collections

A *collection* is a list of related items from Cortana Intelligence Gallery that are grouped together for later reference, use, or sharing.
Your collection can contain items that you own or items that have been contributed by the community.

For example, you can use a collection to group together items on a specific topic, or you can group together a multi-step experiment that solves a complex problem.
The initial collections contributed by Microsoft consist of multi-step machine learning experiment templates for solving real world problems, such as online fraud detection, text classification, retail forecasting, and predictive maintenance.

Follow these steps to create and contribute a collection to the Cortana Intelligence Gallery:

- Sign in to the Gallery using your Microsoft account
- Click your image at the top of the window and click your name
- Click **New Collection**
- Give the collection a name, a brief summary, a description, and any tags that will help users find the collection
- Add an image to identify the collection
- Click **Create**

Your collection is now part of the Cortana Intelligence Gallery.

You can add items to your collection by opening the collection, clicking **Edit**, and then clicking **Add Item**. Or, if you find an item while browsing through the Gallery that you want to include, just open the item, click **Add to collection**, and specify the collection you want to add it to.

You can change the summary, description, or tags of your collection by opening the collection and clicking **Edit**.
While you're editing your collection, you can also change the order of the items in the collection by using the arrow buttons next to an item to move it in the list. And you add notes to the items in your collection by clicking the upper-right corner of an item and selecting **Add/Edit note**.

## Suggestions for publishing and for quality documentation

- While you can assume that the reader has prior data science experience, it still helps to simplify your language and explain things in detail wherever possible.
- Not all readers will be familiar with the Cortana Intelligence Suite, given that it is relatively new; therefore, provide enough information and step-by-step explanations to help such readers navigate through your work.
- Visuals including experiment graphs or screenshots of data can be very helpful for readers to interpret and use your content the right way. See [this collection](https://gallery.cortanaintelligence.com/Collection/Publishing-Guidelines-and-Examples-1) for more information on how to include images in your documentation.
- If your dataset is part of your experiment and not being imported through a reader module, it is part of your experiment and will get published to the Gallery. Therefore, ensure that the dataset youâ€™re publishing has appropriate licensing terms for sharing and downloading by anyone. Gallery contributions are covered under the Azure [Terms of Use](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/website-terms-of-use/).
