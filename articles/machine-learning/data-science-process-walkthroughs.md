# Team Data Science Process walkthroughs

The end-to-end walkthroughs itemized here each demonstrate the steps in the Team Data Science Process for **specific scenarios** and illustrate how to combine cloud and on-premise tools and services into a workflow or pipeline to create an intelligent application.

## Using SQL Server
In [The Team Data Science Process in action: using SQL Server](machine-learning-data-science-process-sql-walkthrough.md)  walkthrough shows you how to build and deploy a machine learning model using SQL Server and a publicly available dataset, the [NYC Taxi Trips](http://www.andresmh.com/nyctaxitrips/) dataset


## Using HDInsight Hadoop clusters
In [The Team Data Science Process in action: using HDInsight Hadoop clusters](machine-learning-data-science-process-hive-walkthrough.md) walkthrough, we use an [Azure HDInsight Hadoop cluster](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/hdinsight/) to store, explore and feature engineer data from a publicly available [NYC Taxi Trips](http://www.andresmh.com/nyctaxitrips/) dataset. 


## The Team Data Science Process in action - Using Azure HDInsight Hadoop Clusters on a 1 TB dataset
In [The Team Data Science Process in action - Using Azure HDInsight Hadoop Clusters on a 1 TB dataset](machine-learning-data-science-process-hive-criteo-walkthrough.md) walkthrough, we present an end-to-end scenario that uses an [Azure HDInsight Hadoop cluster](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/hdinsight/) to store, explore, feature engineer, and down sample data from one of the publicly available [Criteo](http://labs.criteo.com/downloads/download-terabyte-click-logs/) datasets.

## Data Science using Spark on Azure HDInsight
In the [Data Science using Spark on Azure HDInsight](machine-learning-data-science-spark-overview.md) walkthrough, we use the Team Data Science Process in an end-to-end scenario using an [Azure HDInsight Spark cluster](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/hdinsight/) to store, explore and feature engineer data from the publicly available [NYC Taxi Trips](http://www.andresmh.com/nyctaxitrips/) dataset. 


## Scalable Data Science in Azure Data Lake
The [Scalable Data Science in Azure Data Lake: An end-to-end Walkthrough](machine-learning-data-science-process-data-lake-walkthrough.md) shows how to use Azure Data Lake to do data exploration and binary classification tasks on a sample of the NYC taxi trip and fare dataset to predict whether or not a tip will be paid by a fare.
