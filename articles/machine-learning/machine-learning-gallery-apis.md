# Discover machine learning APIs in the Cortana Intelligence Gallery

[AZURE.INCLUDE [machine-learning-gallery-item-selector](../../includes/machine-learning-gallery-item-selector.md)]

## Machine Learning APIs

A solution developed in Azure Machine Learning can be launched as a web service so that the analytics model can be accessed by others through a set of REST APIs. A variety of these 
**[Machine Learning APIs](https://gallery.cortanaintelligence.com/machineLearningAPIs)** 
are available in the Gallery, such as a product recommendation engine and cloud-based face and speech recognition.

 The 
**[Machine Learning APIs](https://gallery.cortanaintelligence.com/machineLearningAPIs)**
