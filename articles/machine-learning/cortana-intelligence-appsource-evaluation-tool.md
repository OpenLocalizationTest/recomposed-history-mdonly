# Evaluate a Cortana Intelligence app for AppSource
## Overview
The Cortana Intelligence evaluation tool can be used to assess your advanced analytics applications for compliance with Microsoft-recommended best practices. Microsoft is excited to work with our partners (ISVs / SIs) to provide high-quality solutions for customers, resellers and implementation partners to discover and try business solutions and make the most of their investments. This guide will walk through the process of using the Cortana Intelligence solution evaluation tool with your application and describe the specific best practices in checks for.
## Getting started
Please [download](https://aka.ms/cis-certification-tool-download) and install the Cortana Intelligence Certification Tool:
Pre-requisites:
- Windows 10
- Azure Powershell:
 [download](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/azure/install-azurerm-ps?view=azurermps-4.0.0) and install
## Identifying your app
After installation completes, open the tool and begin your first certification.

![Open evaluation tool](./media/cortana-intelligence-appsource-evaluation-tool/1-open-evaluation-tool.png)

Provide identifying information about your application.

![Connet Azure subscription](./media/cortana-intelligence-appsource-evaluation-tool/2-connect-azure-subscription.png)

Connect to your Azure subscription and provide the Resource Group
containing your app.

![Select resources](./media/cortana-intelligence-appsource-evaluation-tool/3-select-resources.png)

Once the resource group has been loaded, please select the resources that are included in your app and identify the accessibility of any data resources as either:
- Ingestion
- Consumption
- Internal
We use this information to better understand how your app is utilizing various components and to ensure user-facing components are consistent with best practices.
### Ingestion
Ingestion in this case means any data sources that are used to either pull in data from outside the app or that any services outside the app use to push data into the app.
#### Consumption
Publishing in this case means any datasets that are used to push data to end users, either directly or indirectly. For example:
- Datasets used in direct query from PowerBI
- Datasets queried in a WebApp

>[!NOTE]
If a specific resource is used for both ingestion and consumption, please choose “Consumption.”

#### Internal
Use internal for any data resources that are used only in internal application processing.
Next, you will be prompted to provide valid credentials for any databases specified in the prior step:

# Certification test cases
The certification tool will perform a collection of automated tests on your application. For more information see Cortana Intelligence Certification Requirements.

![Set test execution](./media/cortana-intelligence-appsource-evaluation-tool/5-set-test-execution.png)

After the tests complete, you will be asked to provide an explanation or justification for why your app does not comply with the requirement.

![Provide business justification](./media/cortana-intelligence-appsource-evaluation-tool/6-provide-business-justification.png)

For example, if your app publishes to Azure SQL DW, the certification tests require you to also publish to Azure Analysis Services. Your app may use IaaS virtual machines running Sql Server Analysis Services instead of Azure Analysis Services. This would be an acceptable reason for failure of the test.
## Packaging your certification results
After completing the test cases, your certification package will be exported to a zip file and you will be asked to provide feedback on the certification tool.

## Cortana Intelligence Evaluation Requirements
### Overview
There are four groups of evaluation requirements:
- Security
- Scalability
- Availability
- Other

## Security
### Databases should use Azure Active Directory authentication
Any Azure SQL or Azure SQL DW resources in the app should be enabled with Azure Active Directory(AAD) authentication. AAD provides a single place to manage all of your identities and roles.
For more information on why to use AAD integration with Azure SQL and SQL DW, see here:
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-aad-authentication>
For instructions on how to configure AAD integration with Azure SQL and SQL DW, see here:
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-aad-authentication-configure>
### Azure WebApps should use Azure Active Directory authentication
Any Azure WebApps should use Azure Active Directory for user authentication.
For more information about authentication scenarios for Azure WebApps, see here:
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/app-service-authentication-overview>
For instructions on how to configure your Azure WebApps with AAD, see here:
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service-mobile/app-service-mobile-how-to-configure-active-directory-authentication>
### Datasets accessible to end-users should support role-based access control
While executing the evaluation tool, you will be asked to specify any “Reporting/Publishing” resources. It is assumed that these resources are intended for access by end-users, not developers. These resources should be provide role-based access control (RBAC) in order to ensure that end users are only able to access authorized data.
Specifically, any of the following Azure resources can be configured with RBAC and are considered acceptable:
- Secure HDInsight:
 https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/hdinsight/hdinsight-domain-joined-introduction
- Azure SQL
- Azure Analysis Services
- Azure SQL DW (NOTE: While Azure SQL DW does support RBAC, it is not recommended for direct end-user access)
If you are using a different resource type that supports RBAC, please
specify that in the test case justification.
### Azure Data Lake Store should use at-rest encryption
Azure Data Lake Store(ADLS) supports at-rest encryption by default using ADLS-managed encryption keys. You may also configure encryption using Azure Key Vault.
For information about specifying ADLS encryption settings, see here:
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-lake-store/data-lake-store-get-started-portal#create-an-azure-data-lake-store-account>
### Azure SQL and Azure SQL DW should use encryption
Azure SQL and Azure SQL DW both support Transparent Data Encryption (TDE), which provides real-time encryption and decryption of both data and log files.
For more information on why to use Transparent Data Encryption, see here:
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/encryption/transparent-data-encryption-tde>
For instructions on how to configure Azure SQL DW with TDE, see here:
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-data-warehouse/sql-data-warehouse-encryption-tde-tsql>
For instructions on how to configure Azure SQL with TDE, see here:
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/security/encryption/transparent-data-encryption-with-azure-sql-database>
In addition to TDE, Azure SQL also supports Always Encrypted, a new data encryption technology that ensures data is encrypted not only at-rest and during movement between client and server, but also while data is in use while executing commands on the server.
For instructions on how to configure Azure SQL with Always Encrypted, see here:
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-always-encrypted-azure-key-vault>
### Any Virtual Machines must be deployed from the Azure Marketplace
In order to provide a consistent level of security across AppSource, we require that any virtual machines deployed as part of a Cortana Intelligence app be certified and published on the Azure Marketplace.
To search the current list of Azure Marketplace images, see here:
<https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/category/compute>
For information on how to publish a virtual machine image for Azure Marketplace, see here:
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/marketplace-publishing/marketplace-publishing-vm-image-creation>
## Scalability
### Cortana Intelligence apps should include a scalable big data platform
Cortana Intelligence apps should scale to very large data sizes. In Azure, this means they should include one of the two Petabyte-scale data platforms:
- Azure Data Lake Store
- Azure SQL Data Warehouse
If your app does not require support for these data sizes or if you are using an alternative data platform, please explain this in the test case justification.
### Cortana Intelligence apps should include dedicated “ingestion” data environments
Cortana Intelligence apps should generally avoid directly inserting data into relational data sources. Instead, raw data should be stored in an unstructured environment, with idempotent inserts/updates into any relational stores using Azure Data Factory.
For more information on copying data with Azure Data Factory, see here:
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-factory/data-factory-copy-activity-tutorial-using-visual-studio>
### Azure SQL DW should use Polybase for data ingestion
Azure SQL DW supports Polybase for highly scalable, parallel data ingestion. Polybase allows you to use Azure SQL DW to issue queries against external datasets stored in either Azure Blob Storage or Azure Data Lake Store. This provides superior performance to alternative methods of bulk insters/updates.
For instructions on getting started with Polybase and Azure SQL DW, see here:
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-data-warehouse/sql-data-warehouse-get-started-load-with-polybase>
For more information about best practices with Polybase and Azure SQL DW, see here:
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-data-warehouse/sql-data-warehouse-load-polybase-guide>
## Availability
### Datasets accessible to end users should support a large volume of concurrent users
While executing the evaluation tool, you will be asked to specify any “Reporting/Publishing” resources. It is assumed that these resources are intended for access by end-users, not developers. These resources should support medium-large numbers of concurrent users.
Specifically, Azure SQL Data Warehouse should NOT be the sole data source available to end users. If Azure SQL DW is provided as a resource for Power Users, Azure Analysis Services should be made available to typical users.
For more information about Azure SQL DW concurrency limits, see here:
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-data-warehouse/sql-data-warehouse-develop-concurrency>
For more information about Azure Analysis Services, see here:
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/analysis-services/analysis-services-overview>
### Azure SQL resources should have a read-only replica for failover
Azure SQL databases support geo-replication to a secondary instance. This instance can then be used as a failover instance to provide high availability applications.
For more information about geo-replication for Azure SQL databases, see here:
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-geo-replication-overview>
For instructions on how to configure geo-replication for Azure SQL, see here:
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-database/sql-database-geo-replication-transact-sql>
### Azure SQL DW should have geo-redundant backups enabled
Azure SQL DW supports daily backups to geo-redundant storage. This geo-replication ensures you can restore the data warehouse even in situations where you cannot access snapshots stored in your primary region. This feature is on by default and should not be disable for Cortana Intelligence apps.
For more information about Azure SQL DW backups and restoration, see here:
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/sql-data-warehouse/sql-data-warehouse-backups>
### Virtual machines should be configured with availability sets
Azure virtual machines should be configured in availability sets in order to minimize the impact of planned and unplanned maintenance events.
For more information about Azure virtual machine availability, see here:
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/windows/manage-availability>
## Other
### Cortana Intelligence apps should use a centralized tool for data orchestration
Using a single tool for managing and scheduling data movement and transformation ensures consistency around mission-critical data. It provides a clear logic around retry logic, dependency management, alert/logging, etc. We recommend the use of Azure Data Factory for data orchestration in Azure. Read more about Azure Data Factory here: <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-factory/data-factory-introduction>
If you are using a tool other than Azure Data Factory for data orchestration, please describe which tool or tools you are using.
### Azure Machine Learning models should be retrained using Azure Data Factory
Azure Machine Learning(AzureML) provides easy to use tools for the creation and deployment of predictive modeling and machine learning pipelines. However, it is important that production deployments of these AzureML models is not based on a single fixed dataset, but instead adapts to the shifting dynamics of real-world phenomena.
For more information on creating retraining web services in AzureML, see here:
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/machine-learning-retrain-models-programmatically>
For more information about automating the model training process using Azure Data Factory, see here:
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-factory/data-factory-azure-ml-update-resource-activity>
