# Infographic: Machine learning basics with algorithm examples

Use this easy-to-understand, downloadable infographic overview of machine learning basics to identify the popular algorithms used to answer common machine learning questions. Algorithm examples help the machine learning beginner understand which algorithms to use and what they are used for.

## Popular algorithms are available in Machine Learning Studio
[Azure Machine Learning Studio](https://studio.azureml.net/) comes with a large number of machine learning algorithms that you can use to solve predictive analytics problems.

The downloadable infographic below demonstrates how the four types of machine learning algorithms - **regression**, **anomaly detection**, **clustering**, and **classification** - can be used to answer your machine learning questions.
