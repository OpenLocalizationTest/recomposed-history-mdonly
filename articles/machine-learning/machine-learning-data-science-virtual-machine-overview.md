# Introduction to the Data Science Virtual Machine for Linux and Windows, a cloud environment and toolkit

The Data Science Virtual Machine is a data science environment and toolkit provisioned in the cloud on Microsoft Azure and ready for analytics. It has many popular data science and other tools pre-installed and pre-configured to jump-start building intelligent applications using advanced analytics. These tools can be deployed on the cloud, on-premises or in a hybrid environment. It also includes tools that make it easy to work with various Azure Data and analytics products. You can explore and build predictive models on large-scale data sets using the Microsoft R Server (Developer Edition) on the VM. A host of other tools from the Open source community and from Microsoft are also included. The DSVM is available on both Windows Server 2012 and Linux (OpenLogic CentOS 7 based). 

The goal of the DSVM is to provide data professionals at all skill levels and roles with a friction-free data science environment. This VM saves you considerable time that you would spend if you rolled out a comparable environment on your own. The DSVM is pre-configured for the broad usage scenarios:

- Scale your environment up or down as your project needs change.
- Use any language to program your data science tasks.
- Install other tools and customize the system for your exact needs.​​

The Microsoft Data Science Virtual Machine (DSVM) is available on Windows 2012 Server or OpenLogic 7.2 CentOS-based Linux operating systems. It contains popular tools for data science modeling and development activities and machine learning tools. All the tools are preinstalled and preconfigured to help you get started immediately after you create your instance of the virtual machine on Azure.

This topic discusses some of the **key scenarios** for using the DSVM, itemizes the **key features** available on the Windows and Linux versions, and outlines **how to get started** using them.


##Key usage scenarios

### Analytics Desktop on Cloud

The DSVM provides a baseline configuration for data science teams looking to replace their local desktops with a managed cloud desktop. This baseline ensures that all the data scientists on a team have a consistent setup with which to verify experiments and promote collaboration. It also lowers costs by reducing the sysadmin burden and saving on the time needed to evaluate, install, and maintain the various software packages needed to do advanced analytics.  

### Data Science Training and Education

Enterprise trainers and educators that teach data science classes usually provide a virtual machine image to ensure that their students have a consistent setup and that the samples work predictably. The DSVM creates an on-demand environment with a consistent setup that eases the support and incompatibility challenges. Cases where these environments need to be built frequently, especially for shorter training classes, benefit substantially.

### On-demand elastic capacity for large workloads

Data science hackathons/competitions or large-scale data modeling and exploration require scaled out hardware capacity, typically for short duration. The DSVM can help replicate the data science environment quickly on demand, on scaled out servers that allow experiments requiring high-powered computing resources to be run.

### Short-term experimentation and evaluation

The DSVM can be used to evaluate or learn tools such as Microsoft R Server, SQL Server, Visual Studio tools, Jupyter, deep learning / ML toolkits, and new tools popular in the community with minimal setup effort. Since the DSVM can be set up quickly, it can be applied in other short-term usage scenarios such as replicating published experiments, executing demos, following walkthroughs in online sessions or conference tutorials.


## Key features in Windows and Linux versions

## How to get started with the Data Science Virtual Machine

### Get started with the Windows version of the DSVM

- Create an instance of the VM on Windows by navigating to [this page](https://azure.microsoft.com/marketplace/partners/microsoft-ads/standard-data-science-vm/) and selecting the green **Create Virtual Machine** button.
- Sign in to the VM from your remote desktop using the credentials you specified when you created the VM.
- To discover and launch the tools available, click the **Start** menu.


### Get started with the Linux version of the DSVM

- Create an instance of the VM on Linux (OpenLogic CentOS-based) by navigating to [this page](https://azure.microsoft.com/marketplace/partners/microsoft-ads/linux-data-science-vm/) and selecting the **Create Virtual Machine** button.
- Sign in to the VM from an SSH client, such as Putty or SSH Command, using the credentials you specified when you created the VM.
- In the shell prompt, enter dsvm-more-info.
- For a graphical desktop, download the X2Go client for your client platform [here](http://wiki.x2go.org/doku.php/doc:installation:x2goclient) and follow the instructions in the Linux DSVM document [Provision the Linux Data Science Virtual Machine](machine-learning-data-science-linux-dsvm-intro.md#installing-and-configuring-x2go-client).
