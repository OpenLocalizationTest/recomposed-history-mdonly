# Infographic of basic machine learning algorithm examples 

What are machine learning basics?
What machine learning questions can you answer using the most popular algorithms in Azure Machine Learning?
What are examples of machine learning algorithms?

[Azure Machine Learning Studio](https://studio.azureml.net/) comes with a large number of machine learning algorithms that you can use to solve predictive analytics problems. 
The infographic below demonstrates how the four types of machine learning algorithms - **regression**, **anomaly detection**, **clustering**, and **classification** - can be used to answer your machine learning questions.

> [AZURE.NOTE] You can download this infographic as a PDF file. The PDF file contains embedded links to examples of each algorithm.
