# Excel Add-in for Azure Machine Learning web services

Excel makes it easy to call web services directly without the need to write any code.

## Steps to Use an Existing Web Service

1. Open the sample Excel file here or from the web services **DASHBOARD** tab.
2. Choose a web service by clicking it - "Titanic Survivor Predictor (Excel Add-in Sample) [Score]" in this example.

    ![Select web service][01]

3. This will take you to the **Predict** section.  Select a cell in Excel and click **Use sample data**. Optionally edit the data in Excel.

## Steps to Add a New Web Service

1. Publish a web service ([this page](machine-learning-walkthrough-5-publish-web-service.md) explains how to do it) or find an existing web service.
2. Once you have a web service, click the **WEB SERVICES** section in the left pane of Machine Learning Studio, and then select the web service to consume.
3. From the **DASHBOARD** tab for the web service, copy the API key for the web service.
4. In Excel, go to the **Web Services** section (if you are in the **Predict** section, click the back arrow to go to the list of web services).

10.	To use the web service, follow the directions above, "Steps to Use an Existing Web Service".

## Sharing Your Workbook

If you save your workbook, then the API keys for the web services you have added will also be saved.  That means you should only share the workbook with individuals you trust.
