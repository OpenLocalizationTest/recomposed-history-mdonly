# DataMarket is now deprecated

The [Microsoft DataMarket](https://datamarket.azure.com/datasets) is now deprecated. As such, the Machine Learning APIs
that were hosted there are also deprecated.

## Text analytics API

Previous DataMarket Text Analytics API customers should start using the Cognitive Services Text Analytics API.
The [Cognitive Services Text Analytics API](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/text-analytics-api)
supports all the scenarios that the earlier DataMarket version did, as well as additional scenarios such as
language detection and topic detection.


## Recommendations API 

Previous DataMarket Recommendations API customers should start using the Cognitive Services Recommendations API.
The [Cognitive Services Recommendations API](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/recommendations-api)
supports all the scenarios that the earlier DataMarket version did, as well as additional scenarios, such as 
batch support and better offline metrics to evaluate the quality of models. 

For more information about how to start using the new API, please visit the [Migrate to Azure Cognitive Services
Recommendations API]((http://aka.ms/recomigrate)) page.
