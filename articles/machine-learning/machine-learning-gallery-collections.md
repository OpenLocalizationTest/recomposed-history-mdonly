# Discover and share collections in the Cortana Intelligence Gallery
[!INCLUDE [machine-learning-gallery-item-selector](../../includes/machine-learning-gallery-item-selector.md)]

## Collections
You can use a **[collection](https://gallery.cortanaintelligence.com/collections)** to group experiments, APIs, and other Gallery items that you use for a specific solution or concept. You can group them for later reference or to share.

## Discover
To browse collections [in the Gallery](http://gallery.cortanaintelligence.com), under **More**, select **Collections**.

![Select Collections from the Gallery home page](media/machine-learning-gallery-collections/select-collections-in-gallery.png)

 The **[Collections](https://gallery.cortanaintelligence.com/collections)**  page displays a list of the most recently added and most popular collections.  Select the **See all** button to view all collections. To search for a specific collection, you can select filter criteria or enter search terms.

To read more information about a collection, you can click any collection to open the collection's details page. On a collection's details page, under **Comments**, you can comment, provide feedback, or ask questions. You can even share the collection with friends or colleagues on LinkedIn or Twitter. You also can email a link to the experiment, to invite other users to view the page.

## Contribute
You can create a collection that contains items that you own or items that have been contributed by the community. An item in a collection can be any Gallery item that addresses a specific solution or concept.

For example, you can use a collection to group items on a specific topic, or you can group a multi-step experiment that solves a complex problem. The initial collections contributed by Microsoft consist of multi-step machine learning experiment templates. The templates can be used for solving real-world problems, such as online fraud detection, text classification, retail forecasting, or predictive maintenance.

### Create a collection
To create and contribute a collection to the Cortana Intelligence Gallery, complete these steps:

1. Sign in to the Gallery by using your Microsoft account.

2.  Select your image at the top of the window, and then select your name.

5. Select **Next**. You can select an image that will be displayed with the collection. You can upload your own image file, or select a stock image. Choose an image that might help users identify the content and purpose of the collection.
