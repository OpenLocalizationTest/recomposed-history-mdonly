# Azure App Service and its impact on existing Azure services

This article outlines the changes to existing Azure
services as part of the move to consolidate several existing as well as new Azure services
under the App Service brand. It explains the change and impact of the new branding.

## Overview 

Azure App Service is a one-of-a-kind cloud service that enables you to create enterprise grade web and mobile apps for any platform or device, fast. App Service is an integrated solution designed to streamline repeated coding functions, integrate with enterprise and SaaS systems, and automate business processes while meeting your companyâ€™s requirements for security, reliability, and scalability. App Service provides an integrated cloud app platform that spans the diverse needs of modern
enterprise apps across both client and mobile devices. Azure App Service includes the following pieces:

-   Web Apps
-   Mobile Apps
-   API Apps
-   Logic Apps
-   BizTalk Connectors

Azure already offers Websites and Mobile Services. The following tables
explain how App Service impacts these existing services and adds new features.
