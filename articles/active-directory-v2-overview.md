# Preview: Signing In Microsoft Account & Azure AD users with a single auth endpoint
In the past, an app developer who wanted to support both Microsoft Accounts and Azure Active Directory was required to integrate with two completely separate systems.  Now you can sign users in with both types of accounts using OpenID Connect or OAuth 2.0 and the  "v2.0" authentication endpoint:

```
https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/authorize
https://login.microsoftonline.com/common/oauth2/v2.0/token
```

 One simple process allows you to immediately reach an audience that spans millions of users with both personal and work/school accounts.

| Register an app at <br> [apps.dev.microsoft.com](apps.dev.microsoft.com) | Learn the auth protocols, <br> [OAuth 2.0]() & [OpenID Connect]() | [Get Started]() with tutorials <br> using our open source auth libraries |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------------ |

Your apps can also consume a [unified set of Microsoft REST APIs]() using either type of account, including:

- Files through OneDrive and OneDrive for Business
- Mail, Contacts, and Calendars through Outlook.com and Office 365
- Users, Groups, and Company Information through Azure Active Directory

With more Microsoft Online services to be added in the near future. Several apps have already begun to bridge the gap between consumer and enterprise accounts, including: [Boomerang](), [TripIt](), & [Uber]().

> [AZURE.NOTE]
	This information applies to the v2.0 endpoint public preview.  For instructions on how to integrate with the generally available Azure AD service, please refer to the [Azure Active Directory Developer Guide](active-directory-developers-guide.md).

## Getting Started
To get your own app up & running with the v2.0 endpoint, try out one of our quick start tutorials below.
