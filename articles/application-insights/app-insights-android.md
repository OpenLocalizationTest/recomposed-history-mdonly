# Analytics for Android apps

[HockeyApp](http://hockeyapp.net/) is our Mobile DevOps solution for iOS, OS X, Android or Windows device apps, as well as cross platform apps based on Xamarin, Cordova, and Unity. With it, you can distribute builds to beta testers, collect crash data, and get user feedback. Itâ€™s integrated with Visual Studio Team Services enabling easy build deployments and work item integration. You can learn more from the [HockeyApp Knowledge Base](http://support.hockeyapp.net/kb) and keep up to date on the [HockeyApp Blog](http://hockeyapp.net/blog/).

Use [Visual Studio Application Insights](app-insights-overview.md) to monitor the web server side of your app on [ASP.NET](app-insights-asp-net.md) or [J2EE](app-insights-java-get-started.md).

There's also an [Application Insights SDK for Android](https://github.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Android) which sends telemetry to the Application Insights portal.
