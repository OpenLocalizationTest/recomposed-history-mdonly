# Share results with your team using Workbooks that combine live data and text in Application Insights

TBD

TBD - have a link to [Azure Application Insights](app-insights-overview.md).

## Get started

TBD

TBD - link to [learn how to get started with the usage tools](app-insights-usage-overview.md).

TBD - provided you have [instrumented it](app-insights-javascript.md). 

    A custom event represents one occurrence of something happening in your app, often a user interaction like a button click or the completion of some task. You insert code in your app to [generate custom events](app-insights-api-custom-events-metrics.md#trackevent).

## TBD

TBD.
