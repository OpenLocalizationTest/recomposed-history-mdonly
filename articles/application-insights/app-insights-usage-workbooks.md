# Share results with your team using Workbooks that combine live data and text in Application Insights

Workbooks combine [Azure Application Insights](app-insights-overview.md) data visualizations, [Analytics queries](app-insights-analytics.md), and text into interactive documents. Workbooks are editable by other team members with access to the same Azure resource. This means the queries and controls used to create a workbook are available to other people reading the workbook, making them easy to explore, extend, and check for mistakes.

Workbooks are helpful tools for:

* Exploring the usage of your app when you don't know the metrics of interest in advance: numbers of users, retention rates, converstion rates, etc.
* Explaining to your team how a newly released feature is performing, by showing user counts for key interactions and other metrics
* Sharing the results of an A/B experiment in your app with other members of your team by explaining the goals for the experiment with text, then showing each usage metric and Analytics query used to evaluate the experiment, along with clear call-outs for whether each metric was above- or below-target.
* TBD outage

## Getting Started

TBD

TBD - link to [learn how to get started with the usage tools](app-insights-usage-overview.md).

TBD - provided you have [instrumented it](app-insights-javascript.md). 

    A custom event represents one occurrence of something happening in your app, often a user interaction like a button click or the completion of some task. You insert code in your app to [generate custom events](app-insights-api-custom-events-metrics.md#trackevent).
