# CodeLens in Visual Studio

CodeLens provides quick, useful information in the context of your code, like the number of places a function is referenced or the last person who edited a function. With Application Insights, exception and request information from your app is available right from CodeLens.

![CodeLens](./media/app-insights-visual-studio-codelens/codelens-overview.png)

> [AZURE.NOTE] Application Insights in CodeLens is available in Visual Studio 2015 Update 3 and later, or with the [Developer Analytics Tools extension](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/82367b81-3f97-4de1-bbf1-eaf52ddc635a) version TBD and later. CodeLens is only available in the Enterprise and Professional editions of Visual Studio. CodeLens is not available in Visual Studio Community.

## Using CodeLens

CodeLens indicators are shown above class, method, and other declarations in C# and Visual Basic code. If Application Insights data is available for a method, you'll see indicators for requests and exceptions like "100 requests, 1% failed" or "10 exceptions." Click a CodeLens indicator for more details.

> [AZURE.TIP] Application Insights request and exception information may take a few extra seconds to load after other CodeLens indicators appear.
