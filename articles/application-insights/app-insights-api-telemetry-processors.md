# Processing telemetry in the Application Insights SDK

*Application Insights is in preview.*

You can write and configure plug-ins for the Application Insights SDK to customize how telemetry is captured and processed before it is sent to the Application Insights service. 

* [Sampling](#sampling) reduces the volume of telemetry without skewing statistics. It keeps together related data points to make searching easy.
* [Telemetry processors](#telemetry-processors) initialize, filter and sample data in the SDK before it is sent to the server. For example, you could add calculated properties to some telemetry, or reduce the volume of telemetry by excluding requests from robots. 
* [Telemetry initializers](#telemetry-initializers) add  default properties to all the telemetry that is sent, and can override some behavior of the standard telemetry modules. The properties are evaluated for each tracking call, so you can vary these values.
* [Context initializers](#context-initializers) also set global properties. The properties are set once, at startup time, and can't be changed later. Although this saves some CPU time (by contrast with telemetry initializers) they're also very inflexible.
* [The SDK API](app-insights-api-custom-events-metrics.md) is used to send custom events and metrics.

There's some redundancy between these different mechanisms, and it's likely that the initializers will change in the future.

Before you start:

* Install the [Application Insights SDK](app-insights-asp-net.md) in your app. Telemetry Processors need the 
* Try the [Application Insights API](app-insights-api-custom-events-metrics.md). 


## Sampling

*This feature is in beta.*

The recommended way to reduce traffic while preserving accurate statistics. The filter selects items that are related so that you can navigate between items in diagnosis. Event counts are adjusted in metric explorer to compensate for the filtered items.

For ASP.NET servers, insert this in a suitable initialization location such as Application_Start:

*C#*

```C#

    using Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.WindowsServer.TelemetryChannel;
    // This configures sampling percentage at 10%:
    TelemetryConfiguration.Active.TelemetryChannel = new TelemetryChannelBuilder().UseSampling(10.0).Build();

```

For web pages, put an extra line in the [Application Insights snippet](app-insights-javascript.md) that you inserted (typically in a master page such as _Layout.cshtml):

*JavaScript*

```JavaScript

	}({ 

	samplingPercentage: 10.0, 

	instrumentationKey:...
	}); 
```

* Set a percentage (10 in these examples) that is equal to 100/N where N is an integer - for example 50 (=1/2), 33.33 (=1/3), 25 (=1/4), 10 (=1/5).
* If you set sampling in both client and server side, make sure to set the same sampling percentage in both sides.
* Client and server sides will coordinate to select related items.

[Learn more about sampling](app-insights-sampling.md).

## Telemetry Processors

Write telemetry processors to filter and preprocess telemetry generated by the Application Insights SDK before it is sent to the backend portal. This includes telemetry from the standard modules such as the HTTP request collector and the dependency collector. You can, for example, filter out telemetry about requests from robots, or successful dependency calls. 

> [AZURE.WARNING] Filtering the telemetry sent from the SDK using processors can skew the statistics that you see in the portal, and make it difficult to follow related items.
> 
> Instead, consider using [sampling](app-insights-sampling.md).

### Create a telemetry processor

1. To create a filter, implement ITelemetryProcessor. This is another extensibility point like telemetry module, telemetry initializer and telemetry channel. 

    Notice that Telemetry Processors construct a chain of processing. When you instantiate a telemetry processor, you pass a link to the next processor in the chain. When a telemetry data point is passed to the Process method, it does its work and then calls the next Telemetry Processor in the chain.

    ``` C#

    namespace FilteringTelemetryProcessor
    {
      using Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Channel;
      using Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.DataContracts;

      class UnauthorizedRequestFilteringProcessor : ITelemetryProcessor
      {
        public UnauthorizedRequestFilteringProcessor(ITelemetryProcessor next)
		//Initialization will fail without this constructor. Link processors to each other
        {
            this.Next = next;
        }
        public void Process(ITelemetry item)
        {
            // To filter out an item, just return 
            if (!OKtoSend(item)) { return; }
            // Modify the item if required 
            ModifyItem(item);

            this.Next.Process(item);
        }      private ITelemetryProcessor Next { get; set; }
      }
    }

    ```
2. In a suitable initialization class - for example AppStart in Global.asax.cs - insert your processor into the chain:

    ```C#

    var builder = new TelemetryChannelBuilder();
    builder.Use((next) => new UnauthorizedRequestFilteringProcessor(next));

    // If you have more processors:
    builder.Use((next) => new AnotherProcessor(next));

    TelemetryConfiguration.Active.TelemetryChannel = builder.Build();

    ```

    TelemetryClients created after this point will use your processors.

### Example filters

#### Synthetic requests

Filter out bots and web tests. Although Metrics Explorer gives you the option to filter out synthetic sources, this option reduces traffic by filtering them at the SDK.

``` C#

public void Process(ITelemetry item)
{
    if (!string.IsNullOrEmpty(item.Context.Operation.SyntheticSource))
    { return; }

    this.Next.Process(item);
}

```

#### Failed authentication

Filter out requests with a "401" responses. 

```C#

public void Process(ITelemetry item)
{
    var request = item as RequestTelemetry;

    if (request != null &&
    request.ResponseCode.Equals("401", StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))
    {
        // To filter out an item, just terminate the chain: 
        return;
    }
    // Send everything else: 
    this.Next.Process(item);
}

```

#### Filter out fast remote dependency calls

If you only want to diagnose calls that are slow, filter out the fast ones. 

> [AZURE.NOTE] This will skew the statistics you see on the portal. The dependency chart will look as if the dependency calls are all failures.

``` C#

public void Process(ITelemetry item)
{
    var request = item as DependencyTelemetry;
            
    if (request != null && request.Duration.Milliseconds < 100)
    {
        return;
    }
    this.Next.Process(item);
}

```


## Telemetry Initializers

Use telemetry initializers to define global properties that are sent with all telemetry; and to override selected behavior of the standard telemetry modules. 

For example, the Application Insights for Web package collects telemetry about HTTP requests. By default, it flags as failed any request with a response code >= 400. But if you want to treat 400 as a success, you can provide a telemetry initializer that sets the Success property.

If you provide a telemetry initializer, it is called whenever any of the Track*() methods is called. This includes methods called by the standard telemetry modules. By convention, these modules do not set any property that has already been set by an initializer. 

**Define your initializer**

*C#*

```C#

    using System;
    using Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Channel;
    using Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.DataContracts;
    using Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Extensibility;

    namespace MvcWebRole.Telemetry
    {
      /*
       * Custom TelemetryInitializer that overrides the default SDK 
       * behavior of treating response codes >= 400 as failed requests
       * 
       */
      public class MyTelemetryInitializer : ITelemetryInitializer
      {
        public void Initialize(ITelemetry telemetry)
        {
            var requestTelemetry = telemetry as RequestTelemetry;
            // Is this a TrackRequest() ?
            if (requestTelemetry == null) return;
            int code;
            bool parsed = Int32.TryParse(requestTelemetry.ResponseCode, out code);
            if (!parsed) return;
            if (code >= 400 && code < 500)
            {
                // If we set the Success property, the SDK won't change it:
                requestTelemetry.Success = true;
                // Allow us to filter these requests in the portal:
                requestTelemetry.Context.Properties["Overridden400s"] = "true";
            }
            // else leave the SDK to set the Success property      
        }
      }
    }
```

**Load your initializer**

In ApplicationInsights.config:

    <ApplicationInsights>
      <TelemetryInitializers>
        <!-- Fully qualified type name, assembly name: -->
        <Add Type="MvcWebRole.Telemetry.MyTelemetryInitializer, MvcWebRole"/> 
        ...
      </TelemetryInitializers>
    </ApplicationInsights>

*Alternatively,* you can instantiate the initializer in code, for example in Global.aspx.cs:


```C#
    protected void Application_Start()
    {
        // ...
        TelemetryConfiguration.Active.TelemetryInitializers
        .Add(new MyTelemetryInitializer());
    }
```


[See more of this sample.](https://github.com/Microsoft/ApplicationInsights-Home/tree/master/Samples/AzureEmailService/MvcWebRole)

<a name="js-initializer"></a>
### JavaScript telemetry initializers

*JavaScript*

Insert a telemetry initializer immediately after the initialization code that you got from the portal: 

```JS

    <script type="text/javascript">
        // ... initialization code
        ...({
            instrumentationKey: "your instrumentation key"
        });
        window.appInsights = appInsights;


        // Adding telemetry initializer.
        // This is called whenever a new telemetry item
        // is created.

        appInsights.queue.push(function () {
            appInsights.context.addTelemetryInitializer(function (envelope) {
                var telemetryItem = envelope.data.baseData;

                // To check the telemetry item’s type - for example PageView:
                if (envelope.name == Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Telemetry.PageView.envelopeType) {
                    // this statement removes url from all page view documents
                    telemetryItem.url = "URL CENSORED";
                }

                // To set custom properties:
                telemetryItem.properties = telemetryItem.properties || {};
                telemetryItem.properties["globalProperty"] = "boo";

                // To set custom metrics:
                telemetryItem.measurements = telemetryItem.measurements || {};
                telemetryItem.measurements["globalMetric"] = 100;
            });
        });

        // End of inserted code.

        appInsights.trackPageView();
    </script>
```

For a summary of the non-custom properties available on the telemetryItem, see the [data model](app-insights-export-data-model.md/#lttelemetrytypegt).

You can add as many initializers as you like. 




## <a name="dynamic-ikey"></a> Dynamic instrumentation key

To avoid mixing up telemetry from development, test and production environments, you can [create separate Application Insights resources][create] and change their keys depending on the environment.

Instead of getting the instrumentation key from the configuration file, you can set it in your code. Set the key in an initialization method, such as global.aspx.cs in an ASP.NET service:

*C#*

    protected void Application_Start()
    {
      Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Extensibility.
        TelemetryConfiguration.Active.InstrumentationKey = 
          // - for example -
          WebConfigurationManager.Settings["ikey"];
      ...

*JavaScript*

    appInsights.config.instrumentationKey = myKey; 



In web pages, you might want to set it from the web server's state, rather than coding it literally into the script. For example, in a web page generated in an ASP.NET app:

*JavaScript in Razor*

    <script type="text/javascript">
    // Standard Application Insights web page script:
    var appInsights = window.appInsights || function(config){ ...
    // Modify this part:
    }({instrumentationKey:  
      // Generate from server property:
      @Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Extensibility.
         TelemetryConfiguration.Active.InstrumentationKey"
    }) // ...


## <a name="default-properties"></a>Context initializers - Set default properties for all telemetry

You can set up a universal initializer so that all new TelemetryClients automatically use your context. This includes standard telemetry sent by the platform-specific telemetry modules, such as web server request tracking.

A typical use is to identify telemetry coming from different versions or components of your app. In the portal, you can filter or group results by the "Application Version" property.

In general, [we recommend that you use telemetry initializers rather than context initializers](http://apmtips.com/blog/2015/06/09/do-not-use-context-initializers/).

#### Define a context initializer


*C#*

```C#

    using System;
    using Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Channel;
    using Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.DataContracts;
    using Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.Extensibility;

    namespace MyNamespace
    {
      // Context initializer class
      public class MyContextInitializer : IContextInitializer
      {
        public void Initialize (TelemetryContext context)
        {
            if (context == null) return;

            context.Component.Version = "v2.1";
        }
      }
    }
```

*Java*

```Java

    import com.microsoft.applicationinsights.extensibility.ContextInitializer;
    import com.microsoft.applicationinsights.telemetry.TelemetryContext;

    public class MyContextInitializer implements ContextInitializer {
      @Override
      public void initialize(TelemetryContext context) {
        context.Component.Version = "2.1";
      }
    }
```

#### Load your context initializer

In ApplicationInsights.config:

    <ApplicationInsights>
      <ContextInitializers>
        <!-- Fully qualified type name, assembly name: -->
        <Add Type="MyNamespace.MyContextInitializer, MyAssemblyName"/> 
        ...
      </ContextInitializers>
    </ApplicationInsights>

*Alternatively,* you can instantiate the initializer in code:

*C#*

```C#

    protected void Application_Start()
    {
        // ...
        TelemetryConfiguration.Active.ContextInitializers
        .Add(new MyContextInitializer());
    }
```

*Java*

```Java

    // load the context initializer
    TelemetryConfiguration.getActive().getContextInitializers().add(new MyContextInitializer());
```




## Limits

There are some limits on the number of metrics and events per application.

1. Up to 500 telemetry data points per second per instrumentation key (that is, per application). This includes both the standard telemetry sent by the SDK modules, and custom events, metrics and other telemetry sent by your code.
1.	Maximum of 200 unique metric names and 200 unique property names for your application. Metrics include data send via TrackMetric as well as measurements on other  data types such as Events.  Metrics and property names are global per instrumentation key, not scoped to data type.
2.	Properties can be used for filtering and group-by only while they have less than 100 unique values for each property. After the unique values exceed 100, the property can still be used for search and filtering but no longer for filters.
3.	Standard properties such as Request Name and Page URL are limited to 1000 unique values per week. After 1000 unique values, additional values are marked as "Other values". The original value can still be used for full text search and filtering.

* *Q: How long is data kept?*

## Questions

* *What exceptions might Track_() calls throw?*
    
    None. You don't need to wrap them in try-catch clauses. If the SDK encounters problems, it will log messages that you will see in the debug console output, and - if the messages get through - in diagnostic search.



* *Is there a REST API?*

    Yes, but we aren't publishing it yet.
