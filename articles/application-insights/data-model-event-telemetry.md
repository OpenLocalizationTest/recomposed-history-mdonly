# Event Telemetry

Events represent a point in time action happened in the application. Typically it will be user interaction like button click, order checkout or application life cycle events like initialization or configuration update. Event name expected to be a short low cardinality string. 

Semantically events may or may now be correlated to requests. However if used properly event telemetry is more important than requests or traces as it represent business telemetry and should be a subject to separate, less aggressive sampling.

### Name

Event name. Keep it low cardinality to allow proper grouping and useful metrics.

Max length: 512 characters
