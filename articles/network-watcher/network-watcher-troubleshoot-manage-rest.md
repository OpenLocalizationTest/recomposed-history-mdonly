# Troubleshoot Virtual Network Gateway and connections using Azure Network Watcher Troubleshoot REST API

Network Watcher troubleshoot API provides the ability to troubleshoot Virtual Network Gateway and connection issues.

This article takes you through the different management tasks that are currently available for packet capture.

- [**Troubleshoot a Virtual Network Gateway**](#troubleshoot-a-virtual-network-gateway)
- [**Troubleshoot a connection**](#troubleshoot-connections)

## Before you begin

To provide the examples **PowerShell** is used with ARMclient, which is found on chocolatey at [ARMClient on Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/packages/ARMClient)

This scenario assumes you have already followed the steps in [Create a Network Watcher](network-watcher-create.md) to create a Network Watcher.

## Overview

The Network Watcher troubleshoot API provides the ability troubleshoot issues that arise with Virtual Network Gateways and connections. When a request is made to the troubleshoot API, logs are querying and inspected. When inspection is complete the results are returned. The troubleshoot API requests are long running requests which could take multiple minutes to return a result. Logs are stored in a container on a storage account.


## Log in with ARMClient

```PowerShell
armclient login
```

## Troubleshoot a Virtual Network Gateway


### POST the troubleshoot request

The following example queries the status of a Virtual Network Gateway.

```powershell

$subscriptionId = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
$resourceGroupName = "ContosoRG"
$NWresourceGroupName = "NetworkWatcherRG"
$networkWatcherName = "NetworkWatcher_westcentralus"
$vnetGatewayName = "ContosoVNETGateway"
$storageAccountName = "contososa"
$containerName = "gwlogs"
$requestBody = @"
{
'TargetResourceId': '/subscriptions/${subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/${resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworkGateways/${vnetGatewayName}',
'Properties': {
'StorageId': '/subscriptions/${subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/${resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/${storageAccountName}',
'StoragePath': 'https://${storageAccountName}.blob.core.windows.net/${containerName}'
}
}
"@

}
armclient post "https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/${subscriptionId}/ResourceGroups/${NWresourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Network/networkWatchers/${networkWatcherName}/troubleshoot?api-version=2016-03-30 "
```

Since this is a long running transaction, in the response header, the uri for querying the operation and the uri for the result is returned as shown in the following response.

**Important Values**

* **Azure-AsyncOperation** - This property contains the URI to query the Async troubleshoot operation
* **Location** - This property contains the URI where the results are when the operation is complete

### Query the Async Operation for completion

Use the operations URI to query for the progress of the operation as seen in the following example:

```powershell
armclient get "https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/providers/Microsoft.Network/locations/westcentralus/operations/8a1167b7-6768-4ac1-85dc-703c9c9b9247?api-version=2016-03-30"
```

While the operation is in progress the response will show **InProgress** as seen in the following example:

```json
{
  "status": "InProgress"
}
```

When the operation is complete the status will change to **Succeeded**.

```json
{
  "status": "Succeeded"
}
```

### Retrieve the results

Once the status returned is **Succeeded**, call a GET Method on the operationResult uri to retrieve the results.

```powershell
armclient get "https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/147a22e9-2356-4e56-b3de-1f5842ae4a3b/providers/Microsoft.Network/locations/westcentralus/operationResults/8a1167b7-6768-4ac1-85dc-703c9c9b9247?api-version=2016-03-30"
```

The following responses are examples of a typical degraded response returned when querying the results of troubleshooting a gateway. See [Understanding the results](#understanding-the-results) to get clarification on what the properties in the response mean.

## Troubleshoot connections

The following example queries the status of a connection.

```powershell

$subscriptionId = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
$resourceGroupName = "ContosoRG"
$NWresourceGroupName = "NetworkWatcherRG"
$networkWatcherName = "NetworkWatcher_westcentralus"
$connectionName = "VNET2toVNET1Connection"
$storageAccountName = "contososa"
$containerName = "gwlogs"
$requestBody = @{
"TargetResourceId": "/subscriptions/${subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/${resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Network/connections/${connectionName}",
"Properties": {
"StorageId": "/subscriptions/${subscriptionId}/resourceGroups/${resourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/${storageAccountName}",
"StoragePath": "https://${storageAccountName}.blob.core.windows.net/${containerName}"
}

}
armclient post "https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/${subscriptionId}/ResourceGroups/${NWresourceGroupName}/providers/Microsoft.Network/networkWatchers/${networkWatcherName}/troubleshoot?api-version=2016-03-30 "
```

Since this is a long running transaction, in the response header, the uri for querying the operation and the uri for the result is returned as shown in the following response.

* **startTime** - This value is the time the troubleshoot api call started.
* **endTime** - This value is the time that the troubleshoot api call ended. 
* **code** - This value is a role up of the **results** collection.  If one item is not healthy it will return **UnHealty**.
* **results** - Results is a collection of results returned on the connection or the virtual network gateway
    * **id** - This value is the fault Type
