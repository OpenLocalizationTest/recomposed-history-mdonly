# Troubleshoot NSG flow issues with Azure Network Watcher NSG flow logging

NSG flow logs, which are a feature of Network Watcher allow you to view information about ingress and egress IP traffic on Network Security Groups. These flow logs show outbound and inbound flows on a per rule basis, the NIC the flow applies to, 5 tuple information about the flow (Source/Destination IP, Source/Destination Port, Protocol), and if the traffic was allowed or denied.

This log is enabled from diagnostics within a Network Security Group. To learn more about overall diagnostic logging on Network Security groups and how to enable the log visit [Log analytics for network security groups (NSGs)](../virtual-network/virtual-network-nsg-manage-log.md)

The following list is a listing of the properties that are returned within the NSG flow log:

* **time** - Time when the event was logged
* **systemId** - Network Security Group resource ID.
* **category** - The category of the event, this will always be NetworkSecurityGroupFlowEvent
* **resourceid** - The resource id of the NSG
* **operationName** - Always NetworkSecurityGroupFlowEvents
* **properties** - A collection of properties of the flow
	* **Version** - Version number of the Flow Log event schema
	* **flows** - A collection of flows. This will have multiple entries for different rules
		* **rule** - Rule for which the flows are listed
			* **flows** - a collection of flows
				* **mac** - The MAC address of the NIC for the VM where the flow was collected
				* **flowTuples** - A string that contains multiple properties for the flow tuple in comma separated format
					* **Time Stamp** - This is the time stamp of when the flow occurred in UNIX EPOCH format
					* **Source IP** - The source IP
					* **Destination IP** - The destination IP
					* **Source Port** - The source port
					* **Destination Port** - The destination Port
					* **Protocol** - The protocol of the flow. Valid values are **T** for TCP and **U** for UDP
					* **Traffic Flow** - The direction of the traffic flow. Valid values are **I** for inbound and **O** for outbound.
					* **Traffic** - Whether traffic was allowed or denied. Valid values are **A** for allowed and **D** for denied.
				

The following is an example of the results in the NSG flow event log.
