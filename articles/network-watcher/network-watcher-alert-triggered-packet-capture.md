# Use packet capture to do proactive network monitoring with Azure Functions

Network Watcher packet capture creates capture sessions to track traffic in and out of a virtual machine. The capture file can have a filter that is defined to track only the traffic you want to monitor. This data is then stored in a storage blob or locally on the guest machine. This capability can be started remotely from other automation scenarios like Azure Functions. Packet capture provides the capability of running proactive captures based on defined network anomalies. Other uses include gathering network statistics, gaining information on network intrusions, to debug client-server communications and much more.

Resources deployed in Azure are running 24/7. You or your staff cannot actively monitor the status of all resources 24/7. What happens if an issue occurs at 2am?

By using Network Watcher, Alerting, and Functions from within the Azure ecosystem, you can proactively respond to issues in your network with the data and tools to solve the problem.

## Before you begin

In this example, your VM is sending more TCP segments than usual, and you would like to be alerted. TCP Segments are used as an example, you could use any alert condition. When you are alerted, you want to have packet level data to understand why communication has increased so you can take steps to return the machine to regular communication.
This scenario assumes you have an existing instance of Network Watcher, and a resource group with a valid virtual machine to be used.

## Scenario

To automate this process, we create and connect an Alert on our VM to trigger when the incident occurs, and an Azure Function to call into Network Watcher.

This scenario will:

* Create an Azure function that starts a packet capture.
* Create an alert rule on a virtual machine
* Configure the alert rule to call the Azure function

## Creating an Azure Function and overview

The first step is to create an Azure function to process the alert and create a packet capture. 

The following list is an overview of the workflow that takes place.

1. An alert is triggered on your VM.
1. The alert calls your Azure Function via a webhook.
1. Your Azure Function processes the alert and starts a Network Watcher packet capture session.
1. Packet capture runs on the VM and collects traffic. 
1. The capture file is uploaded to a storage account for review and diagnosis 

Creating an Azure Function can be accomplished in the portal by following [Create your first Azure Function](../azure-functions/functions-create-first-azure-function.md). For this example, we chose an HttpTrigger-CSharp type function. 

> [!NOTE]
> Other languages are provided with Azure functions but may be experimental and not have full support like PowerShell and Python.

## Processing the alert and starting a packet capture session

It is now time to make calls into Network Watcher from within the Azure Function. Depending on the requirements, the implementation of this function is different. However, the general flow of the code is as such:

1. Process input parameters
2. Query existing packet captures verify limits and resolve name conflicts
3. Create a packet capture with appropriate parameters
4. Poll packet capture periodically until complete
5. Notify user that packet capture session is complete

The following example is C# that can be used in the Azure Function. There are values that need to be replaced for subscription, client id, tenant id, and client secret.

``` 

Once you have created your function, you need to configure your alert to call the URL associated with the function. To get this value, copy the Function URL from your function app.

![finding the function url][2]

If you require custom properties in the payload of the webhook POST request, refer [Configure a webhook on an Azure metric alert](../monitoring-and-diagnostics/insights-webhooks-alerts.md)

## Configure an alert on a VM

Alerts can be configured to notify individuals when a specific metric crosses a threshold assigned to it. In this example, the alert is on the TCP segments sent, but the alert can be triggered for many other metrics. In this example, an alert is configured to call a webhook to call the function.

### Create the alert rule

Navigate to an existing virtual machine and add an alert rule. More detailed documentation about configuring alerts can be found at [User Azure portal to create alerts for Azure services](../monitoring-and-diagnostics/insights-alerts-portal.md). 

![add vm alert rule to a virtual machine][1]

> [!NOTE]
> Some Metrics are not enabled by default. Learn more about how to enable addition metrics by visiting [Enable monitoring and diagnostics](../monitoring-and-diagnostics/insights-how-to-use-diagnostics.md)

Finally paste the URL from the preceding step into the webhook textbox on your alert. Click **OK** to save the alert rule.

![pasting the url to the alert rule][3]

## Downloading and viewing the capture file

If you save your capture to a storage account, then the capture file can be downloaded via the portal or programmatically. If the capture file is stored locally, the capture file is retrieved by logging in to the virtual machine. 

For instructions on downloading files from azure storage accounts, refer to [Get started with Azure Blob storage using .NET](../storage/storage-dotnet-how-to-use-blobs.md). Another tool that can be used is Storage Explorer. More information about Storage Explorer can be found here at the following link: [Storage Explorer](http://storageexplorer.com/)

Once your capture is downloaded, you can view it using any tool that can read a **.cap** file. The following are links to two of these tools:

[Microsoft Message Analyzer](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj649776.aspx)  
[WireShark](https://www.wireshark.org/)
