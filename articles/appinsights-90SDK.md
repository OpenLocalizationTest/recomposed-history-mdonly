# Application Insights SDK

### Coming soon

The Application Insights SDK lets you insert lines of code into your application to monitor user activities and log diagnostic data.

But although you can write the code, there aren't any reports to show the data. Application Insights is currently being ported from Visual Studio Online to Microsoft Azure. The reports are still on their way over.... 

However, one thing you can do right now is to [capture and search diagnostic event logs generated with Trace, NLog or Log4Net][diagnostics].
