# Configure Activity Log Alerts on Service Notifications
## Overview
This article shows you how to set up activity log alerts for service notifications using the Azure portal.  

[!NOTE] This feature is currently in private preview. Not all functionality may be available at this time.

You can receive an alert based on service notifications for your Azure subscription.  
You can configure the alert based on:
* The class of service notification (Incident, Maintenance, Information, etc.)
- The status of the notification (Active vs. Resolved)
- The level of the notifications (Informational, Warning, Error)

You can also the configure who the alert should be sent to:
* Select an existing Action Group
- Create a new Action Group (that can be later used for future alerts)

You can learn more about Action Groups [here](monitoring-action-groups.md)

You can configure and get information about service notification alerts using
* [Azure Portal](monitoring-activity-log-alerts-on-service-notifications.md)
- [Resource Manager templates](monitoring-create-activity-log-alerts-with-resource-manager-template.md)
