# Webhooks for Azure Activity Log alerts
As part of the definition of an Action Group you are able to configure Webhook endpoints to receive Activity Log Alerts notifications. Webhooks allow you to route these notification to other systems for post-processing or custom actions. This article shows what the payload for the HTTP POST to a webhook looks like.

[!NOTE] This feature is currently in private preview. Not all functionality may be available at this time.

For information on the setup and schema for Azure Activity Log alerts, [see this page instead](monitoring-activity-log-alerts.md).

## Authenticating the webhook
The webhook can authenticate using either of these methods:

***Needs Review***
1. **Token-based authorization** - The webhook URI is saved with a token ID, for example, `https://mysamplealert/webcallback?tokenid=sometokenid&someparameter=somevalue`
2. **Basic authorization** - The webhook URI is saved with a username and password, for example, `https://userid:password@mysamplealert/webcallback?someparamater=somevalue&foo=bar`

## Payload schema
The POST operation contains the following JSON payload and schema for all Activity Log-based alerts. This schema is similar to the one used by metric-based alerts.
