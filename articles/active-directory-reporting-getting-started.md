# Azure AD Reporting: Getting started

[AZURE.INCLUDE [active-directory-reporting-content-journey-selector](../includes/active-directory-reporting-content-journey-selector.md)]

## Sign into the Azure Management Portal

First, you'll need to sign into the Azure Management Portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com)  as a global or compliance administrator. You must also be an Azure subscription service administrator or co-administrator, or be using the "Access to Azure AD" Azure subscription.

## Navigate to Reports

To view Reports, navigate to the Reports tab at the top of your directory.

If this is your first time viewing the reports, you'll need to agree to a dialog box before you can view the reports. This is to ensure that it's acceptable for admins in your organization to view this data, which may be considered private information in some countries.

## Explore each report

Navigate into each report to see the data being collected and the sign ins processed. You can find a [list of all the reports here](articles/active-directory-reporting-what-it-is).

## Download the reports as CSV

Each report can be downloaded as a CSV (comma separated value) file. You can use these files in Excel, PowerBI or third-party analysis programs to further analyze your data.

To download any report as a CSV, navigate to the report and click "Download" at the bottom.
