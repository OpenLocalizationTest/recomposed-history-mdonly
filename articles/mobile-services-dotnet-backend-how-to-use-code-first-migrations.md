# How to make data model changes to a .NET backend mobile service

In a .NET backend mobile service project, the default Entity Framework Code First database initializer derives from the [DropCreateDatabaseIfModelChanges] class. This initializer tells Entity Framework to drop and recreate the database whenever it detects a data model change exposed by your [DbContext]. You should continue to use this initializer during local development of your mobile service project, and the .NET backend tutorials assume that you are using this initializer. However, for situations where you want to make data model changes and maintain existing data in the database, you must use Code First Migrations. Using Code First Migrations is also a good solution for publishing data model changes to Azure, since a SQL Databasecannot be dropped.

This topic shows how to use Code First Migrations to make data model changes to an existing SQL Database and without losing existing data. This procedure assumes that you have already published your mobile service project to Azure, that there is existing data in your database, and that the remote and local data models are still in sync.

>[WACOM.NOTE]We recommend that complete as much of your data model development as possible on your local computer before you publish to Azure. If you have already published your .NET backend mobile service project to Azure, and your SQL Database table schema does not match the current data model of your project, you must drop the tables or otherwise manually get them in sync before you try to publish using Code First Migrations. 

When you are developing a .NET backend mobile service project on your local computer, the easiest way to deal with data model changes is to continue to use the default initializer, which drops and recreates the database whenever a data model change is detected. This same approach does not work when republishing your project to Azure. The initializer fails because the runtime doesn't have permissions to drop a SQL Database in Azure, which is a good thing. 

>[WACOM.NOTE]When developing and testing your mobile service project against live Azure services, you should always use a mobile service instance that is dedicated for testing. You should never develop or test against a mobile service that is currently in production or being used by client apps.

## Drop tables in your SQL Database

Before you can get Migrations working in Azure against a SQL Database, you should manually drop any existing tables in the database schema used by your mobile service. Use the following steps to drop existing tables from your SQL Database. If you database schema is already in sync with the current data model, you can skip this and start with [Migrations].

1. Login to the [Azure Management Portal], select your mobile service, click the **Configure** tab, and click the **SQL Database** link. 

	![][0]

	This takes you to the portal page for the database used by your mobile service.

2. Click the **Manage** button and log in to your SQL Database server. 

	![][1]

3. In the SQL Database manager, click **Design**, click **Tables**, select a table in your mobile service's schema, click **Drop table**, and then **OK** to confirm.

	![][2]
   
4. Repeat the previous step for each table in the mobile service's schema.

	With the existing tables removed, Code First Migrations can be intialized on the SQL Database. Tables that do not belong to the mobile service's schema do not affect your mobile service and should not be dropped.

## <a name="migrations"></a>Enable Code First Migrations

Code First Migrations uses a snapshot method to generate code that, when executed, makes schema changes to the database. With Migrations, you can make incremental changes to your data model and maintain existing data in the database. The following steps turn on Migrations and apply data model changes in the project, the local database, and in Azure. 

1. In Visual Studio in the Solution Explorer, right-click the mobile service project and click **Set as startup project**.
 
2. From the **Tools** menu, expand **NuGet Package Manager**, then click **Package Manager Console**.

	This displays the Package Manager Console, which you will use to manage your Code First Migrations.

3. In the Package Manager Console, run the following command:

		PM> Enable-Migrations

	This turns on Code First Migrations for your project.

4. In the console, run the following command:

		PM> Add-Migration Initial

	This creates a new migration named *Initial*. Migration code is stored in the Migrations project folder.

5. Expand the App_Start folder, open the WebApiConfig.cs project file and add the following **using** statements:

		using System.Data.Entity.Migrations;
		using todolistService.Migrations;

	In the above code, you must replace the _todolistService_ string with the namespace of your project, which for the downloaded quickstart project is <em>mobile&#95;service&#95;name</em>Service.  
 
6. In this same code file, comment-out the call to the **Database.SetInitializer** method and add the following code after it:

        var migrator = new DbMigrator(new Configuration());
        migrator.Update();

	This disables the default Code First database initializer that drops and recreates the database and replaces it with an explicit request to apply the latest migration. At this point, any data model changes will result in an InvalidOperationException when the data is accessed, unless a migration has been created for it. Going forward, your service must use Code First Migrations to migrate data model changes to the database.

7.  Press F5 to start the mobile service project on the local computer.
 
	At this point, the database is in sync with the data model. If you provided seed data, you can verify it by clicking **Try it out**, **GET tables/todoitem**, then **Try this out** and **Send**. For more information, see [Seeding data in migrations].

8.   Now make a change to your data model, such as adding a new UserId property to the TodoItem type, rebuild the project, and then in the Package Manager, run the following command:

		PM> Add-Migration NewUserId
                                                               
	This creates a new migration named *NewUserId*. A new code file, which implements this change, is added in the Migrations folder  

9.  Press F5 again to restart the mobile service project on the local computer.

	The migration is applied to the database and the database is again in sync with the data model. If you provided seed data, you can verify it by clicking **Try it out**, **GET tables/todoitem**, then **Try this out** and **Send**. For more information, see [Seeding data in migrations].

10. Republish the mobile service to Azure, then run the client app to access the data and verify that data loads and no error occur. 

13. (Optional) In the [Azure Management Portal], select your mobile service, click the **Configure** tab, and click the **SQL Database** link. 

	![][0]

	This navigates to the SQL Database page for your mobile service's database.

14. (Optional) Click **Manage**, log in to your SQL Database server, then click **Design** and verify that the schema changes have been made in Azure.

##<a name="seeding"></a>Seeding data in migrations

You can have Migrations add seed data to the database when a migration is executed. The Configuration class has a Seed method that you can override to insert or update data. The Configuration.cs code file is added to the Migrations folder when Migrations are enabled. These examples show how to override the [Seed] method to seed data to the **TodoItems** table. The [Seed] method is called after migrating to the latest version. 

###Seed a new table

The following code seeds the **TodoItems** table with new rows of data:

        List<TodoItem> todoItems = new List<TodoItem>
        {
            new TodoItem { Id = "1", Text = "First item", Complete = false },
            new TodoItem { Id = "2", Text = "Second item", Complete = false },
        };

        foreach (TodoItem todoItem in todoItems)
        {
            context.Set<TodoItem>().Add(todoItem);
        }
        base.Seed(context);

###Seed a new column in a table

The following code seeds just the UserId column:
 		    
        context.TodoItems.AddOrUpdate(
            t => t.UserId,
                new TodoItem { UserId = 1 },
                new TodoItem { UserId = 1 },
                new TodoItem { UserId = 2 }
            );
        base.Seed(context);

This code calls the [AddOrUpdate] helper extension method to add seed data to the new UserId column. By using [AddOrUpdate], duplicate rows are not created.
