# How to retain a constant virtual IP address for an Azure cloud service
When you update a cloud service that's hosted in Azure, you might need to ensure that the virtual IP address (VIP) of the service doesn't change. Many domain management services use the Domain Name System (DNS) for registering domain names. DNS works only if the VIP remains the same. You can use the **Publish Wizard** in Azure Tools to ensure that the VIP of your cloud service doesn’t change when you update it. For more information about how to use DNS domain management for cloud services, see [Configuring a custom domain name for an Azure cloud service](cloud-services/cloud-services-custom-domain-name.md).

## Publishing a cloud service without changing its VIP
The VIP of a cloud service is allocated when you first deploy it to Azure in a particular environment, such as the Production environment. The VIP doesn’t change unless you delete the deployment explicitly or it is implicitly deleted by the deployment update process. To retain the VIP, you must not delete your deployment, and you must also make sure that Visual Studio doesn’t delete your deployment automatically. You can control the behavior by specifying deployment settings in the **Publish Wizard**, which supports several deployment options. You can specify a fresh deployment or an update deployment, which can be incremental or simultaneous, and both kinds of update deployments retain the VIP. For definitions of these different types of deployment, see [Publish Azure Application Wizard](vs-azure-tools-publish-azure-application-wizard.md).  In addition, you can control whether the previous deployment of a cloud service is deleted if an error occurs. The VIP might unexpectedly change if you don't set that option correctly.

## Updating a cloud service without changing its VIP
1. Create or open an Azure cloud service project in Visual Studio. 

1. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the project, and, from the context menu, select **Publish**.

1. In the **Publish Azure Application** dialog, select the Azure subscription to which you want to deploy, sign in if necessary, and select **Next**.

1. In the **Common Settings** tab, verify that the name of the cloud service to which you’re deploying, the **Environment**, the **Build Configuration**, and the **Service Configuration** are all correct.

1. In the **Advanced Settings** tab, verify that the storage account and the deployment label are correct, that the **Delete deployment on failure** check box is cleared, and that the **Deployment update** check box is selected. By selecting the **Deployment update** check box, you ensure that your deployment won't be deleted and your VIP won't be lost when you republish your application. By clearing the **Delete deployment on failure check box**, you ensure that your VIP won't be lost if an error occurs during deployment.

1. (Optional) To further specify how you want the roles to be updated, select **Settings** next to **Deployment update**. Select either **Incremental update** or **Simultaneous update**. If you choose **Incremental update**, each instance of your application is updated one after another, so that the application is always available. If you choose **Simultaneous update**, all instances of your application are updated at the same time. Simultaneous updating is faster, but your service might not be available during the update process. When done, select **Next**.

1. When returned to the **Publish Azure Application** dialog, select **Next** until the **Summary** page is displayed. Verify your settings, and then select **Publish**.
