# Get started with Azure Automation
This guide provides an introduction to Azure Automation and lists resources that you can access to learn and use it.  A tutorial is provided to assist you in configuring Azure Automation for first use, importing and running a simple runbook, and then determining the next steps that you will require to import and create more complex and useful runbooks for working with your Azure environment.


## What is Azure Automation?

Microsoft Azure Automation provides a way for users to automate the manual, long-running, error-prone, and frequently repeated tasks that are commonly performed in a cloud environment. You can create, monitor, manage, and deploy resources in your Azure environment using runbooks, which are based on Windows PowerShell workflows. 

 In this video, Eamon O'Reilly and Scott Hanselman introduce Azure Automation service. (Duration: 10:55)

## <a name="resources"></a>Resources

A variety of resources are available for you to learn how to use Azure Automation and create your own runbooks.

- [Azure Automation Library](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=392860) provides complete documentation on the configuration and administration of Azure Automation and for authoring your own runbooks. 
- [Azure PowerShell cmdlets](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj156055.aspx) provides information for automation Azure operations using Windows PowerShell.  Runbooks use these cmdlets to work with Azure resources.
- [Azure Automation Blog](http://azure.microsoft.com/blog/tag/azure-automation) provides the latest information on Azure Automation from Microsoft.
- [Automation Forum](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=390561) allows you to post questions about Azure Automation to be addressed by Microsoft and the Automation community.


## Samples and utility runbooks

Microsoft and the Automation community provide sample runbooks that can help you get started creating your own solutions and utility runbooks that you can use as building blocks for larger Automation tasks. You can either download these runbooks from [Script Center](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=393029) or import them directly into Azure Automation.  For more details, see [Runbook Gallery](http://aka.ms/runbookgallery).

# <a name="nextsteps">Next Steps 
1. This tutorial uses a simple runbook that does not manage Azure services. Most runbooks will use [Azure cmdlets](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/jj156055.aspx) that require authentication to your Azure subscription. You must follow the instructions at [Configuring Azure for Management by Runbooks](http://aka.ms/azureautomationauthentication) in order to configure your Azure subscription to work with these runbooks.  
2. Refer to the [Resources](#resources) listed above for information on obtaining existing runbooks and creating your own runbooks to use in Azure Automation.
3. Subscribe to the [Azure Automation Blog](http://azure.microsoft.com/blog/tag/azure-automation) to stay up to date with the latest information on Azure Automation.
