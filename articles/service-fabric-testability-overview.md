# Testability overview

Testability is a suite of tools specifically designed for testing your services built on Microsoft Azure Service Fabric. The tools allow you to easily induce meaningful faults and run test scenarios to exercise and validate the numerous different states and transitions your services will experience throughout their lifetimes, all in a controlled and safe manner.

## Right tools for the right job

Testability is all about executing runtime tests against your services using a set of PowerShell and C# APIs so you can write everything from test scripts that can be invoked via PowerShell in your development and test environments, to long-running services that continuously invoke test actions in production.

## Actions and scenarios

 With Testability we provide Actions and Scenarios to do the job. Actions are individual faults or actions that can be performed against your service. These are the building blocks for running tests against your service. For example:

  + Restart a node to simulate a any number of situations where a machine or VM is rebooted.
  + Move a replica of your stateful service to simulate load balancing, failover, or application upgrades.
  + Invoke quorum loss on a stateful service to create a situation where write operations can't proceed because there aren't enough "back-up" or "secondary" replicas to accept new data.
  + Invoke data loss on a stateful service to create a situation where all in-memory state is completely wiped out.

Scenarios are complete tests that are composed of one or more actions, and since actions are simply PowerShell commands and C# functions, they can take any shope or form: long-running services, PowerShell commands, command line applications, and so forth. In Testability we provide two scenarios out of the box:

  + Chaos Test
  + Failover Test

## Importance of Testability

Service Fabric makes the job of writing and managing distributed scalable applications significantly easier. Testability component in Service Fabric is aimed at making testing a distributed application similarly easier. There are three main issues that need to be solved while testing:

1. Simulating/Generating failures that might occur in the real world scenarios: One of the important aspects of Service Fabric is that it allows distributed applications to recover from various failures. However, in order to test that the application is able to recover from these failures we need a mechanism to simulate/generate these real world failures in a controlled test environment.
2. The ability to generate the correlated failures: While the basic failures in the system like network failure, machine failures are easy to produce individually. Generating the significant number of scenarios that can happen in the real world as a result of the interactions of these individual failures is non-trivial.
3. Unified experience across various levels of development and deployment: There are many fault injection systems that provide the ability to do various types of failures. However, the experience in all of these is jagged when moving from one box developer scenarios to running the same tests in large tests environments to using them for test in production.

While there are many mechanisms to solve the above mentioned problems, a system that does the same with required guarantees all the way from one box developer environment to test in production clusters is missing. The Testability component allows the application developers to test their business logic and not its interaction with the underlying distributed system.

### Simulating/Generating real word failure scenarios
In order to test the robustness of a distributed system against failures, we need a mechanism to generate failures. While in theory generating a failure like a node down seems easy, it starts hitting the same set of consistency problems that Service Fabric is trying to solve. As an example if we want to shutdown a node, the required workflow is the the following:

1. From the client issue a shutdown node request.
2. Send the request to the right node.
	1. If the node is not found it should fail.
	2. If the node is found it should return only if the node is shutdown.

From a test perspective, it needs to know that when this failure is induced the failure actually happens in order to verify the failure. The guarantee that windows fabric provides is that either the node will go down is already down. In either case the test should be able to correctly reason about the state and succeed or fail in its validation correctly. A system implemented outside of windows fabric to do the same set of failures could hit a plethora of network, hardware and software issues which would prevent it from providing the above stated guarantees. In the presence of the issues stated before Service Fabric will reconfigure the cluster state to work around the issues and hence the Testability would still be able to give the right set of guarantees.

### Generating required events and scenario
While simulating a real world failure consistently is tough to start with, the ability to generate correlated failures is even tougher. For example a data loss happens in a stateful persisted service when the following happens:

1. Only a write quorum of the replicas are caught up on replication. All the replicas lag behind the primary.
2. The write quorum goes down because of the replicas going down (due to code package or node going down).
3. The write quorum not being able to come back up because the data for the replicas is lost.

These correlated failure do happen (even though not as frequently as individual failures) in the real world. The ability to test for these scenario before they happen in production is critical. More so the ability to simulate these in production workload in controlled circumstances (middle of the day with all engineers on deck) is much preferred than it happening for the first time in production at 2:00 a. m. in the morning

### Unified experience across different environments
The practice traditionally has been to create three different sets of experiences, one for development environment, one for tests and one for production. The model was

1. In the development environment produce state transitions that allow unit tests of individual methods.
2. In the test environment produce failures to allow end to end tests exercising various failure scenarios.
3. Keep the production environment pristine disallowing any non-natural failures and ensuring there is extremely quick human response to failure.

In windows fabric through the Testability module and service, we are proposing to turn this around as use the same methodology from developer environment to production. There are two ways to achieve this:
1. In order to induce controlled failures use the Testability APIs from a one box environment all the way to production clusters.
2. To give the cluster a fever which causes automatic induction of failures, use the Testability service to generate automatic failures. Controlling the rate of failures through configuration allows the same service to be tested differently in different environments.

With Service Fabric, though the scale of failures would be different in the different environments the actual mechanism would be identical. This allows for a much quicker code to deployment pipeline and the ability to test the services while still being under real world load.

----------

In order to crate cloud scale services the ability to ensure that such services can stand real world failures before being deployed (and also while in production deployment) is very critical. Also in the services world today, the ability to quickly innovate and move code to production is very important. The Testability module in Service Fabric allows service developers to do the above precisely.
