##Overview

This tutorial shows how to use Mobile Apps in Azure App Service with a Windows Runtime 8.1 universal app. 

In this topic, you will create a new Mobile App backend, download and publish the server project, and download a "to do list" client app that connects to the new Mobile App backend. Mobile Apps provides you with all the backend functionality of App Service, but with additional features designed for mobile developers, including offline sync and push notifications. Native client libraries simplify cloud-based data storage and authentication in your apps. For more information, see [What are Mobile Apps](app-service-mobile-value-prop.md).

##Prerequisites

To complete this tutorial, you need the following:

* An active Azure account. If you don't have an account, you can sign up for an Azure trial and get up to 10 free mobile apps that you can keep using even after your trial ends. For details, see [Azure Free Trial](http://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/).

* [Visual Studio Community 2013] or a later version.

>[AZURE.NOTE] If you want to get started with Azure App Service before you sign up for an Azure account, go to [Try App Service](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=523751&appServiceName=mobile). There, you can immediately create a short-lived starter mobile app in App Serviceâ€”no credit card required, and no commitments.

##Create a new Azure mobile app backend

[AZURE.INCLUDE [app-service-mobile-dotnet-backend-create-new-service](../../includes/app-service-mobile-dotnet-backend-create-new-service.md)]

## Configure the server project

2. Back in the Mobile App backend settings, scroll down to **Mobile**, click **Get started** > **Windows (C#)**.

3. Under **Create a table API**, select your **Backend language**, either C# or Node.js:

	+ **.NET backend (C#)**:  
	Click **Download**, extract the compressed project files to your local computer, open the solution in Visual Studio, build the project to restore the NuGet packages, then deploy the project to Azure. To learn how to deploy an ASP.NET project to Azure, see the *Deploy the project to the web app* section of  [Create an ASP.NET web app in Azure App Service](../app-service-web/web-sites-dotnet-get-started.md#deploy-the-project-to-the-web-app).  
	When you first try to access data from your deployed Mobile App backend, a new *TodoItem* table is generated by Entity Framework Code First Migrations.
	 
	+ **JavaScript backend (Node.js)**:  
	Accept the acknowledgment and click **Create TodoItem table**. This creates a new *TodoItem* table in your database.
	 
		>[AZURE.IMPORTANT] Switching an existing app backend to Node.js will overwrite all site contents.

##Download and run the client project

Once you have configured your Mobile App backend, you can either create a new client app or modify an existing app to connect to Azure. In this section, you download a universal Windows app template project that is customized to connect to your Mobile App backend.

1. Back in the **Get started** blade for your Mobile App backend, click **Create a new app** > **Download**, then extract the compressed project files to your local computer.

3. (Optional) Add the universal Windows app project to the solution with the server project. This makes it easier to debug and test both the app and the backend in the same Visual Studio solution, if you choose to do so.

4. With the Windows Store app as the startup project, press the F5 key to rebuild the project and start the Windows Store app.

5. In the app, type meaningful text, such as *Complete the tutorial*, in the **Insert a TodoItem** text box, and then click **Save**.

	![](./media/app-service-mobile-windows-store-dotnet-get-started/mobile-quickstart-startup.png)

	This sends a POST request to the new mobile app backend that's hosted in Azure.

6. Stop debugging, right-click the `<your app name>.WindowsPhone` project, click **Set as StartUp Project**, and then press F5 again.

	Notice that data saved from the previous step is loaded from the mobile app after the Windows app starts.
