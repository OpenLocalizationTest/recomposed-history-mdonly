# Data Management Gateway – Release Notes

Microsoft Data Management Gateway is a client agent that enables cloud access for on-premises data sources within your organization.
To register on-premises data sources with the service portal, you first need to download, install, and configure a Data Management Gateway on an on-premises computer and then register the gateway with the cloud service. 
With the Data Management Gateway, you can:

- Refresh Excel workbooks with embedded PowerPivot models from SharePoint Online with on-premises data sources.
- Publish and index on-premises data sources as OData feeds.
- Copy data from on-premises data sources to cloud and vice versa.

Please refer to [Move data between on-premises and cloud using Azure Data Factory](data-factory-move-data-between-onprem-and-cloud.md) and http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=516909 for more information.
