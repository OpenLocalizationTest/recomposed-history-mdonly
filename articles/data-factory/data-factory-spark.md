## Introduction
The HDInsight Spark activity in a Data Factory [pipeline](data-factory-create-pipelines.md) executes Spark programs on [your own](data-factory-compute-linked-services.md#azure-hdinsight-linked-service) HDInsight cluster. This article builds on the [data transformation activities](data-factory-data-transformation-activities.md) article, which presents a general overview of data transformation and the supported transformation activities.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are new to Azure Data Factory, we recommend you go through the [Build your first pipeline](data-factory-build-your-first-pipeline.md) tutorial before you read this article. For an overview of Data Factory service, see [Introduction to Azure Data Factory](data-factory-introduction.md). 

## Apache Spark cluster in Azure HDInsight
First, create an Apache Spark cluster in Azure HDInsight by using the instructions in [Get started: Create Apache Spark cluster in Azure HDInsight](../hdinsight/hdinsight-apache-spark-jupyter-spark-sql.md). 

## Create data factory 
Here are the typical steps to create a data factory that invokes a Spark Activity.  

1. Create a data factory.
2. Create a linked service that links the Apache Spark cluster to your data factory.
3. Currently, you must specify an output dataset for an activity even if there is no output being produced. Therefore do the following steps:
	1. Create a linked service that links your Azure Storage account to the data factory.
	2. Create a dataset that refers to the Azure Storage linked service.  
3. Create a pipeline with Spark Activity that refers to the linked service created in #2. The activity is configured with the output dataset. The output dataset is what drives the schedule (hourly, daily, etc.). Therefore, you must specify the output dataset even though the activity does not really produce an output.

For detailed step-by-step instructions to create a data factory, see the tutorial: [Build your first pipeline](data-factory-build-your-first-pipeline.md). This tutorial uses a Hive Activity with a HDInsight Hadoop cluster but the steps are similar for using a Spark Activity with a HDInsight Spark cluster.   

The following sections provide information about creating Data Factory entities to use Apache Spark cluster and Spark Activity in your data factory.   

## HDInsight linked service
Before you use a Spark activity in a Data Factory pipeline, create a HDInsight (your own) linked service. The following JSON snippet shows the definition of a HDInsight linked service that points to an Azure HDInsight Spark cluster.   

```json
{
	"name": "HDInsightLinkedService",
	"properties": {
		"type": "HDInsight",
		"typeProperties": {
			"clusterUri": "https://<name of your HDInsight Spark Cluster>.azurehdinsight.net/",
	  		"userName": "admin",
	  		"password": "password",
	  		"linkedServiceName": "MyHDInsightStoragelinkedService"
		}
	}
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, the Spark Activity does not support Spark clusters using Data Lake Store as primary storage or on-demand HDInsight linked service. 

For details about the HDInsight linked service and other compute linked services, see [Data Factory compute linked services](data-factory-compute-linked-services.md) article. 

## Spark Activity JSON
Here is the sample JSON definition of a Spark activity in a pipeline:    

```json
{
    "name": "SparkPipeline",
    "properties": {
        "activities": [
            {
                "type": "HDInsightSpark",
                "typeProperties": {
                    "rootPath": "adfspark\\pyFiles",
                    "entryFilePath": "test.py",
					"arguments": [ "arg1", "arg2" ],
					"sparkConfig": {
						"spark.python.worker.memory": "512m"
					}
                    "getDebugInfo": "Always"
                },
                "outputs": [
                    {
                        "name": "OutputDataset"
                    }
                ],
                "scheduler": {
                    "frequency": "Day",
                    "interval": 1
                },
                "name": "MySparkActivity",
                "description": "This activity invokes the Spark program",
                "linkedServiceName": "HDInsightLinkedService"
            }
        ],
        "start": "2017-02-01T00:00:00Z",
        "end": "2017-02-02T00:00:00Z"
    }
}
```

The type properties (in the typeProperties section) are described later in this article in the [Spark Activity properties](#spark-activity-properties) section. 

As mentioned earlier, you must specify an output dataset for the activity as that is what drives the schedule of the pipeline (hourly, daily, etc.). In this example, an Azure Blob dataset is used. To create an Azure Blob dataset, you need to create an Azure Storage linked service first. Here are the sample definitions of Azure Storage linked service and Azure Blob dataset: 

**Azure Storage Linked service:**
```json
{
    "name": "AzureStorageLinkedService",
    "properties": {
        "description": "",
        "hubName": "spsparkdf_hub",
        "type": "AzureStorage",
        "typeProperties": {
            "connectionString": "DefaultEndpointsProtocol=https;AccountName=<storage account name>;AccountKey=<storage account key>"
        }
    }
}
```
 

**Azure Blob dataset:** 
```json
{
    "name": "OutputDataset",
    "properties": {
        "published": false,
        "type": "AzureBlob",
        "linkedServiceName": "AzureStorageLinkedService",
        "typeProperties": {
            "fileName": "sparkoutput.txt",
            "folderPath": "spark/output/",
            "format": {
                "type": "TextFormat",
                "columnDelimiter": "\t"
            }
        },
        "availability": {
            "frequency": "Day",
            "interval": 1
        }
    }
}
```

This dataset is more of a dummy dataset. Data Factory uses the frequency and interval settings and runs the pipeline daily within the start and end times of a pipeline. 

## Spark Activity properties

The following table describes the JSON properties used in the JSON definition: 

| Property | Description | Required |
| -------- | ----------- | -------- |
| name | Name for the activity in the pipeline. | Yes |
| description | Text describing what the activity does. | No |
| type | This property must be set to HDInsightSpark. | Yes |
| linkedServiceName | Reference to a HDInsight linked service on which the Spark program runs. | Yes |
| rootPath | The Azure Blob container and folder that contains the Spark file. The file name is case-sensitive. | Yes |
| entryFilePath | Relative path to the root folder of the Spark code/package | Yes |
| className | Application's Java/Spark main class | No | 
| arguments | A list of command-line arguments to the Spark program. | No | 
| proxyUser | The user account to impersonate to execute the Spark program | No | 
| sparkConfig | Spark configuration properties | No | 
| getDebugInfo | Specifies when the Spark log files are copied to the Azure storage used by HDInsight cluster (or) specified by sparkJobLinkedService. Allowed values: None, Always, or Failure. Default value: None. | No | 
| sparkJobLinkedService | The Azure Storage linked service that holds the Spark job file, dependencies, and logs.  If you do not specify a value for this property, the storage associated with HDInsight cluster is used. | No |

## Folder structure
The Spark activity does not support an in-line script as Pig and Hive activities do. Spark jobs are also more extensible than Pig/Hive jobs. For Spark jobs, you can provide multiple dependencies such as jar packages (placed in the java CLASSPATH), python files (placed on the PYTHONPATH), and any other files.

Create the following folder structure in the Azure Blob storage referenced by the HDInsight linked service. Then, upload dependent files to the appropriate sub folders in the root folder represented by **entryFilePath**. For example, upload python files to the pyFiles subfolder and jar files to the jars subfolder of the root folder. At runtime, Data Factory service expects the following folder structure in the Azure Blob storage:     

| Path | Description | Required | Type |
| ---- | ----------- | -------- | ---- | 
| .	| The root path of the Spark job in the storage linked service	| Yes | Folder |
| &lt;user defined &gt; | The path pointing to the entry file of the Spark job | Yes | File | 
| ./jars | All files under this folder are uploaded and placed on the java classpath of the cluster | No | Folder |
| ./pyFiles | All files under this folder are uploaded and placed on the PYTHONPATH of the cluster | No | Folder |
| ./files | All files under this folder are uploaded and placed on executor working directory | No | Folder |
| ./archives | All files under this folder are uncompressed | No | Folder |
| ./logs | The folder where logs from the Spark cluster are stored.| No | Folder |

Here is an example for a storage containing two Spark job files in the Azure Blob Storage referenced by the HDInsight linked service. 

```
SparkJob1
	main.jar
	files
		input1.txt
		input2.txt
	jars
		package1.jar
		package2.jar
	logs

SparkJob2
	main.py
	pyFiles
		scrip1.py
		script2.py
	logs	
```
