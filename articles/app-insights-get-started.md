# Application Insights - Start monitoring your app's health and usage

*Application Insights is in preview.*

Application Insights lets you monitor your live application for:

* **Availability** - We'll test your URLs every few minutes from around the world.
* **Performance**  - Detect and diagnose perf issues and exceptions.
* **Usage** - Find out what users are doing with your app, so that you can make it better for them.

Configuration is very easy, and you'll see results in minutes. We currently support ASP.NET web apps (on your own servers or on Azure).


## Get started

Start with any combination, in any order, of the entry points on the left of this chart. Pick the routes that work for you. If you're developing an ASP.NET web app, start by adding Application Insights to your web project - it's easy to add the other bits later.

You'll need an account in [Microsoft Azure](http://azure.com) (unless you use the VSO version).
