# Get started with Application Insights

*Application Insights is in preview.*

Detect issues, solve problems and continuously improve your applications. Quickly diagnose any problems in your live application. Understand what your users do with it.

Configuration is very easy, and you'll see results within minutes.

We currently support ASP.NET web applications and  WCF services, Windows Phone and Windows Store apps.

## Get started

Start with any combination, in any order, of the entry points on the left of this map. Follow the path that works for you.

You'll need an account in [Microsoft Azure](http://azure.com). You might already have access to a group account through your organization, or you might want to get a Pay-as-you-go account. (While Application Insights is in Preview, it's free.)
