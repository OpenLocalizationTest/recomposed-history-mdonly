# Application Insights - Start monitoring your app's health and usage

*Application Insights is in preview.*

Application Insights lets you monitor your live application for:

* **Availability** - We'll test your URLs every few minutes from around the world.
* **Performance**  - Detect and diagnose perf issues and exceptions.
* **Usage** - Find out what users are doing with your app, so that you can make it better for them.

Configuration is very easy, and you'll see results in minutes. We currently support ASP.NET web apps (on your own servers or on Azure).

You'll need an account in [Microsoft Azure](http://azure.com) (there's a free trial period).

There are two ways to get started with Application Insights:

* (Recommended) [Add Application Insights to your project in Visual Studio](#add) to monitor application performance and usage.
* [Install an agent on your server without redeploying][redfield] - Monitor a live website without redeploying it or touching your source code. This gives you performance and exception monitoring. You can add usage monitoring later.

>[WACOM.NOTE] There's an [older version of Application Insights](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn481095.aspx) in Visual Studio Online, which supports a broader range of application types. We're rebuilding it from the ground up as part of Microsoft Azure, and it's the new version that you're reading about here.


## <a name="add"></a>Add Application Insights to your project

You need [Visual Studio 2013 Update 3](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=397827&clcid=0x409) (or later).

### If it's a new project...

When you create a new project in Visual Studio 2013, make sure Application Insights is selected. 


![Create an ASP.NET project](./media/appinsights/appinsights-01-vsnewp1.png)

If this is your first time, you'll be asked login or sign up to Microsoft Azure Preview. (It's separate from your Visual Studio Online account.)

> No Application Insights option? Check you're using Visual Studio 2013 Update 3, that Application Insights Tools are enabled in Extensions and Updates, and that you're creating a web, Windows Store, or Windows Phone project.

### ... or if it's an existing project

Right click the project in Solution Explorer, and choose Add Application Insights.

![Choose Add Application Insights](./media/appinsights/appinsights-03-addExisting.png)

*There's one more step if you want to set up web usage analytics, but let's see some data first...*


### <a name="run"></a>2. Run your project

Run your application with F5 and try it out - open different pages.

In Visual Studio, you'll see a count of the events that have been received.

### <a name="monitor"></a>3. See monitor data

Open Application Insights from your project.

![Right-click your project and open the Azure portal](./media/appinsights/appinsights-04-openPortal.png)


Look for data in the **Application health** tiles. At first, you'll just see one or two points. For example:

![Click through to more data](./media/appinsights/appinsights-41firstHealth.png)

Click any tile to see more detail. [Learn more about the tiles and reports.][perf]


### <a name="webclient"></a>4. Set up web usage analytics

If you added Application Insights to an *existing* web project, you won't see anything yet in the Usage analytics tiles. There's one more step you need.

In Application Insights, choose Quick start, Instrument your website. 

![In your project in Application Insights, click Quick start, Instrument your website, and copy the code](./media/appinsights/appinsights-06webcode.png)

Copy the JavaScript code into the web pages that you want to monitor, just before the closing &lt;/head&gt; tag. In an ASP.NET project, a good way to monitor all the pages is to put the code in the master page, usually called `_SiteLayout` or `Views\Shared\_Layout`. Notice that the code contains the Application Insights key of your application.

Run your application again and you'll see data in **Usage analytics**.

![Click through to more data](./media/appinsights/appinsights-05-usageTiles.png)


### <a name="deploy"></a>5. Deploy your application

Deploy your application and watch the data accumulate.

Once you have a live application, [set up web tests][availability] to make sure it stays live.
