# Connect a web app to a storage account

In this scenario you will learn how to create an Azure storage account and an Azure web app. Then you will link the storage account to the web app using app settings.

Before running this script, ensure that a connection with Azure has been created using the `az login` command.

## Connect app sample

[!code-azurecli[main](../../../cli_scripts/app-service/connect-to-storage/connect-to-storage.sh?highlight=7-10 "Azure Storage")]

## Clean up deployment 

After the script sample has been run, the follow command can be used to remove the Resource Group, VM, and all related resources.

```azurecli
az group delete --name myResourceGroup
```
