# Deploy an ASP.NET Core App in a Docker Container using Azure CLI 2.0

In this scenario you will learn how to create a resource group, linux app service plan, web app and deploy an ASP.NET Core application using a docker container.

Before running this script, ensure that a connection with Azure has been created using the `az login` command.

## Create 

[!code-azurecli[main](../../cli_scripts/app-service/deploy-linux-docker/setup.sh?highlight=7-10 "Linux Docker")]

## Clean up deployment 

After the script sample has been run, the follow command can be used to remove the Resource Group, VM, and all related resources.

```azurecli
az group delete --name myResourceGroup
```
