# Monitor a web app using Web Server Logs using Azure CLI 2.0

In this scenario you will create a resource group, app service plan, web app and configure the web app to enable web server logs. You will then download the log files for review.

Before running this script, ensure that a connection with Azure has been created using the `az login` command.

## Create 

[!code-azurecli[main](../../../cli_scripts/app-service/monitor-with-logs/setup.sh?highlight=7-9 "Monitor Logs")]

## Clean up deployment 

After the script sample has been run, the follow command can be used to remove the Resource Group, VM, and all related resources.

```azurecli
az group delete --name myResourceGroup
```
