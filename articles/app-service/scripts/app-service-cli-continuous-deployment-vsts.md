# Create a web app with continuous deployment from Visual Studio Team Services

This sample script creates a web app in App Service with its related resources, and then sets up continuous deployment from a Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) repository. 

Before running this script, ensure the following:

- A connection with Azure has been created using the `az login` command.
- The application code is in a public or private Visual Studio Team Services repository that you own.
- You have [created an access token in VSTS](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/setup-admin/team-services/use-personal-access-tokens-to-authenticate).

## Create app sample

[!code-azurecli[main](../../../cli_scripts/app-service/deploy-vsts-continuous/deploy-vsts-continuous.sh?highlight=3-4 "Create a web app with continuous deployment from Visual Studio Team Services")]

## Clean up deployment 

After the script sample has been run, the follow command can be used to remove the Resource Group, web app, and all related resources.

```azurecli
az group delete --name myResourceGroup
```
