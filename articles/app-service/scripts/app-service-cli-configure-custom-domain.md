# Map a custom domain to a web app

This sample script creates a web app in App Service with its related resources, and then maps `www.<yourdomain>` to it. 

Before running this script, ensure that a connection with Azure has been created using the `az login` command, and that you have access to your domain registrar's DNS configuration page.

This sample works in a Bash shell. For options on running Azure CLI scripts on Windows client, see [Running the Azure CLI in Windows](../../virtual-machines/virtual-machines-windows-cli-options.md).

## Configure app sample

[!code-azurecli[main](../../../cli_scripts/app-service/configure-custom-domain/configure-custom-domain.sh?highlight=3 "Map a custom domain to a web app")]

## Clean up deployment 

After the script sample has been run, the follow command can be used to remove the Resource Group, web app, and all related resources.

```azurecli
az group delete --name $webappname
```
