# App Service Environment management addresses

The App Service Environment(ASE) is a deployment of the Azure App Service into a subnet in your Azure Virtual Network (VNet).  The ASE management traffic traverses the user owned network.  For details on the ASE networking dependencies read [Networking considerations and the App Service Environment][http://docs.microsoft.com/azure/app-service/app-service-environment/network-info]  

This document lists the source IPs for management traffic to the ASE. There are a set of IP addresses that are used across all ASE instances and then there are additional IPs that break down to a regional level.  The incoming management traffic comes in from these IP addresses to ports 454 and 455.

If you want to restrict access to ports 454 and 455 with a Network Security Group then you need to use the IPs that are in the All regions section as well as the IPs matching the region your ASE is deployed in.
