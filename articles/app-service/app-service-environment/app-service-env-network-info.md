# Networking considerations for an App Service Environment #

## Overview ##

There are two deployment types for the [App Service Environments][Intro] (ASE):

- _External ASE_ which exposes the ASE hosted apps on an internet accessible IP address. For more information, see [Create an External ASE][MakeExternalASE].
- _ILB ASE_ which exposes the ASE hosted apps on a an IP address inside your Azure Virtual Network(VNet).  The internal endpoint is an Internal Load Balancer which is why it is called an ILB ASE. For more information, see [Create and use an ILB ASE][MakeILBASE].

There are now two versions of the ASE. The initial version of the ASE is simply called ASEv1 and the newer version is called ASEv2. For information on ASEv1, see [Introduction to the App Service Environment v1][ASEv1Intro]. An ASEv1 can be deployed in a classic or resource manager VNet. An ASEv2 can only be deployed into a resource manager VNet.

All calls from an ASE that go to the internet leave the VNet through a VIP assigned for the ASE. The public IP of this VIP is then the source IP for all calls from the ASE that go to the internet.  If the apps in your ASE make calls to resources in your VNet or across a VPN then the source IP will be one of the IPs in the subnet used by your ASE.  Because the ASE is within the VNet, it can also access resources within the VNet without any additional configuration. If the VNet is connected to your on-premises network, then it also has access to resources there without any additional configuration of the ASE or your app.

![][1] 

If you have an External ASE, then that public VIP is also the endpoint that your ASE apps will resolve to for HTTP/S, FTP/S, web deploy and remote debugging.

![][2]

If you have an ILB ASE, then the IP address of the ILB is the endpoint for HTTP/S, FTP/S, web deploy and remote debugging.

The normal app access ports are:

| Use | From | To |
|----------|---------|-------------|
|  HTTP/HTTPS  | User configurable |  80, 443 |
|  FTP/FTPS    | User configurable |  21, 990, 10001-10020 |
|  Visual Studio remote debugging  |  User configurable |  4016, 4018, 4020, 4022 |

This is true if you are on an External ASE or on an ILB ASE. If you are on an External ASE, then those are the ports you hit on the public VIP. If you are on an ILB ASE, you would hit those ports on the ILB. It should be noted that if you lock down port 443, there can be an impact to some features exposed in the portal. For more information, see [Portal dependencies](#portaldep).

## ASE dependencies ##

An ASE inbound access dependency is:

| Use | From | To |
|-----|------|----|
| Management | Internet | ASE subnet: 454, 455 |
|  ASE internal communication | ASE subnet: all ports | ASE subnet: all ports
|  Allow Azure Load Balancer Inbound | Azure Load Balancer | Any

The inbound traffic provides command and control of the ASE in addition to system monitoring. The source IPs for this traffic are not constant. This means that the network security configuration needs to allow access from all IPs on ports 454 and 455.

For outbound access, an ASE depends on multiple external systems. Those system dependencies are defined primarily with DNS names. Again, do not map to a fixed set of IP addresses. This has the result of the ASE requiring outbound access from the ASE to arbitrary IPs across a wide variety of ports. An ASE has the following outbound dependencies:

| Use | From | To |
|-----|------|----|
| Azure Storage | ASE Subnet | table.core.windows.net, blob.core.windows.net, queue.core.windows.net, file.core.windows.net: 80, 443, 445 (445 is only need for ASEv1) |
| SQL Database | ASE Subnet | database.windows.net: 1433, 11000-11999, 14000-14999 (For more information, see [Sql Database V12 port usage](../../sql-database/sql-database-develop-direct-route-ports-adonet-v12.md))|
| Azure management | ASE Subnet | management.core.windows.net, management.azure.com: 443 
| SSL certificate verification |  ASE Subnet            |  ocsp.msocsp.com, mscrl.microsoft.com, crl.microsoft.com: 443
| Azure Active Directory        | ASE Subnet            |  Internet: 443
| App Service management        | ASE Subnet            |  Internet: 443
| Azure DNS                     | ASE Subnet            | Internet: 53
| ASE internal communication    | ASE subnet: all ports | ASE subnet: all ports

If the ASE loses access to these dependencies, it will cease working. When that happens long enough, the ASE will become suspended.

**Customer DNS**

If the VNet is configured with a customer defined DNS server, then the tenant workloads will use it. The ASE still needs to communicate with Azure DNS for management purposes. 

If the VNet is configured with a customer DNS on the other side of a VPN, the DNS server must be reachable from the subnet containing the ASE.

## Portal Dependencies ##

In addition to the functional dependencies that an ASE has, there are a few extra items related to the portal experience. Some of the capabilities in the Azure portal depend on direct access to _SCM site_. For every app in the Azure App Service there are two URLs. The first URL is to access your app. The second URL is to access the SCM site, which is also called the _Kudu console_. Some of the features that use the SCM site include:

-   Web jobs
-   Functions
-   Logstream
-   Kudu
-   Extensions
-   Process Explorer
-   Console

This is most challenging when using an ILB ASE, since the SCM site is not internet accessible outside of the VNet. For this reason, those capabilities that depend on SCM site access are greyed out in the Azure portal when your app is hosted on an ILB ASE.

Many of those capabilities that depend upon the SCM site are also available directly in the Kudu console. You can directly connect to it rather than using the portal. If your app is hosted in an ILB ASE, you will need to log in using your publishing credentials. The URL to access the SCM site of an app hosted in an ILB ASE has the following format: 

```
<appname>.scm.<domain name the ILB ASE was created with> 
```

So, if your ILB ASE is the domain name *contoso.net* and your app name is *testapp*, my app will be reached at *testapp.contoso.net* and the SCM site that goes with it will be reached at *testapp.scm.contoso.net*.

## ASE IP addresses ##

An ASE has more than a few IP addresses to keep track of. They are:

- Public inbound IP address – used for app traffic in an External ASE, and management traffic in both an External ASE and an ILB ASE.
- Outbound public IP - used as the "from" IP for outbound connections from the ASE that leave the VNet, which are not routed down a VPN.
- ILB IP address - if you are using an ILB ASE.
- App assigned IP-based SSL addresses - only possible with an External ASE and when IP based SSL is configured.

All of these IP addresses are easily visible in an ASEv2 in the Azure Portal from the ASE UI. If you have an ILB ASE, then the IP for the ILB will be listed.

![][3]

**App Assigned IP Addresses**

With an External ASE, you can assign IP addresses to individual apps. You cannot do that with an ILB ASE. For more information on configuring your app to have its own IP address, see [Bind an existing custom SSL certificate to Azure Web Apps](../../app-service-web/app-service-web-tutorial-custom-ssl.md).

When an app has its own IP-based SSL address, the ASE reserves two ports to map to that IP address. One port is for HTTP traffic, and the other is for HTTPS. Those ports are listed in the ASE UI in the IP addresses section. Traffic must be able to reach those ports from the VIP or the apps will not be accessible. This is an important thing to keep in mind when configuring Network Security Groups.

## Network Security Groups ##

[Network Security Groups][NSGs] (NSGs) provide the ability to control network access within a VNet. When you use the portal, there is an implicit deny rule at the lowest priority to deny everything so what you build are your allow rules.

In an ASE, you don't have access to the VMs used to host the ASE itself. They are in a Microsoft managed subscription. If you want to restrict access to the apps on the ASE, then you need to set NSGs on the ASE subnet. In doing so, you need to pay careful attention to the ASE dependencies. If you block any dependencies, the ASE will cease to work.

NSGs can be configured through the Azure Portal or via PowerShell. For the sake of simplicity, the information here shows the Azure Portal. You create and manage NSGs in the portal as a top-level resource under **Networking**.

Taking into account the inbound and outbound requirements, the NSGs should look similar to what is shown below. In this example, the VNet address range is _192.168.250.0/16_ and the subnet that the ASE is in is _192.168.251.128/25_.

The first two inbound requirements for the ASE to function are at the top in this example. They enable ASE management and allow the ASE to communicate with itself. The other entries are all tenant configurable and can govern network access to the ASE hosted applications.   

![][4]

In addition to a default rule to enable the IPs in the VNet to talk to the ASE subnet, there is also a default rule that enables the load balancer, aka the public VIP, to communicate with the ASE.  You can see the default rules by clicking *Default rules* next to the *Add* icon. If you were to put a deny everything else rule after the NSG rules shown, you would prevent traffic between the VIP and the ASE. If you wish to prevent traffic coming from inside the VNet, be sure to add your own rule to allow inbound with a source equal to AzureLoadBalancer with a destination of Any and a port range of \*.  Since the NSG rule is being applied just to the ASE subnet you do not need to be specific in the destination.

If you assigned an IP address to your app, then you will also need to make sure you keep the ports used with that open. You can see the ports used in the **App Service Environment** > **IP Addresses** UI.  

All but the last item shown in the outbound rules noted below are needed. They enable network access to the ASE dependencies that were noted earlier in this document. If you block any of them, then your ASE will cease to function. The last item in the list enables your ASE to communicate with other resources in your VNet.

![][5]

After your NSGs are defined, you need to assign them to the subnet that your ASE is on. If you don’t remember the ASE VNet or subnet, you can see it from the ASE management portal. To assign the NSG to your subnet, go to the subnet UI and select the NSG.

## Routes ##

Routes become problematic most commonly when you configure your VNet with ExpressRoute. There are 3 types of routes in an Azure VNet. There are:

-   System routes
-   BGP routes
-   User Defined Routes (UDRs)

BGP routes override System routes. UDRs override BGP routes. For more information about routes in Azure Virtual Networks, see [User Defined Routes overview][UDRs]

The SQL Database that the ASE uses to manage the system has a whitelist, and requires communication to originate from the ASE public VIP. If replies to incoming management requests are sent down the ExpressRoute, then the reply address will be different than the destination, which breaks the TCP communication.

What all this means is that, for your ASE to work while your VNet is configured with an ExpressRoute, the easiest thing to do is:

-   Configure ExpressRoute to advertise _0.0.0.0/0_, which by default force tunnels all outbound traffic on-premises.
-   Create a UDR, and apply it to the subnet that contains the App Service Environment, with an address prefix of _0.0.0.0/0_ and a next hop type of _Internet_.

The combination of the two changes results in traffic from the ASE to the internet not being forced down the ExpressRoute.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The routes defined in a UDR must be specific enough to take precedence over any routes advertised by the ExpressRoute configuration. The example above uses the broad 0.0.0.0/0 address range, and as such can potentially be accidentally overridden by route advertisements that use more specific address ranges.
>

App Service Environments are not supported with ExpressRoute configurations that cross-advertise routes from the public peering path to the private peering path. ExpressRoute configurations, that have public peering configured, will receive route advertisements from Microsoft for a large set of Microsoft Azure IP address ranges. If these address ranges are cross-advertised on the private peering path, the end result is that all outbound network packets from the App Service Environment's subnet will be force-tunneled to a customer's on-premises network infrastructure. This network flow is currently not supported with App Service Environments. One solution to this problem is to stop cross-advertising routes from the public peering path to the private peering path.

To create a UDR as described:

1.  Go to the Azure Portal > **Networking** > **Route Tables**.
2.  Create a new Route Table in the same region as your VNet.
3.  From within your Route Table UI, select **Routes** > **Add**.
4.  Set the **Next hop type** to **Internet** and the **Address prefix** to _0.0.0.0/0_ and click  **Save**.

You will then see something like this:

![][6]

After you have created the new route, go to the subnet containing your ASE. Select your Route Table from the list you get in the portal. After saving the change, you should then see your NSGs and Routes noted with your subnet.

### Deploying into existing Azure Virtual Networks that are integrated with ExpressRoute ###

If you want to deploy your ASE into a VNet that is already integrated with ExpressRoute, then you need to pre-configure the subnet you want the ASE deployed into and then deploy using an ARM template. To create an ASE in a VNet that already has ExpressRoute configured:

- Create a subnet to host the ASE.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Nothing else can be in the subnet but the ASE, and be sure to pick a large enough address space to allow for future growth, because this cannot be changed later. A `/25` with 128 addresses is the recommended size.
- Create UDRs (i.e. Route Tables) as described earlier and set that on the subnet.
- Create the ASE using an ARM template as described here: [Creating an ASE using an ARM Template][MakeASEfromTemplate].
