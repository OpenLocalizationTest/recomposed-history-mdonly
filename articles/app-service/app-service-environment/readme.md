# App Service Environment Documentation
The App Service Environment is an Azure App Service feature that provides a fully isolated and dedicated environment for securely running Azure App Service apps at high scale. This capability can host your [Web Apps][webapps], [Mobile Apps][mobileapps], [API Apps][APIApps], and [Functions][Functions].

App Service Environments are ideal for application workloads that require:

* Very high scale
* Isolation and secure network access

Customers can create multiple App Service Environments within a single Azure region, as well as across multiple Azure regions. This makes App Service Environments ideal for horizontally scaling state-less application tiers in support of high RPS workloads.

App Service Environments are isolated to running only a single customer's applications, and are always deployed into a virtual network. Customers have fine-grained control over both inbound and outbound application network traffic using [network security groups][NSGs]. Applications can also establish high-speed secure connections over virtual networks to on-premises corporate resources.

Apps frequently need to access corporate resources such as internal databases and web services. Apps running on App Service Environments can access resources reachable via [Site-to-Site][SiteToSite] VPN and [Azure ExpressRoute][ExpressRoute] connections.
