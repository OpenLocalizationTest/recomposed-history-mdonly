The Azure Table storage service enables you to store large amounts of structured data. The service is a NoSQL datastore that accepts authenticated calls from inside and outside the Azure cloud. Azure tables are ideal for storing structured, non-relational data.  See [How to use Table Storage from .NET](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/storage-dotnet-how-to-use-tables/#create-table "How to use Table Storage from .NET") for more information.

To programmatically access tables in ASP.NET vNext projects, you need to do the following tasks.

1. Add the following code namespace declaration to the top of any C# file in which you wish to programmatically access Azure Storage.

		using Microsoft.Framework.ConfigurationModel;

2. Use the following code to get the configuration setting.

		var config = new Configuration();
		config.AddJsonFile("config.json");

#####Get the storage connection string
Before you can do anything with a table, you need to get the connection string for the storage account the tables will live in. You can use the **CloudStorageAccount** type to represent your storage account information. If youâ€™re using an ASP.NET vNext project, you can you call the get method of the Configuration object to get your storage connection string and storage account information from the Azure service configuration, as shown in the following code.

	CloudStorageAccount storageAccount = CloudStorageAccount.Parse(
      config.get("MicrosoftAzureStorage:<storageAccountName>_AzureStorageConnectionString"));
