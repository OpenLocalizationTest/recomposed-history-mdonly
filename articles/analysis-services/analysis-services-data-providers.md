## Data providers

Data providers, also known as client libraries, are typically installed by client applications such as Power BI Desktop and Excel that connect to Analysis Services servers. For other interfaces, such as TOM, AsCmd, ADOMD.NET, you may need to install the latest provider data providers. 

All applications connecting to Analysis Services do so using one of these providers. ADOMD.NET and Analysis Services Management Objects (AMO), are managed data providers. The Analysis Services OLE DB provider (MSOLAP DLL) is a native data provider.
