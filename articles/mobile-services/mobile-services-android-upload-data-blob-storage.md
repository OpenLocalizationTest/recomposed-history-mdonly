# Upload images from Android device to Azure Storage

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-selector-upload-data-blob-storage](../../includes/mobile-services-selector-upload-data-blob-storage.md)]

This topic shows you how to use Azure Mobile Services to enable your Android app to upload and store user-generated images in Azure Storage. Mobile Services uses a SQL Database to store data. However, binary large object (BLOB) data is more efficiently stored in Azure Blob storage service. 

You cannot securely distribute with the client app the credentials required to securely upload data to the Blob Storage service. Instead, you must store these credentials in your mobile service and use them to generate a Shared Access Signature (SAS) that is used to upload a new image. The SAS, a credential with a short expiration--in this case 5 minutes, is returned securely by Mobile Services to the client app. The app then uses this temporary credential to upload the image. In this example, downloads from the Blob service are public.

In this tutorial you add functionality to the Mobile Services quickstart app to take pictures and upload the images to Azure by using a SAS generated by Mobile Services. 


## What you need to get started

This tutorial is based on the Mobile Services quickstart. Before you start this tutorial, you must first complete [Get started with Mobile Services]. 

This tutorial also requires the following:

+ An [Azure Storage account](../storage-create-storage-account.md)
+ A camera or other image capture device attached to your computer.

##<a name="update-scripts"></a>Update the registered insert script in the Management Portal

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-configure-blob-storage](../../includes/mobile-services-configure-blob-storage.md)]

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-windows-store-dotnet-upload-to-blob-storage](../../includes/mobile-services-windows-store-dotnet-upload-to-blob-storage.md)]

##<a name="install-storage-client"></a>Install the Storage client for Android apps

To be able to use an SAS to upload images to Blob storage, you must first add the reference to the Storage client library for Android apps.

In the **app** **build.gradle** file, add this line to the `dependencies` section:

		compile 'com.microsoft.azure.android:azure-storage-android:0.5.1@aar'

  	This adds the client library for Azure storage services to the project.

## Update the quickstart app to capture and upload images.

1. Specify your app depends on having a camera by adding this line to **AndroidManifest.xml**:

		<uses-feature android:name="android.hardware.camera"
                  android:required="true" />
