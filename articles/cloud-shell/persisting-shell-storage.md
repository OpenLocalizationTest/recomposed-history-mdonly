# Persisting Azure Cloud Shell files
On initial start, Azure Cloud Shell asks for your subscription to create an LRS storage account and Azure file share for you.

![](media/storage-create.png)

This file share will mount as `clouddrive` under your $Home directory. This file share is also used to store a 5-GB image created for you that automatically updates and persists your $Home directory. This is a one-time action and automatically mounts for subsequent sessions.

Cloud Shell persists files with both methods below:
1. Create a disk image of your $Home directory to persist files within $Home. 
This disk image is saved in your specified file share as `<User>.img` at `fileshare.storage.windows.net/fileshare/.cloudconsole/<User>.img`

2. Mount specified file share as `clouddrive` in your $Home directory for direct file share interaction. 
`/Home/<User>/clouddrive` is mapped to `fileshare.storage.windows.net/fileshare`.
 
## Using "createclouddrive"
Cloud Shell allows users to run a command called `createclouddrive` that enables manually associating an existing or new Azure file share to Cloud Shell. When successfully run, Cloud Shell searches for this file share on every start-up to mount and provide access to files held in the file share.

### Pre-requisites for manual mounting
Cloud Shell will create a storage account and file share for you on first launch, however you may update the file share with the `createclouddrive` command. Storage is subject to [regular Azure Files pricing.](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/storage/files/)

If mounting an existing file share, storage accounts must be:
1. LRS or GRS to support file shares.
2. Located in one of the following regions:

### Supported storage regions
Your storage account and file share must exist in one of the following regions.
|Area|Region|
|---|---|
|Americas|East US, South Central US, West US|
|Europe|North Europe, West Europe|
|Asia Pacific|India Central, Southeast Asia|

## Mount clouddrive
1. Run `createclouddrive` with the following parameters <br>

```
createclouddrive -s mySubscription -g myRG -n storageAccountName -f fileShareName
```

To see more details run `createclouddrive -h`: <br>
```
Options:
  -s | --subscription id            Subscription ID or name.
  -g | --resource-group group       Resource group name.
  -n | --storage-account name       Storage account name.
  -F | --force                      Skip prompts for resource creation and shell restart.
  -f | --file-share name            Fileshare name.
  -d | --disk-size size             Disk size in GB. (default 5 GB)
  -? | -h | --help                  Shows this usage text.
```

## List clouddrive
To find details on `clouddrive`:
1. Run `df` 

The filepath to clouddrive will show your storage account name and fileshare in the url.

`//storageaccountname.file.core.windows.net/filesharename`

```
justin@Azure:~$ df
Filesystem                                          1K-blocks   Used  Available Use% Mounted on

```

## Remove clouddrive

You may unmount a file share mounted to Cloud Shell at any time.

> [!NOTE]
> Cloud Shell requires a file share to access, you will be prompted to create and mount a new file share on next session if removed.

> [!WARNING]
> Deleting the resource group, storage account, or file share mapped to Cloud Shell will erase all files in your $Home directory and any files > in your file share. This cannot be undone.

To detach a file share from Cloud Shell:
1. Run `removeclouddrive`
2. Confirm prompts as your current session will be lost. $Home directory files will continue to exist in your file share. Cloud Shell cannot be accessed until a file share is associated.

Cloud Shell will no longer search for this file share on subsequent sessions. The storage resources still exist unless actively deleted.

## Update clouddrive
Run `createclouddrive` specifying a new file share

> [!NOTE]
> Your $Home directory will reset as your $Home disk image is held in the previous file share.

## Upload or download local files
Utilize Azure portal to upload or download files to/from storage.
Editing/removing/adding files from within Cloud Shell is reflected in the File Storage GUI on blade refresh.

1. Navigate to the mounted fileshare
![](media/touch-txt-storage.png)
2. Select target file in Portal
3. Hit "Download"
![](media/download-storage.png)

If you need to download a file that only exists in your $Home directory:
1. Copy file to `/<User>/clouddrive` <br>
2. Follow [previous steps](#upload-or-download-local-files) <br>

## Cloud Shell tagging
Cloud Shell adds a "tag" to mounted storage accounts using the format: <br>

| Key | Value |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
|cloud-console-files-for-user@domain.com|fileshareName|

Use these tags to see which users map to certain file shares and where certain $Home images can be found.
