# Azure Cloud Shell (Preview) limitations
Azure Cloud Shell has the following known limitations.

## System state and persistence
The machine providing your Cloud Shell session is temporary and is recycled after your session is inactive for 10 minutes. Cloud Shell requires a file share to be mounted.
* With mounted storage only modifications within your `$Home` directory or `clouddrive` directory are persisted
  * File shares can only be mounted from [supported regions](persisting-shell-storage.md#supported-storage-regions)
  * Azure Files only supports LRS and GRS storage accounts

## User permissions
Permissions are set as regular users without sudo access. Any installation outside of your $Home will not persist.
Certain commands such as `git clone` within the `clouddrive` directory do not have proper permissions, however your $Home directory does.

## Browser support
Cloud Shell supports the latest versions of Microsoft Edge, Microsoft Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, and Apple Safari. Safari in private mode is not supported.

## Copy/paste
Ctrl-v and Ctrl-c do not function on Windows, please us Ctrl-insert and Shift-insert to copy/paste respectively.
Utilize right-click copy paste options if needed as well, however Firefox and Internet Explorer do not support right-click permissions.

## Usage limits
Cloud Shell is intended for interactive use cases, as a result any long-running non-interactive sessions are ended without warning.

## Network connectivity
Any latency in the Cloud Shell is subject to local internet connectivity, Cloud Shell will continue to attempt functioning to any instructions sent.
