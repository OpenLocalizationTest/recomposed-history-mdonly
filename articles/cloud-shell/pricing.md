# Pricing
Azure Cloud Shell is provided for free, but requires an attached Azure file share to use. Cloud Shell creates a default 5GB image in your file share to persist your $HOME directory. Azure file shares incur regular costs.

Check [here for details on Azure Files costs](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/storage/files/).
