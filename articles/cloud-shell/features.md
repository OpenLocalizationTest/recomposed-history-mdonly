# Features & Tools for Azure Cloud Shell
Azure Cloud Shell is a browser-based shell experience to manage and develop Azure resources.

Cloud Shell offers a browser-accessible, pre-configured shell experience for managing Azure resources without the overhead of installing, versioning, and maintaining a machine yourself.

Cloud Shell provisions machines on a per-request basis and as a result machine state will not persist across sessions. 
Since Cloud Shell is built for interactive sessions, shells automatically terminate after 20 minutes of shell inactivity.

## Secure automatic authentication
Cloud Shell securely and automatically authenticates account access for the Azure CLI 2.0.

## Azure Files persistence
Since Cloud Shell is allocated on a per-request basis using a temporary machine, files outside of your $Home and machine state are not persisted across sessions.
To persist files across sessions, Cloud Shell walks you through attaching an Azure file share on first launch.
Once completed Cloud Shell will automatically attach your storage for all future sessions.
