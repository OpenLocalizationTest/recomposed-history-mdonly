# How to add a users to an elastic database pool

The elastic database job allows you to run the same script against every database in an [elastic database pool](sql-database-elastic-pool.md). To run the script, a user with the appropriate permissions must be added to every database in the pool. This is done with a combination of PowerShell and TSQL. First, a SQL Server login is created on the "master" database known as the control database. The login is needed to create a user on each database. Then a PowerShell script logs into each database in the pool and runs the CREATE USER statement. For more information, see [Managing Databases and Logins in Azure SQL Database](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/ee336235.aspx?f=255&MSPPError=-2147217396) or [Adding Users to Your SQL Azure Database](http://azure.microsoft.com/blog/2010/06/21/adding-users-to-your-sql-azure-database/)

## Prerequisites
Create an elastic database pool. See (sql-database-elastic-pool.md)

Azure PowerShell and the Azure Resource Manager module. See [Create an Azure SQL Database elastic pool using Azure PowerShell](sql-database-elastic-pool-powershell.md#prepare-your-environment).


## How to add the users to the databases

1.	Log into the **control** database using the user name and password that was created when installing the elastic job tool.  
2.	Run the following script to create a new login using the same name as the administrator.

		CREATE LOGIN <*username*> WITH password='1231!#ASDF!a';
3. Run the following PowerShell script to find all the databases in the pool.

		Code To be determined
4. Edit the following PowerShell script to include all the database names.

		Code To be determined
5. Run the PowerShell script.

		Code To be determined

## Next steps

Run a job against the database pool. See [Creating and managing elastic database jobs](sql-database-elastic-jobs-create-and-manage.md).
