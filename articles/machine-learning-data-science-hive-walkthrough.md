# Azure Data Science Process in Action - Using Azure HDInsight Hadoop Clusters

In this tutorial, you will follow the Azure Data Science Process map end-to-end using an Azure HDInsight Hadoop cluster to build and deploy a model using a publicly available dataset -- the [NYC Taxi Trips](http://www.andresmh.com/nyctaxitrips/) dataset. This tutorial needs to be carried out on **Windows** computers since the steps of [Getting the Data from Public Source](#getdata) and [Uploading the Data to the Default Container of Azure HDInsight Hadoop Cluster](#upload) use AzCopy, which is a Windows software. The other steps in this tutorial can run on both Windows and Ubuntu Linux systems.

## <a name="dataset"></a>NYC Taxi Trips Dataset Description

The NYC Taxi Trip data is about 20GB of compressed CSV files (~48GB uncompressed), comprising more than 173 million individual trips and the fares paid for each trip. Each trip record includes the pickup and drop-off location and time, anonymized hack (driver's) license number and medallion (taxiâ€™s unique id) number. The data covers all trips in the year 2013 and is provided in the following two datasets for each month:

1. The 'trip_data' CSV contains trip details, such as number of passengers, pickup and dropoff points, trip duration, and trip length. Here are a few sample records:

		medallion,hack_license,vendor_id,rate_code,store_and_fwd_flag,pickup_datetime,dropoff_datetime,passenger_count,trip_time_in_secs,trip_distance,pickup_longitude,pickup_latitude,dropoff_longitude,dropoff_latitude

2. The 'trip_fare' CSV contains details of the fare paid for each trip, such as payment type, fare amount, surcharge and taxes, tips and tolls, and the total amount paid. Here are a few sample records:

		medallion, hack_license, vendor_id, pickup_datetime, payment_type, fare_amount, surcharge, mta_tax, tip_amount, tolls_amount, total_amount
		89D227B655E5C82AECF13C3F540D4CF4,BA96DE419E711691B9445D6A6307C170,CMT,2013-01-01 15:11:48,CSH,6.5,0,0.5,0,0,7
		0BD7C8F5BA12B88E0B67BED28BEA73D8,9FD8F69F0804BDB5549F40E9DA1BE472,CMT,2013-01-06 00:18:35,CSH,6,0.5,0.5,0,0,7
		0BD7C8F5BA12B88E0B67BED28BEA73D8,9FD8F69F0804BDB5549F40E9DA1BE472,CMT,2013-01-05 18:49:41,CSH,5.5,1,0.5,0,0,7
		DFD2202EE08F7A8DC9A57B02ACB81FE2,51EE87E3205C985EF8431D850C786310,CMT,2013-01-07 23:54:15,CSH,5,0.5,0.5,0,0,6
		DFD2202EE08F7A8DC9A57B02ACB81FE2,51EE87E3205C985EF8431D850C786310,CMT,2013-01-07 23:25:03,CSH,9.5,0.5,0.5,0,0,10.5

The unique key to join trip\_data and trip\_fare is composed of the fields: medallion, hack\_licence and pickup\_datetime.

There are 12 trip 'trip_data' and 'trip_fare' files, respectively. In the file names, numbers 1-12 represents the months that the trips are made. 

## <a name="mltasks"></a>Examples of Prediction Tasks

We will formulate three prediction problems based on the *tip\_amount*, namely:

1. Binary classification: Predict whether or not a tip was paid for a trip, i.e. a *tip\_amount* that is greater than $0 is a positive example, while a *tip\_amount* of $0 is a negative example.

2. Multiclass classification: To predict the range of tip paid for the trip. We divide the *tip\_amount* into five bins or classes:
	
		Class 0 : tip_amount = $0
		Class 1 : tip_amount > $0 and tip_amount <= $5
		Class 2 : tip_amount > $5 and tip_amount <= $10
		Class 3 : tip_amount > $10 and tip_amount <= $20
		Class 4 : tip_amount > $20

3. Regression task: To predict the amount of tip paid for a trip.  


## <a name="setup"></a>Setting Up the Azure Data Science Environment

As you can see from the [Plan Your Environment](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/machine-learning-data-science-plan-your-environment/) guide, there are several options to work with the NYC Taxi Trips dataset in Azure:

- Work with the data in Azure blobs then model in Azure Machine Learning
- Load the data into a SQL Server database then model in Azure Machine Learning
- Load the data into HDInsight Hive tables then model in Azure Machine Learning

Please take the following steps to set up your Azure Data Science environment so that you can use Azure HDInsight Hadoop clusters (Hive, more specifically) to process the data:

1. [Create a storage account](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/storage-whatis-account/)

2. [Create an Azure ML workspace](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/machine-learning-create-workspace/)

3. [Provision a Data Science **Windows** Virtual Machine](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/machine-learning-data-science-setup-ipython-notebooks/), which will serve as an IPython Notebook server.

	> [AZURE.NOTE] The sample scripts and IPython notebooks will be downloaded to your Data Science virtual machine during the virtual machine setup process. When the VM post-installation script completes, the samples will be in your VM's Documents library:  
	> - Sample Scripts: `C:\Users\<user_name>\Documents\Data Science Scripts`  
	> - Sample IPython Notebooks: `C:\Users\<user_name>\Documents\IPython Notebooks\DataScienceSamples`  
	> where `<user_name>` is your VM's Windows login name. We will refer to the sample folders as **Sample Scripts** and **Sample IPython Notebooks**.
	> Sample Hive queries are in files with extension .hql in the **Sample Scripts** folder.

4. [Customize Azure HDInsight Hadoop Clusters for Data Science](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/machine-learning-data-science-customize-hadoop-cluster/). This step will create an Azure HDInsight Hadoop cluster with 64-bit Anaconda Python 2.7 installed on all nodes. 

Based on the dataset size, data source location, and the selected Azure target environment, this scenario is similar to [Scenario \#7: Large dataset in local files, target Hive in Azure HDInsight Hadoop clusters](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/machine-learning-data-science-plan-sample-scenarios/#largelocaltohive).

## <a name="getdata"></a>Getting the Data from Public Source

To get the [NYC Taxi Trips](http://www.andresmh.com/nyctaxitrips/) dataset from its public location, you may use any of the methods described in [Move Data to and from Azure Blob Storage](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/machine-learning-data-science-move-azure-blob/) to copy the data to your new virtual machine.

To copy the data using AzCopy:

1. Log in to your virtual machine (VM)

2. Create a new directory in the VM's data disk (Note: Do not use the Temporary Disk which comes with the VM as a Data Disk).

3. In a Command Prompt window, run the following AzCopy commands, replacing <path_to_data_folder> with your data folder created in (2):

		"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Azure\AzCopy\azcopy" /Source:https://getgoing.blob.core.windows.net/nyctaxitrip /Dest:<path_to_data_folder> /S

		"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Azure\AzCopy\azcopy" /Source:https://getgoing.blob.core.windows.net/nyctaxifare /Dest:<path_to_data_folder> /S

	When the AzCopy completes, a total of 24 zipped CSV files (12 for trip\_data and 12 for trip\_fare) should be in the data folder.

	>[AZURE.NOTE] `https://getgoing.blob.core.windows.net/nyctaxitrip` and `Source:https://getgoing.blob.core.windows.net/nyctaxifare` are two public Azure containers that we use to share the unzipped NYC Taxi data with users. Reading from these two public Azure containers does not need access key. 

## <a name="upload"></a>Uploading the Data to the Default Container of Azure HDInsight Hadoop cluster

In a Command Prompt or Windows PowerShell window in your virtual machine, run the following AzCopy command lines, replacing `<path_to_data_folder>` with your data folder you created in the previous section, `<storage account name of Hadoop cluster>`, `<default container of Hadoop cluster>` and `<storage account key>` of the storage account and container you specify when you create the Hadoop cluster. If `nyctaxitripraw` or `nyctaxifareraw` does not exist, it will be created in the container. 

		"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Azure\AzCopy\azcopy" /Source:<path_to_data_folder> /Dest:https://<storage account name of Hadoop cluster>.blob.core.windows.net/<default container of Hadoop cluster>/nyctaxitripraw /DestKey:<storage account key> /S /Pattern:trip_data_*.csv
		
		"C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Azure\AzCopy\azcopy" /Source:<path_to_data_folder> /Dest:https://<storage account name of Hadoop cluster>.blob.core.windows.net/<default container of Hadoop cluster>/nyctaxifareraw /DestKey:<storage account key> /S /Pattern:trip_fare_*.csv

## <a name="#hive-db-tables"></a>Creating Hive Database and Tables Partitioned by Month

Starting from this point in this walk-through, we use IPython Notebook to submit Hive queries and retrieve the query results. If you have created an Azure virtual machine by following the instructions [Setting Up the Azure Data Science Environment](#setup), the example IPython Notebook _**machine-learning-data-science-nyctaxi-hive-walkthrough.ipnb**_ has already been downloaded to your virtual machine in the directory "DataScienceSamples". Otherwise, users can check it out from [Github](https://github.com/Azure/Azure-MachineLearning-DataScience/tree/master/Misc/DataScienceProcess/iPythonNotebooks/machine-learning-data-science-nyctaxi-hive-walkthrough.ipnb). 

The outputs from Hive queries have been read into a Python pandas data frame. Therefore, if applicable, you can directly apply the plot functions provided by Pandas to visualize the results graphically. 

In this article, you will see _hqp\_object_ in almost all Python script sections. _hqp\_object_ is an instance of the class _HiveQueryinPython_, which is defined in the sample IPython Notebook.

## <a name="#explore-hive"></a>Data Exploration and Feature Engineering in Hive and IPython Notebook

With the Hive queries in this exercise, we will:

- View the top 10 records in both tables.
- Explore data distributions of a few fields in varying time windows.
- Investigate data quality of the longitude and latitude fields.
- Generate binary and multiclass classification labels based on the **tip\_amount**.
- Generate features and compute/compare trip distances.
- Join the two tables and extract a random sample that will be used to build models.
- Conduct further data/feature exploration on the 

After you complete data exploration and feature engineering in Hive, and you feel that you are ready to proceed to Azure Machine Learning, you can save the final Hive query to extract and sample the data and copy-paste the query directly into a Reader module in Azure Machine Learning

### Exploration: View the top 10 records in table trip

To quickly understand the data schema and how the data looks like, users can extract top 10 records from each table, run the following two queries one by one in IPython Notebook.

To get the top 10 records in table _trip_:

	hqp_object.queryString = """
    	select * from nyctaxidb.trip where month=1 limit 10;
    	"""
	hqp_object.printResults = True
	results=hqp_object.query_and_retrieve_results()

To get the top 10 records in table _fare_:
	
	hqp_object.queryString = """
    	select * from nyctaxidb.fare where month=1 limit 10;
    	"""
	hqp_object.printResults = True
	results=hqp_object.query_and_retrieve_results()

### Exploration: View the number of records in each of the 12 partitions

	hqp_object.queryString = """
    	select month, count(*) from nyctaxidb.trip group by month;
    	"""
	hqp_object.printResults = True
	results=hqp_object.query_and_retrieve_results()

To visualize the results graphically, run the following Python scripts:

	results.columns = ['month', 'trip_count']
	df = results.copy()
	df.index = df['month']
	df['trip_count'].plot(kind='bar')

![Create workspace][2]

### Exploration: Trip distribution by medallion

This example identifies the medallion (taxi numbers) with more than 100 trips within a given time period. The query would benefit from the partitioned table access since it is conditioned by the partition variable **month**. 

	hqp_object.queryString = """
    	SELECT medallion, COUNT(*) as med_count
		FROM nyctaxidb.fare
		WHERE month<=3
		GROUP BY medallion
		HAVING med_count > 100 
		ORDER BY med_count desc;
    	"""
	hqp_object.printResults = True
	results=hqp_object.query_and_retrieve_results()

### Exploration: Trip distribution by medallion and hack_license

	hqp_object.queryString = """
    	SELECT medallion, hack_license, COUNT(*) as trip_count
	FROM nyctaxidb.fare
	WHERE month=1
	GROUP BY medallion, hack_license
	HAVING trip_count > 100
	ORDER BY trip_count desc;
    	"""
	hqp_object.printResults = True
	results=hqp_object.query_and_retrieve_results()

### Data Quality Assessment: Verify records with invalid longitude and/or latitude

This example investigates if any of the longitude and/or latitude fields either contain an invalid value (radian degrees should be between -90 and 90), or have (0, 0) coordinates.

	hqp_object.queryString = """
    	SELECT COUNT(*) FROM nyctaxidb.trip
    	WHERE month=1
    	AND  (CAST(pickup_longitude AS float) NOT BETWEEN -90 AND 90
    	OR    CAST(pickup_latitude AS float) NOT BETWEEN -90 AND 90
	    OR    CAST(dropoff_longitude AS float) NOT BETWEEN -90 AND 90
	    OR    CAST(dropoff_latitude AS float) NOT BETWEEN -90 AND 90
	    OR    (pickup_longitude = '0' AND pickup_latitude = '0')
	    OR    (dropoff_longitude = '0' AND dropoff_latitude = '0'));
	    """
	hqp_object.printResults = True
	results=hqp_object.query_and_retrieve_results()

### Exploration: Frequencies of tipped and not tipped trips

This example finds the number of trips that were tipped vs. not tipped in a given time period (or in the full dataset if covering the full year). This distribution reflects the binary label distribution to be later used for binary classification modeling.

	hqp_object.queryString = """
	    SELECT tipped, COUNT(*) AS tip_freq 
	    FROM 
	    (
	        SELECT if(tip_amount > 0, 1, 0) as tipped, tip_amount
	        FROM nyctaxidb.fare
	    )tc
	    GROUP BY tipped;
	    """
	hqp_object.printResults = True
	results=hqp_object.query_and_retrieve_results()

Plot the bar chart of the frequencies of tipped and not tipped trips:

	results.columns = ['tipped', 'trip_count']
	df = results.copy()
	df.index = df['tipped']
	df['trip_count'].plot(kind='bar')

![Create workspace][3]

### Exploration: Frequencies of tip ranges

This example computes the distribution of tip ranges in a given time period (or in the full dataset if covering the full year). This is the distribution of the label classes that will be used later for multiclass classification modeling.

	hqp_object.queryString = """
	    SELECT tip_class, COUNT(*) AS tip_freq 
	    FROM 
	    (
	        SELECT if(tip_amount=0, 0, 
	            if(tip_amount>0 and tip_amount<=5, 1, 
	            if(tip_amount>5 and tip_amount<=10, 2, 
	            if(tip_amount>10 and tip_amount<=20, 3, 4)))) as tip_class, tip_amount
	        FROM nyctaxidb.fare
	    )tc
	    GROUP BY tip_class;
	    """
	hqp_object.printResults = True
	results=hqp_object.query_and_retrieve_results()

To view the Hive query output graphically, run the following Python scripts:

	results.columns = ['tip_range', 'trip_count']
	df = results.copy()
	df.index = df['tip_range']
	df['trip_count'].plot(kind='bar')

![Create workspace][4]

### Exploration: Compute Direct Distance and Compare with Trip Distance

This example computes the direct trip distance (in miles). The example limits the results to valid coordinates only using the data quality assessment query covered earlier.

	hqp_object.queryString = """
	    set R=3959;
	    set pi=radians(180);
	    select pickup_longitude, pickup_latitude, dropoff_longitude, dropoff_latitude, trip_distance, trip_time_in_secs,
	        ${hiveconf:R}*2*2*atan((1-sqrt(1-pow(sin((dropoff_latitude-pickup_latitude)
	        *${hiveconf:pi}/180/2),2)-cos(pickup_latitude*${hiveconf:pi}/180)
	        *cos(dropoff_latitude*${hiveconf:pi}/180)*pow(sin((dropoff_longitude-pickup_longitude)*${hiveconf:pi}/180/2),2)))
	        /sqrt(pow(sin((dropoff_latitude-pickup_latitude)*${hiveconf:pi}/180/2),2)

	        from nyctaxi.trip 
	        where month=1 
	            and pickup_longitude between -90 and -30
	            and pickup_latitude between 30 and 90
	            and dropoff_longitude between -90 and -30
	            and dropoff_latitude between 30 and 90
	    """
	hqp_object.printResults = False
	results=hqp_object.query_and_retrieve_results()

To plot the box plots of trip\_distance and direct\_distance, and the scatter plot of these two variables, run the following Python scripts:

	results.columns = ['pickup_longitude', 'pickup_latitude', 'dropoff_longitude', 
                   'dropoff_latitude', 'trip_distance', 'trip_time_in_secs', 'direct_distance']
	df = results.loc[results['trip_distance']<=100] #remove outliers
	df = df.loc[df['direct_distance']<=100] #remove outliers
	plt.scatter(df['direct_distance'], df['trip_distance'])

### Preparing Data for Model Building

The following query joins the **nyctaxidb.trip** and **nyctaxidb.fare** tables, generates a binary classification label **tipped** and a multi-class classification label **tip\_class**. This query can be copied then pasted directly in the [Azure Machine Learning Studio](https://studio.azureml.net) Reader module for direct data ingestion from the **Hive Query** in Azure. This query excludes records with incorrect latitude and/or longitude coordinates.

This query directly applies Hive embedded UDFs to generate some features from Hive records, including the hour, week of year, and weekday (1 stands for Monday, and 7 stands for Sunday) of the field _pickup_datetime_. Users can refer to [LanguageManual UDF](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+UDF) for a complete list of embedded Hive UDFs.

This query also down samples the data to roughly only 1% so that the query results can fit in the Azure Machine Learning Studio.

### Further Data/Feature Exploration in IPython Notebook

After the above query completes in IPython Notebook,  the query output has been read into a pandas data frame _results_. We can then conduct further data/feature exploration on the query output, to investigate the features that are generated, and the relationship between the explanatory and target variables. 

#### Plot the bar chart of the number of trips in each weekday

	 df = results.copy()
	weekday_trip_count = df.groupby('weekday').count()
	print weekday_trip_count['medallion']
	weekday_trip_count['medallion'].plot(kind='bar') #Note: the weekday of Monday is 1

![Create workspace][6]

#### Descriptive statistics of variable _trip\_distance_

	results['trip_distance'].describe()
	
![Create workspace][7]

#### Box plot of variable _trip\_distance_ group by tipped to investigate whether _trip\_distance_ is helpful in differentiating target (tipped)

	df = results.loc[results['trip_distance']<=50] #remove outliers
	df.boxplot(column='trip_distance', by='tipped', return_type='dict')

![Create workspace][8]


#### Box plot of variable _pickup\_week_ group by tip class to investigate whether _pickup\_week_ is helpful in differentiating target (_tip\_class_)

	results.boxplot(column='pickup_week', by='tip_class', return_type='dict')

![Create workspace][9]

#### Box plot of variable _trip\_time\_in\_secs_ group by _tip\_class_ to investigate whether _trip\_time\_in\_secs_ is helpful in differentiating target (_tip\_class_)

	df = results.loc[results['trip_time_in_secs']<=3600] #remove outliers
	df.boxplot(column='trip_time_in_secs', by='tip_class', return_type='dict')

## <a name="mlmodel"></a>Building Models in Azure Machine Learning

We are now ready to proceed to model building and model deployment in [Azure Machine Learning](https://studio.azureml.net). The data is ready for any of the prediction problems identified earlier, namely:

1. Binary classification: To predict whether or not a tip was paid for a trip.

2. Multiclass classification: To predict the range of tip paid, according to the previously defined classes.

3. Regression task: To predict the amount of tip paid for a trip.  

To begin the modeling exercise, log in to your Azure Machine Learning workspace. If you have not yet created a machine learning workspace, see [Create an Azure ML workspace](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/machine-learning-create-workspace/).

1. To get started with Azure Machine Learning, see [What is Azure Machine Learning Studio?](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/machine-learning-what-is-ml-studio/)

2. Log in to [Azure Machine Learning Studio](https://studio.azureml.net).

3. The Studio Home page provides a wealth of information, videos, tutorials, links to the Modules Reference, and other resources. Fore more information about Azure Machine Learning, consult the [Azure Machine Learning Documentation Center](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/services/machine-learning/).

A typical training experiment consists of the following:

1. Create a **+NEW** experiment.
2. Get the data to Azure ML.
3. Pre-process, transform and manipulate the data as needed.
4. Generate features as needed.
5. Split the data into training/validation/testing datasets(or have separate datasets for each).
6. Select one or more machine learning algorithms depending on the learning problem to solve. E.g., binary classification, multiclass classification, regression.
7. Train one or more models using the training dataset.
8. Score the validation dataset using the trained model(s).
9. Evaluate the model(s) to compute the relevant metrics for the learning problem.
10. Fine tune the model(s) and select the best model to deploy.

In this exercise, we have already explored and engineered the data in Hive, and decided on the sample size to ingest in Azure ML. To build one or more of the prediction models we decided:

1. Get the data to Azure ML using the **Reader** module, available in the **Data Input and Output** section. For more information, see the [Reader](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/library/dn784775) module reference page.

	![Create workspace][15]

2. Select **Hive Query** as the **Data source** in the **Properties** panel.

3. Enter the HDInsight Hadoop cluster information as follows. The **Azure storage account name** has to be the storage account that is used to create the HDInsight Hadoop cluster, and **Azure container name** has to be the default container of the Hadoop cluster. 

	![Create workspace][11]

4. In the **Hive database query** edit text area, paste the query which extracts the necessary database fields (including any computed fields such as the labels) and down samples the data to the desired sample size.

An example of a binary classification experiment reading data directly from the Hive Query is in the figure below. Similar experiments can be constructed for multiclass classification and regression problems.

![Create workspace][12]

> [AZURE.IMPORTANT] In the modeling data extraction and sampling query examples provided in previous sections, **all labels for the three modeling exercises are included in the query**. An important (required) step in each of the modeling exercises is to **exclude** the unnecessary labels for the other two problems, and any other **target leaks**. For e.g., when using binary classification, use the label **tipped** and exclude the fields **tip\_class**, **tip\_amount**, and **total\_amount**. The latter are target leaks since they imply the tip paid.

> In this experiment, the first **Metadata Editor** module adds column names to the output data from Reader module. This module is needed since the Reader module which reads data from Hive Query does not create column names for the output data. 
> 
> To exclude unnecessary columns and/or target leaks, you may use the **Project Columns** module or the **Metadta Editor**. For more information, see [Project Columns](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/library/dn784740) and [Metadata Editor](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-US/library/dn784761) reference pages.

## <a name="mldeploy"></a>Deploying Models in Azure Machine Learning

When your model is ready, you can easily deploy it as a web service directly from the experiment. For more information about publishing Azure ML web services, see [Azure Machine Learning API service operations](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/machine-learning-overview-of-azure-ml-process/).

To deploy a new web service, you need to:

1. Create a scoring experiment.
2. Publish the web service.

To create a scoring experiment from a **Finished** training experiment, click **CREATE SCORING EXPERIMENT** in the lower action bar.

![Azure Scoring][13]

Azure Machine Learning will attempt to create a scoring experiment based on the components of the training experiment. In particular, it will:

1. Save the trained model and remove the model training modules.
2. Identify a logical **input port** to represent the expected input data schema.
3. Identify a logical **output port** to represent the expected web service output schema.

When the scoring experiment is created, review it and adjust as needed. A typical adjustment is to replace the input dataset and/or query with one which excludes label fields, as these will not be available when the service is called. It is also a good practice to reduce the size of the input dataset and/or query to a few records, just enough to indicate the input schema. For the output port, it is common to exclude all input fields and only include the **Scored Labels** and **Scored Probabilities** in the output using the **Project Columns** module.

A sample scoring experiment is in the figure below. When ready to publish, click the **PUBLISH WEB SERVICE** button in the lower action bar.

![Create workspace][14]

To recap, in this walkthrough tutorial, you have created an Azure data science environment, worked with a large public dataset all the way from data acquisition to model training and publishing of an Azure Machine Learning web service.
