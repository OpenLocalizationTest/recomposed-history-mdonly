# Refine Mobile Services queries with paging

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-selector-add-paging-data](../includes/mobile-services-selector-add-paging-data.md)]

This topic shows you how to use paging to manage the amount of data returned to your Windows Phone app from Azure Mobile Services. In this tutorial, you will use the **Take** and **Skip** query methods on the client to request specific "pages" of data.

>[AZURE.NOTE]To prevent data overflow in mobile device clients, Mobile Services implements an automatic page limit, which defaults to a maximum of 50 items in a response. By specifying the page size, you can explicitly request up to 1,000 items in the response.

This tutorial builds on the steps and the sample app from the previous tutorial [Add Mobile Services to an existing app](/en-us/documentation/articles/mobile-services-dotnet-backend-windows-phone-get-started-data/). Before you begin this tutorial, you must complete this tutorial.
