## Edit payment information for an existing credit card

Follow these steps to check what payment method you are using and update the details of an existing credit card.

1. Log on to the [Azure Account Center](https://account.windowsazure.com/Subscriptions) as the account administrator. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), you can access the Account Center by selecting **Subscription**>*the subscription name*>**Manage**.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Only the  account administrator has permission to access the Account Center. For more information about account administrator, see [How to add or change Azure administrator roles](billing-add-change-azure-subscription-administrator.md).
   >

2. Under **Click a subscription to view details and usage**, select the subscription that is linked to the credit card.</br> ![selectsub](./media/billing-how-to-change-credit-card/selectsub.png)
3. On the right side of the page, select **Manage payment methods**.</br> ![changesub](./media/billing-how-to-change-credit-card/changesub_new.png)

  You will see the current payment method listed. Select it to verify the information you need.

  **How to update the details of an existing credit card**

  If your credit card gets renewed and the number remains the same, you can simply update the details of the existing credit card, such as expiration date. However, if your credit card number ever changes due to being lost, stolen or expired, you may need to [add a new credit card to your account](#addcard). This is because the CVV security code on the card is changed when the credit card number changes.

4. On the **Manage payment methods** page, select **Edit** next to the credit card number.</br> ![changesub](./media/billing-how-to-change-credit-card/editcard_new.png)
5. On the **Edit** page, verify that you have selected the correct credit card type and card number.
6. Make the changes you need to the card details, and then select **Next** to the **Choose payment method** page.

## Change the credit card that you use to pay an Azure bill

1. Log on to the [Azure Account Center](https://account.windowsazure.com/Subscriptions) as the Account Administrator.
2. Under **Click a subscription to view details and usage**, select the subscription for which you want to update the payment method.
3. On the right side of the page, select **Manage payment methods**.
4. On the **Manage payment methods** page, click **Use Instead** to select the credit card you want to use.

## Removing a credit card from the account
1. Log on to the [Azure Account Center](https://account.windowsazure.com/Subscriptions) as the Account Administrator.
2. Under **Click a subscription to view details and usage**, select the subscription for which you want to update the payment method.

4. On the **Manage payment methods** page, click **Delete** to select the credit card you want to delete.

   > [!NOTE]
