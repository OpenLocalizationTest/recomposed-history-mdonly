# Available services on Azure Germany
Azure Germany is continually expanding the services that are available.  These services are deployed using the same code that is used in global Azure.  This section documents the services that are currently available on Azure Germany, including two key types of information:

* **Variations:** Variations due to features that have not been deployed yet or properties (for example, URLs) that are unique to the German environment.  
* **Considerations:** Germany-specific implementation detail to ensure data stays within your compliance boundary.

Everything else you need to know about these services can be found in their general documentation.

>[!NOTE]
> For the most current list of services, see the [Products by Region](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/services/).

In the following tables, services specified as Resource Manager enabled have resource providers and can be managed using PowerShell. For detailed information on Resource Manager providers, API versions, and schemas, refer to [Resource Manager supported services](../azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-supported-services.md). Services specified as available in the portal can be managed in the [Azure Germany Portal](http://portal.microsoftazure.de/).
