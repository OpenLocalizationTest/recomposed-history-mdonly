# Microsoft Azure Diagnostics


Azure Diagnostics is the capability within Azure that enables the collection of diagnostic data on a deployed application. You can use the diagnostics extension to collect diagnostics data from an Azure Cloud Service Web and Worker Roles, or a Windows virtual machine (VM) running in Azure.

For Web Apps, see [Enable Diagnostics Logging for Web Apps]( https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/web-sites-enable-diagnostic-log/).



## Data you can collect

Azure Diagnostics can collect the following types of data:

Data Source|Description
---|---
Performance counters | Operating System and custom performance counters
Application Logs     | Trace messages written by your application
Windows Event logs   | Information sent to the Windows event logging system
.NET Event Source    | Code writing events using the .NET [EventSource](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/system.diagnostics.tracing.eventsource.aspx) class
IIS Logs             | Information about IIS web sites
Manifest based ETW   | Event Tracing for Windows events generated by any process
Crash dumps          | Information about the state of the process in the event of an application crash
Custom error logs    | Logs created by your application or service
Azure Diagnostic infrastructure logs|Information about Diagnostics itself

The Azure diagnostics extension can transfer this data to an Azure storage account or send it to services like [Application Insights](./application-insights/app-insights-cloudservices.md). You can use the data for debugging and troubleshooting, measuring performance, monitoring resource usage, traffic analysis and capacity planning, and auditing.


## Versioning
See [Azure Diagnostics Versioning History](azure-diagnostics-versioning-history).
