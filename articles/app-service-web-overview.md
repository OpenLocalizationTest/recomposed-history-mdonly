# Web Apps Overview #

## Web Apps in Azure App Service ##

Web Apps in Azure App Service is part of a new paradigm shift, in which we realize that you don’t just build a modern application with a single component, but rather with a suite of various components that are integrated together. To make building applications easier, faster, and cheaper, Azure now gives you App Service. 

Web Apps in Azure App Service focuses on hosting web-enabled content. It is a fully featured managed web hosting platform, which can easily be integrated with any other Azure component. 

## Types of web apps ## 

There are three main types of web apps. The easiest way to get started is by using one of the many CMS templates that are found in our application gallery. Therein you will find popular applications, such as, WordPress, Orchard, Joomla, Umbraco, and many more. If you want to bring your coding expertise to Azure, we offer a plethora of development frameworks, including .NET, Java, Node.js, Python, and PHP. Finally, if you don’t need a web front-end, you can use the managed and scalable platform to run background processing.

## Deployment and management ##

Today’s applications are very complex. To manage this complexity Azure App Service, and specifically Web Apps, offers many options for managing your content. You can deploy your content via Visual Studio integration or FTP, or by all of the most popular versioning tools and services, like Git, GitHub, Mercurial, TFS, and many more. This allows you to quickly and easily push content to the world. 

Versioning and deployment tools are not complete without staging environments, to which you can deploy and test your content updates. Web Apps offers staged deployment and a testing in production platform. These features give you not only the environment to deploy to, but also control of how to ramp up your new content to production and even perform A/B tests.

## Monitoring and troubleshooting ##

As confident as one may be with the latest and greatest version of your content, it is still important to know that Web Apps has the tools you need to monitor and troubleshoot your content. App Insights, New Relic, process explorer and a few other tools help keep you abreast of how well your app is doing. In case something goes wrong, you have access to runtime logs, diagnostics service, and remote debugging. And if all else fails, you can restore your previously backed-up content with the built-in backup and restore functionality.

## Scale in every direction ##

You can scale vertically by simply defining how many parallel instances you want of your application. As your business grows, so does your app. And in case you happen to have one of those businesses that explodes in popularity, Web Apps has auto-scaling. 

You can also scale horizontally with Azure Traffic Manager. You can integrate with Azure CDN to make sure your content is closest to your customers. But, with over 50 Web Apps locations around the world, chances are your application is close to your customers.
 
Web Apps can also help scale your on-premises resources by connecting them to an Azure Virtual Network with a VPN gateway to your on-premises network.

## Shape your application ## 

Depending on your need, whether it is a website or generic compute process, Web Apps can make building your application easier and faster. App Service Web Apps brings true enterprise grade services to your fingertips.
