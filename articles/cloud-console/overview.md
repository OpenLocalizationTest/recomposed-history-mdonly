# About Cloud Console
Azure Cloud Console is an interactive, browser-based command-line interface for managing Azure resources.

## Concepts
- Machine state and files do not persist beyond the active session by default. You may [mount Azure storage to persist files](acc-persisting-storage.md).
- Permissions are set as a regular user
- Console runs on an ephemeral container provided on a per-session, per-user basis
- Console times out after 10 minutes without output activity (Hit enter to reactivate)

## Features
- A browser-based BASH workstation built for Azure
- Automatic authentication
- Bring your own Azure Files for file persistence

Check the full [feature list here](acc-features.md).

## Examples
- Test drive the new Azure CLI 2.0
- Deploy and edit scripts from a browser command line

## Pricing
The Cloud Console is a free service to all Azure customers. Regular storage costs apply if mounting Azure Files.

## Supported browsers
The Cloud Console is recommended for Chrome, Edge, and Safari. 
The console is supported for Chrome, Firefox, Safari, IE, and Edge, but shortcut functionality will be subject to specific browser settings.
