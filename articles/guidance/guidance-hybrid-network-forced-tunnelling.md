# Implementing a secure hybrid network architecture in Azure

![INCLUDE FOR BRANDING]

This article describes best practices for implementing a secure hybrid network the extends your on-premises network to Azure. In this reference architecture, you will learn how to use user defined routes (UDRs) to route incoming traffic on a virtual network to a set of highly available network virtual appliances. These appliances can run different types of security software, such as firewalls, packet inspection, among others. You will also learn how to enable forced tunneling, to have all outgoing traffic to the Internet be routed to your on-premises data center. This architecture uses a connection to your on-premises datacenter using either a [VPN gateway][ra-vpn], or [ExpressRoute][ra-expressroute] connection.

> [AZURE.NOTE] Azure has two different deployment models: [Resource Manager][resource-manager-overview] and classic. This reference architecture uses Resource Manager, which Microsoft recommends for new deployments.

Typical use cases for this architecture include:

- Hybrid applications where workloads run partly on-premises and partly in Azure.

- Infrastructure that requires a more granular control over traffic coming into Azure from an on-premises datacenter.

- Auditing outgoing traffic from the VNet. On-premises components can inspect and log all Internet requests. This is often a regulatory requirement of many commercial systems and can help to prevent public disclosure of private information.

## Architecture diagram

The following diagram highlights the important components in this architecture:

![IaaS: forced-tunnelling](./media/guidance-hybrid-network-forced-tunnelling/figure1.png)

- **On-premises network.** This is a network of computers and devices, connected through a private local-area network running within an organization.

- **Network security appliance (NSA).** This is an on-premises appliance that inspects requests intended for the Internet. All outbound Internet requests are directed through this device.

- **Azure virtual network (VNet).** The VNet hosts the application and other resources running in the cloud.

- **Gateway.** The gateway provides the connectivity between routers in the on-premises network and the VNet.

- **Network virtual appliance (NVA).** An NVA is a generic term for a virtual appliance that might perform tasks such as acting as a firewall, implementing access security, WAN optimization (including network compression), custom routing, or a variety of other operations. The NVA receives requests from the inbound NVA network. The NVA can validate these requests and, if they are acceptable, it can forward them to the Web tier through the outbound NVA subnet.

- **Web tier, business tier, and data tier subnets.** These are subnets hosting the VMs and services that implement an example 3-tier application running in the cloud; see [Implementing a multi-tier architecture on Azure][implementing-a-multi-tier-architecture-on-Azure] for more details. You can deploy an internal load balancer in each tier to improve scalability. The traffic in each subnet may be subject to rules defined by using [Azure Network Security Groups][azure-network-security-group](NSGs) to limit the source of requests and the destinations of any results. In this example, NSGs are also designed to block outbound traffic heading for the Internet from the web and data access tiers (only the business tier is allowed to submit Internet requests).

    > [AZURE.NOTE] This article describes the cloud application as a single entity. See [Implementing a Multi-tier Architecture on Azure][implementing-a-multi-tier-architecture-on-Azure] for detailed information.

- **User-defined routes (UDR).** The gateway subnet contains a UDR that ensures that all application traffic from the on-premises network is routed through the NVAs.

	Additionally, each of the application subnets defines one or more custom (user-defined) routes for redirecting or blocking Internet requests made by VMs running in that subnet. In this example, the UDR for the business tier redirects requests back through the on-premises network for auditing. If the request is permitted, it can be forwarded to the Internet. The UDRs for the web and data access tier prevent outbound Internet requests by discarding them. This technique provides an additional layer of security above those of the NSGs for these tiers.

    > [AZURE.NOTE] Any response received as a result of the request will return directly to the originator in the Business tier subnet and will not pass through on-premises network.

- **Management subnet.** This subnet contains VMs that implement management and monitoring capabilities for the components running in the VNet. The monitoring VM captures log and performance data from the virtual hardware in the cloud. The jump box enables authorized DevOps staff to log in, configure, and manage the network through an external IP address.

## Recommendations

This section provides a list of recommendations based on the essential components required to implement the basic architecture. These recommendations cover:

- The use of resource groups,

- Role-based access control for resource groups,

- Virtual network gateway configuration,

- NVA configuration,

- Defining NSGs and NSG rules,

- Implementing forced tunnelling, and

- Controlling access to the management subnet.

You may have additional or differing requirements from those described here. You can use the items in this section as a starting point for customizing your own system.

### Resource group recommendations

Create each subnet and its resources (including VMs) in a separate resource group. This approach enables you to control access to these resources in each resource group by using [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)][rbac]. Using RBAC enables you to grant varying levels of control over different resource groups to individual members or groups of DevOps staff. For example, staff who can control the gateway subnet could be a different set from the staff that maintain the Web tier, or staff that control access to the business logic or data used by the application.

### RBAC recommendations

within a resource group, create separate RBAC roles for users who can be system administrators (create and administer VMs) and users who can administer the network (assign a public IP address to a network interface, change NSG rules on the network, create VPN connections, and so on). Segregating users across roles in this way allows a the network administrator to change NSG rules and assign public IP addresses to VMs. A system administrator will be unable to perform these tasks, but can manage VMs. To implement this scheme:

- The system administrators role should include the Virtual Machine Contributor role and Storage account contributor role (to enable system administrators to create and attach disks to VMs), as well as the Reader role on the resource group. For example:

    ```powershell
    azure role assignment create -o "Virtual Machine Contributor" -c /subscriptions/nnnnnnnn-nnnn-nnnn-nnnn-nnnnnnnnnnnn/resourceGroups/my-rg --signInName sysadmin@contoso.com

    azure role assignment create -o "Storage Account Contributor" -c /subscriptions/nnnnnnnn-nnnn-nnnn-nnnn-nnnnnnnnnnnn/resourceGroups/my-rg --signInName sysadmin@contoso.com

    azure role assignment create -o "Reader" -c /subscriptions/nnnnnnnn-nnnn-nnnn-nnnn-nnnnnnnnnnnn/resourceGroups/my-rg --signInName sysadmin@contoso.com
    ```

- The network administrators role should include the Network Contributor role and Reader role on the resource group. For example:

    ```powershell
    azure role assignment create -o "Network Contributor" -c /subscriptions/nnnnnnnn-nnnn-nnnn-nnnn-nnnnnnnnnnnn/resourceGroups/my-rg --signInName networkadmin@contoso.com

    azure role assignment create -o "Reader" -c /subscriptions/nnnnnnnn-nnnn-nnnn-nnnn-nnnnnnnnnnnn/resourceGroups/my-rg --signInName sysadmin@contoso.com
    ```

### Virtual network gateway recommendations

Access to the VNet is through a virtual network gateway. You can use an [Azure VPN gateway][guidance-vpn-gateway] or an [Azure ExpressRoute gateway][guidance-expressroute] to connect to the on-premises network. The gateway requires its own subnet named `GatewaySubnet`. Create this subnet with an address range of /27. This address range gives you the space to establish the connection using ExpressRoute. It is recommended to use this range even if you are only currently using a VPN connection as it gives you the flexibility to upgrade later without disrupting the address structure of your network.

Avoid placing the gateway subnet in the middle of the address space. A good practice is to set the address space for the gateway subnet at the upper end of the VNet address space.

### NVA recommendations

The NVA provides protection for traffic arriving from the on-premises network. Route all traffic received from the Azure gateway through the NVA. The Azure Marketplace provides many NVAs available from third-party vendors, including:

- [Barracuda Web Application Firewall][barracuda-waf] and [Barracuda NextGen Firewall][barracuda-nf]

- [Cohesive VNS3 Firewall/Router/VPN][vns3]

- [Fortinet FortiGate-VM][fortinet]

- [SecureSphere Web Application Firewall][securesphere]

- [DenyAll Web Application Firewall][denyall]

You can also create an NVA by using your own custom VMs; this is the approach taken by the sample script and templates that implement this architecture.

The sample script enables IP forwarding for the NICs used by the NVAs to allow traffic intended for the web tier application subnet to be received by the VM through the inbound NVA subnet. If you are creating your own VMs manually, you can use the following command to enable IP forwarding for a NIC:

```powershell
azure network nic set -g <<resource-group>> -n <<nva-inbound-nic-name>> -f true
```

Configure the NVA to inspect all requests intended for the web tier application subnet, and permit traffic to pass through only if it is appropriate to do so. This will most likely involve installing additional services and software on the NVA. The steps for performing this task will vary depending on the NVA and your security requirements.

> [AZURE.NOTE] BY default, the configuration created by the sample script does not set up routing in the NVA. For a simple configuration that you can use for testing, on each NVA VM install the Microsoft Routing and Remote Access Service (RRAS), enable routing, and add a static route for traffic intended for the web tier to network interface *Ethernet 2* (inbound requests arrive on network interface *Ethernet*).

Ensure that inbound traffic cannot bypass the NVA. To do this, add a UDR to the gateway subnet that directs all requests made to the application arriving through the gateway to the NVA. The following example shows a UDR that forces requests intended for the web tier through the NVA:

```powershell
<# Create a new route table: #>
azure network route-table create <<resource-group>> <<route-table-name>> <<location>>

<# Add a route for the web tier application subnet (10.0.3.0/24) to the route table that directs requests through the NVA load balancer: #>
azure network route-table route create -a 10.0.3.0/24 -y VirtualAppliance -p 10.0.1.254 <<resource-group>> <<route-table-name>> <<route-name>>

<# Associate the route table with the gateway subnet: #>
azure network vnet subnet set -r <<route-table-name>> <<resource-group>> <<vnet-name>> GatewaySubnet
```

Always verify that UDR routing operates as expected by using a tool such as [tracert][tracert] to trace the request path from on-premises to VMs in the web tier of the application.

To maximize scalability, create a pool (availability set) of NVA devices and use a load balancer to distribute requests received through the virtual network gateway across this pool. This strategy enables you to quickly start and stop NVAs to maintain performance, according to the load. Point the UDR that directs requests to the NVAs to this load balancer.

### NSG recommendations

The gateway subnet exposes a public IP address for handling the connection to the on-premises network. There is a risk that this endpoint could be used as a point of attack. Additionally, if any of the application tiers are compromised, unauthorized traffic could enter from there as well, enabling an invader to reconfigure your NVA. Create a network security group (NSG) for the inbound NVA subnet and define rules that block all traffic that has not originated from the on-premises network (192.168.0.0/16 in the [Architecture diagram][architecture]). You can create rules similar to these:

```powershell
azure network nsg create <<resource-group>> nva-nsg <<location>>

azure network vnet subnet set --network-security-group-name nva-nsg <<resource-group>> <<vnet-name>> <<inbound-nva-subnet-name>>

azure network nsg rule create --protocol * --source-address-prefix 192.168.0.0/16 --source-port-range * --destination-port-range * --access Allow --priority 100 --direction Inbound <<resource-group>> nva-nsg allow-on-prem

azure network nsg rule create --protocol * --source-address-prefix * --source-port-range * --destination-port-range * --access Deny --priority 120 --direction Inbound <<resource-group>> nva-nsg deny-other-traffic
```

Create NSGs for each application tier subnet with rules to permit or deny access to network traffic, according to the security requirements of the application. NSGs can also provide a second level of protection against inbound traffic bypassing the NVA if the NVA is misconfigured or disabled. For example, the web tier subnet shown in the [Architecture blueprint][architecture] diagram defines an NSG with rules that block all requests other than those for port 80 that have been received from the on-premises network (192.168.0.0/16) or the VNet. The sample script implements this NSG:

```powershell
azure network nsg create <<resource-group>> myapp-web-nsg <<location>>

azure network vnet subnet set --network-security-group-name myapp-web-nsg <<resource-group>> <<vnet-name>> <<vnet-web-tier-subnet-name>>

azure network nsg rule create --protocol * --source-address-prefix 192.168.0.0/16 --source-port-range * --destination-port-range 80 --access Allow --priority 100 --direction Inbound <<resource-group>> myapp-web-nsg on-prem-allow

azure network nsg rule create --protocol * --source-address-prefix 10.0.0.0/16 --source-port-range * --destination-port-range 80 --access Allow --priority 110 --direction Inbound <<resource-group>> myapp-web-nsg vnet-allow

azure network nsg rule create --protocol * --source-address-prefix * --source-port-range * --destination-port-range * --access Deny --priority 130 --direction Inbound <<resource-group>> myapp-web-nsg vnet-deny
```

Similarly, create NSG rules for the other tiers that block all traffic except for that received from specified tiers on specific ports. For example, the  NSG for the business tier subnet in the sample script (10.0.4.0/24) contains rules that block all requests other than those that have been received from the web tier subnet (10.0.3.0/24):

```powershell
azure network nsg create <<resource-group>> myapp-biz-nsg <<location>>

azure network vnet subnet set --network-security-group-name myapp-biz-nsg <<resource-group>> <<vnet-name>> <<vnet-business-tier-subnet-name>>

azure network nsg rule create --protocol * --source-address-prefix 10.0.3.0/24 --source-port-range * --destination-port-range 80 --access Allow --priority 100 --direction Inbound <<resource-group>> myapp-biz-nsg web-allow

azure network nsg rule create --protocol * --source-address-prefix * --source-port-range * --destination-port-range * --access Deny --priority 120 --direction Inbound <<resource-group>> myapp-biz-nsg vnet-deny
```

### Internet access recommendations

Control outbound traffic from the web, business, and data access tiers to prevent accidental disclosure of confidential information. The following UDR could be applied to the web and data access tiers to cause traffic routed to the Internet to be dropped.

```powershell
<# Create a new route table: #>
azure network route-table create <<resource-group>> <<route-table-name>> <<location>>

<# Add a route that traps Internet-bound traffic: #>
azure network route-table route create -a 0.0.0.0/0 -y None <<resource-group>> <<route-table-name>> <<route-name>>

<# Associate the route table with the web tier subnet: #>
azure network vnet subnet set -r <<route-table-name>> <<resource-group>> <<vnet-name>> <<web-tier-subnet-name>>
```

In the sample architecture shown above, the business tier is permitted access to the Internet, but you should ensure that all such traffic is force-tunnelled through the on-premises network (as described in the [Recommendations][recommendations] section) so that it can be audited.

```powershell
<# Create a new route table: #>
azure network route-table create <<resource-group>> <<route-table-name>> <<location>>

<# Add a route that traps Internet-bound traffic: #>
azure network route-table route create -a 0.0.0.0/0 -y VirtualNetworkGateway <<resource-group>> <<route-table-name>> <<route-name>>

<# Associate the route table with the business tier subnet: #>
azure network vnet subnet set -r <<route-table-name>> <<resource-group>> <<vnet-name>> <<business-tier-subnet-name>>
```

Verify that the traffic is tunnelled correctly. If you are using a VPN connection with the Routing and Remote Access Service on an on-premises server, use a tool such as [WireShark][wireshark] on this server to verify that Internet traffic from the VNet is being forwarded through this server.

Configure the on-premises network security appliance to direct force-tunnelled traffic to the Internet. This process will vary according to the device used to implement the appliance. For example, if you are using the Routing and Remote Access Service, you can add a static route as follows:

![IaaS: rras-static-route](./media/guidance-hybrid-network-forced-tunnelling/figure2.png)

> [AZURE.NOTE] For detailed information and examples on implementing forced tunnelling, see [Configure forced tunneling using PowerShell and Azure Resource Manager][azure-forced-tunnelling].

For additional security, you can also control the outbound flow of traffic from a subnet by using NSG rules. The sample script does not enforce this mechanism, but you can prevent the web and data access tiers from sending information directly to the Internet by using NSG rules that block such requests. This gives you an additional layer of security above the UDRs for these tiers:

```powershell
azure network nsg rule create --protocol * --source-address-prefix * --destination-address-prefix Internet --source-port-range * --destination-port-range * --access Allow --priority 100 --direction Outbound <<resource-group>> <<nsg-name>> deny-outbound
```

### Management subnet recommendations

The management subnet comprises servers that contain the management and monitoring software. Only DevOps staff should have access to this subnet.

Do not expose this subnet to the outside world. For example, do not create a public IP address for the Jump box. Instead, only allow DevOps staff access through the gateway from the on-premises network. The NSG for this subnet must enforce this rule.

Do not force DevOps requests through the NVA; the UDR that intercepts application traffic and redirects it to the NVA should not capture traffic for the management subnet. This is to help prevent lockout, where a poorly configured NVA blocks all administrative requests, making it impossible for DevOps staff to reconfigure the system.

## Solution components

The sample solution provided for this architecture consists of a bash script named [azuredeploy.sh][azuredeploy-script] that invokes a set of Azure Resource Manager templates. This is a bash script that you can run on Windows and Linux.

The script assumes that you have an existing on-premises infrastructure, including a VPN server that can support IPSec connections. You must supply the following information to run the script:

- The name of the 3-tier application infrastructure to be created. The script creates separate subnets for the Web tier, business tier, and data tier. Each tier consists of two VMs accessed through a load balancer.

- The subscription of the Azure account to use, as a GUID string. By default, the script creates nine VMs that consume 36 CPU cores although you can customize the installation to use smaller VMs. Make sure that you have sufficient quota available before continuing.

- The shared key used by the VPN server to establish IPSec connections.

- The IP address of the VPN server.

- The address space of the on-premises network, in CIDR format.

The following example shows how to run the script:

```powershell
./azuredeploy.sh myapp nnnnnnnn-nnnn-nnnn-nnnn-nnnnnnnnnnnn mysharedkey123 111.222.33.4 192.168.0.0/24
```

The script creates separate resource groups for the solution, as follows:

- ***myapp*-netwk-rg.** This resource group contains the network elements of the solution: the VNet that holds the subnets for the NVA, the application tiers, and the management subnet; the NSG definitions; the local gateway; the VPN gateway; the gateway public IP address; and the gateway connection.

- ***myapp*-web-subnet-rg.** This resource group contains the VMs for the Web tier grouped into an availability set (the script creates two VMs for each tier, by default), the network interfaces, and the load balancer for this tier.

- ***myapp*-biz-subnet-rg.**. This resource group holds the VMs and resources for the business tier.

- ***myapp*-db-subnet-rg.** This resource group holds the VMs and resources for the data access tier.

- ***myapp*-mgmt-subnet-nva-rg.** This resource group contains the resources used by the NVA and the management subnets. The script creates two VMs and a load balancer for the NVA and a separate VM for the jump box. Each NVA VM has two network interfaces (NICs). The NICs for each NVA VM are configured to permit IP forwarding. No additional software is installed on any of these VMs.

The following sections summarize the templates that create the resources for these resource groups.

### Network resources

The network resources held in the *myapp*-netwk-rg resource group are created by the [azuredeploy.json][azuredeploy] template. This template creates the following NSGs and NSG rules:

- **mgmt-nsg.** This NSG and rule-set is used by the management subnet containing the jump box. The rules in this NSG only permit RDP traffic from the on-premises network and blocks everything else. The elements in the template for these rules look like this:

	```
    {
      "type": "Microsoft.Resources/deployments",
      "apiVersion": "2015-01-01",
      "name": "mgmt-nsg",
      "properties": {
        "mode": "Incremental",
        "templateLink": { "uri": "[variables('nsgTemplate')]" },
        "parameters": {
          "baseName": { "value": "[parameters('baseName')]" },
          "nsgNamePrefix": { "value": "mgmt" },
          "rulesNames": { "value": [ "on-prem-allow", "vnet-deny" ] },
          "rulesDirections": { "value": [ "Inbound", "Inbound" ] },
          "rulesAccess": { "value": [ "Allow", "Deny" ] },
          "rulesSourceAddressPrefixes": { "value": [ "[parameters('onpremNetPrefix')]", "*" ] },
          "rulesSourcePorts": { "value": [ "*", "*" ] },
          "rulesDestinationAddressPrefixes": { "value": [ "*", "*" ] },
          "rulesDestinationPorts": { "value": [ 3389, "*" ] },
          "rulesProtocol": { "value": [ "TCP", "*" ] }
        }
      }
    }
	```

- **web-nsg.** This NSG and rule-set is used by the web tier. The rules permit HTTP traffic from the on-premises network and elsewhere in the virtual network, and RDP requests from the management subnet. All other traffic is blocked:

	```
    {
      "type": "Microsoft.Resources/deployments",
      "apiVersion": "2015-01-01",
      "name": "web-nsg",
      "properties": {
        "mode": "Incremental",
        "templateLink": { "uri": "[variables('nsgTemplate')]" },
        "parameters": {
          "baseName": { "value": "[parameters('baseName')]" },
          "nsgNamePrefix": { "value": "web" },
          "rulesNames": { "value": [ "on-prem-allow", "vnet-allow", "mgmt-rdp-allow", "vnet-deny" ] },
          "rulesDirections": { "value": [ "Inbound", "Inbound", "Inbound", "Inbound" ] },
          "rulesAccess": { "value": [ "Allow", "Allow", "Allow", "Deny" ] },
          "rulesSourceAddressPrefixes": { "value": [ "[parameters('onpremNetPrefix')]", "[parameters('vnetPrefix')]", "[parameters('vnetMgmtSubnetPrefix')]", "*" ] },
          "rulesSourcePorts": { "value": [ "*", "*", "*", "*" ] },
          "rulesDestinationAddressPrefixes": { "value": [ "*", "*", "*", "*" ] },
          "rulesDestinationPorts": { "value": [ 80, 80, 3389, "*", "*" ] },
          "rulesProtocol": { "value": [ "TCP", "TCP", "TCP", "*" ] }
        }
      }
    }
	```

	> [AZURE.NOTE] If you need to allow HTTPS traffic, you can open port 443 to on-premises and virtual network traffic as well.

- **biz-nsg.** This NSG and rule-set allows RDP traffic from the management subnet, and HTTP traffic from the web tier only. All other traffic is blocked. It is defined in the same manner as the previous NSGs.

	> [AZURE.NOTE] If web tier sends requests using protocols other than HTTP, you must add NSG rules that open the necessary ports.

- **db-nsg.** This NSG and rule-set allows RDP traffic from the management subnet, and HTTP traffic from the business tier only. All other traffic is blocked.

	> [AZURE.NOTE] As with the previous example, if the business tier sends requests using protocols other than HTTP, you must add NSG rules that open the necessary ports.

The [azuredeploy.json][azuredeploy] template then creates the VNet containing the following six subnets:

- ***myapp*-mgmt-subnet** for the jump box. The template associates the mgmt-nsg NSG with this subnet.

- ***myapp*-nva-fe-subnet** and ***myapp*-nva-be-subnet**, which represent the front-end (incoming traffic from the on-premises network) and back-end (outbound traffic heading to the web tier) subnets for the NVA. Each NVA has two NICs, one of which is attached to the ***myapp*-nva-fe-subnet** subnet while the other belongs to the ***myapp*-nva-be-subnet** subnet.

- ***myapp*-web-subnet**, ***myapp*-biz-subnet**, and ***myapp*-db-subnet** which are used by the web tier, business tier, and data access tier respectively. The template associates the appropriate NSGs (described above) with each subnet.

The address spaces for the subnets are passed in as parameters to this template. You can change these address spaces by modifying the azuredeploy.sh script. This is described in the [Deploying the sample solution][deploying] section later in this article.


### Application resources

The [azuredeploy.sh][azuredeploy-script] script uses the [bb-ilb-backend-http-https.json][bb-ilb-backend-http-https] template to create the VMs, storage accounts, and resources for the web tier, business tier, and data access tier. The azuredeploy.sh script runs this template three times - once for each tier - passing in tier specific parameters such as the subnet name, the resource group, and the number of VMs to create. This template also takes parameters that specify the type of VM to create (Windows, Linux), the size of VM, the administrator name and password, and the name of the VM:

```
{
  "type": "Microsoft.Resources/deployments",
  "apiVersion": "2015-01-01",
  "name": "[concat(parameters('baseName'),copyindex(1))]",
  "copy": {
    "name": "vmCount",
    "count": "[parameters('numberVMs')]"
  },
  "properties": {
    ...
    },
    "parameters": {
      "baseName": { "value": "[parameters('baseName')]" },
      "vmNamePrefix": { "value": "[concat(parameters('vmNamePrefix'),copyindex(1))]" },
      "vmComputerName": { "value": "[concat(parameters('vmComputerName'),copyindex(1))]" },
      "vmSize": {"value": "[parameters('vmSize')]"},
      "snid": { "value": "[parameters('subnetId')]" },
      "lbBackendPoolId": { "value": "[variables('ilbBEId')]" },
      "osType": { "value": "[parameters('osType')]" },
      "adminUsername": { "value": "[parameters('adminUsername')]" },
      "adminPassword": { "value": "[parameters('adminPassword')]" },
      "stgAccountName": { "value": "[concat(parameters('baseName'),copyindex(1),variables('uniqueString'))]" },
      "vmAvSetName": { "value": "[variables('vmAvailabilitySetName')]" }
    }
  }
}
```

By default, each tier contains two VMs using the Standard_DS3 size (4 CPU cores, 14GB RAM, 28GB local SSD storage, up to 8TB disk storage). You can modify all of these configuration settings - see [Deploying the sample solution][deploying] section for details.

The VMs are created in an availability set, and this template also creates an internal load balancer which distributes requests to port 80 and to port 443 across the set:

```
"loadBalancingRules": [
  {
    "name": "http-rule",
    "properties": {
      "backendAddressPool": { "id": "[variables('ilbBEId')]" },
      "frontendIPConfiguration": { "id": "[variables('lbFEIpConfigId')]" },
      "frontendPort": 80,
      "backendPort": 80,
      "protocol": "Tcp"
    }
  },
  {
    "name": "https-rule",
    "properties": {
      "backendAddressPool": { "id": "[variables('ilbBEId')]" },
      "frontendIPConfiguration": { "id": "[variables('lbFEIpConfigId')]" },
      "frontendPort": 443,
      "backendPort": 443,
      "protocol": "Tcp"
    }
  }
]
```

The load balancer uses a health probe which access port 80 to determine whether a VM is functioning.

```
"probes": [
  {
    "name": "ilb-probe",
    "properties": {
      "port": 80,
      "protocol": "Http",
      "requestPath": "/"
    }
  }
]
```

After creating the resources for the web tier, the [azuredeploy.sh][azuredeploy] script installs Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) or the Apache Web Server on the web tier VMs. The script uses the [ibb-vm-iis.json][ibb-vm-iis] and [ibb-vm-apache.json][ibb-vm-apache] templates to perform the installation. The decision on which web server to set up is based on the operating system installed on the VMs; Windows VMs install IIS whereas Ubuntu VMs install Apache.

> [AZURE.NOTE] The script does not install any software other than the operating system on the VMs in business and data access tiers. You must configure these VMs to match the requirements of your application and install the necessary software yourself.

### NVA and management subnet resources

The [azuredeploy.sh][azuredeploy-script] script creates the resources for the NVA and management subnet by using the [iib-nvas-mgmt.json][iib-nvas-mgmt] template. This template sets up:

- An availability set for the NVA VMs.

- Two NVA VMs (the number is configurable) running Ubuntu. Each NVA VM has two network interfaces; one connected to the *myapp*-nva-fe-subnet and the other attached to the *myapp*-nva-be-subnet. When the template creates the VMs, it configures IP forwarding for these interfaces:

	```
    "parameters": {
      ...
      "nic1IpForwarding": { "value": true },
      "nic2IpForwarding": { "value": true },
      ...
    }
	```
	> [AZURE.NOTE] The VMs themselves are created by another template called [bb-vms-3nics-lbbe.json][bb-vms-3nics-lbbe] using the values specified by these parameters.

- An internal load balancer which distributes HTTP requests sent to ports 80 and 443 across the NVA availability set.

- A UDR that directs traffic to the load balancer:

    ```
    {
      "type": "Microsoft.Network/routeTables",
      "apiVersion": "2016-03-30",
      "location": "[variables('location')]",
      "name": "[variables('udrName')]",
      "properties": {
        "routes": [
          {
            "name": "toFrontEnd",
            "properties": {
              "addressPrefix": "[parameters('feSubnetPrefix')]",
              "nextHopType": "VirtualAppliance",
              "nextHopIpAddress": "[parameters('ilbIpAddress')]"
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
    ```


	This UDR is applied to the Gateway subnet created for the connection to the on-premises network, described in the [Gateway resources][gateway-resources] section. This UDR ensures that all traffic from the on-premises network passes through the NVA.

- A jump box VM running Ubuntu. The template uses the [bb-bb-vm-1nic-static-private-ip.json][bb-vm-1nic-static-private-ip] to create this VM. The VM is placed in the *myapp*-mgmt-subnet.

### Gateway resources

The [azuredeploy.sh][azuredeploy-script] script calls the [bb-vpn-gateway-connection.json][bb-vpn-gateway-connection] template to create the following Azure gateway resources:

- The **GatewaySubnet** subnet. The template invokes further templates, [bb-gatewaysubnet.json][bb-gatewaysubnet] and [bb-gatewaysubnet-udr.json][bb-gatewaysubnet-udr], to actually create the subnet and associate it with the UDR that routes requests to the NVA load balancer described in the previous section. The parameters shown below are passed to these templates:

	```
    "parameters": {
      "vnetName": { "value": "[parameters('vnetName')]" },
      "gatewaySubnetAddressPrefix": { "value": "[parameters('gatewaySubnetAddressPrefix')]" },
      "udrName": { "value": "[parameters('udrName')]" },
      "udrResourceGroup": { "value": "[variables('udrResourceGroupValue')]" },
      "displayName": { "value": "Gateway UDR" }
    }
	```
- A public, dynamic IP address for the gateway:

	```
    {
      "apiVersion": "2016-03-30",
      "type": "Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses",
      "name": "[variables('gwPIPName')]",
      "location": "[variables('location')]",
      "tags": { "displayName": "Gateway PIP" },
      "properties": { "publicIPAllocationMethod": "Dynamic" }
    }
	```

- A virtual network gateway for the VNet using the public IP address:

	```
    {
      "apiVersion": "2016-03-30",
      "type": "Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworkGateways",
      "name": "[variables('gatewayName')]",
      "location": "[variables('location')]",
      ...,
      "tags": { "displayName": "VPN Gateway" },
      "properties": {
        "ipConfigurations": [
          {
            "name": "vnetGatewayConfig",
            "properties": {
              "privateIPAllocationMethod": "Dynamic",
              "subnet": { "id": "[variables('gatewaySubnetRef')]" },
              "publicIPAddress": { "id": "[resourceId('Microsoft.Network/publicIPAddresses', variables('gwPIPName'))]" }
            }
          }
        ],
        "gatewayType": "Vpn",
        "vpnType": "[parameters('vpnType')]",
        "enableBgp": "false"
      }
    }
	```

- A local gateway for the on-premises network:

	```
    {
      "apiVersion": "2016-03-30",
      "type": "Microsoft.Network/localNetworkGateways",
      "name": "[variables('onPremisesLGWName')]",
      "location": "[variables('location')]",
      "tags": { "displayName": "Local gateway for on-premises" },
      "properties": {
        "localNetworkAddressSpace": {
          "addressPrefixes": [ "[parameters('onPremisesAddressSpace')]" ]
        },
        "gatewayIpAddress": "[parameters('onPremisesPIP')]"
      }
    }
	```

- An IPsec VPN connection between the virtual network gateway and the local gateway.

	```
    {
      "apiVersion": "2016-03-30",
      "name": "[variables('vnetOnPremConnName')]",
      "type": "Microsoft.Network/connections",
      "location": "[variables('location')]",
      "tags": { "displayName": "Connection to on-premises" },
      ...,
      "properties": {
        "virtualNetworkGateway1": {
          "id": "[resourceId('Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworkGateways', variables('gatewayName'))]"
        },
        "localNetworkGateway2": {
          "id": "[resourceId('Microsoft.Network/localNetworkGateways', variables('onPremisesLGWName'))]"
        },
        "connectionType": "IPsec",
        "routingWeight": 10,
        "sharedKey": "[parameters('sharedKey')]"
      }
    }
	```

## Deploying the sample solution

To run the [azuredeploy.sh][azuredeploy] script, you must [install the latest version of the Azure CLI][cli-install]. Additionally, if you are using Windows, you must install a tool that provides a bash shell, such as [git for Windows][git-for-windows].

Prior to invoking each template, the script creates an inline JSON object named PARAMETERS which is passed to the template. The template uses the values in this object to determine how to create the resources. Most of the parameters are populated from variables defined in the script. The example below shows how the script runs the azuredeploy.json template:

```
LOCATION=centralus
azure config mode arm
NTWK_RESOURCE_GROUP=${BASE_NAME}-ntwk-rg
# create network
TEMPLATE_URI=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mspnp/blueprints/master/ARMBuildingBlocks/guidance-hybrid-network-secure-vnet/Templates/azuredeploy.json
RESOURCE_GROUP=${NTWK_RESOURCE_GROUP}
ON_PREM_NET_PREFIX=${INPUT_ON_PREMISES_ADDRESS_SPACE}
VNET_PREFIX=10.0.0.0/16
VNET_MGMT_SUBNET_PREFIX=10.0.0.0/24
VNET_NVA_FE_SUBNET_PREFIX=10.0.1.0/24
VNET_NVA_BE_SUBNET_PREFIX=10.0.2.0/24
VNET_WEB_SUBNET_PREFIX=10.0.3.0/24
VNET_BIZ_SUBNET_PREFIX=10.0.4.0/24
VNET_DB_SUBNET_PREFIX=10.0.5.0/24
PARAMETERS="{\"baseName\":{\"value\":\"${BASE_NAME}\"},\"onpremNetPrefix\":{\"value\":\"${ON_PREM_NET_PREFIX}\"},\"vnetPrefix\":{\"value\":\"${VNET_PREFIX}\"},\"vnetMgmtSubnetPrefix\":{\"value\":\"${VNET_MGMT_SUBNET_PREFIX}\"},\"vnetNvaFeSubnetPrefix\":{\"value\":\"${VNET_NVA_FE_SUBNET_PREFIX}\"},\"vnetNvaBeSubnetPrefix\":{\"value\":\"${VNET_NVA_BE_SUBNET_PREFIX}\"},\"vnetWebSubnetPrefix\":{\"value\":\"${VNET_WEB_SUBNET_PREFIX}\"},\"vnetBizSubnetPrefix\":{\"value\":\"${VNET_BIZ_SUBNET_PREFIX}\"},\"vnetDbSubnetPrefix\":{\"value\":\"${VNET_DB_SUBNET_PREFIX}\"}}"
azure group create --name ${RESOURCE_GROUP} --location ${LOCATION} --subscription ${SUBSCRIPTION}
azure group deployment create --template-uri ${TEMPLATE_URI} -g ${RESOURCE_GROUP} -p ${PARAMETERS}
```

You can change these variables before running the script if you need to vary the resources created, for example, if you need to modify the address spaces of the subnets in the VNet.

> [AZURE.NOTE] Change the values of the variables rather than the PARAMETERS object. If you modify the PARAMETERS object directly, or try to add or remove parameters, the template may not run correctly.

The azuredeploy.json template takes the following parameters:

- **LOCATION**. The Azure region in which to create the resource groups used by the system.

- **VNET_PREFIX**. The address space of the VNet to be created.

- **VNET_MGMT_SUBNET_PREFIX**. The address space of the management subnet. This subnet holds the jump box.

- **VNET_NVA_FE_SUBNET_PREFIX**. The address space exposed to the on-premises network for accessing the NVAs.

- **VNET_NVA_BE_SUBNET_PREFIX**. The address space used by the NVAs for forwarding requests to the web tier.

- **VNET_WEB_SUBNET_PREFIX**, **VNET_BIZ_SUBNET_PREFIX**, and **VNET_DB_SUBNET_PREFIX**. The address spaces of the web tier, business tier, and data access tier.

Note that the subnet address spaces must be valid within the address space of the VNet.

The following variables specify the IP addresses used by the templates when they create the VMs and other resources for each subnet. You must ensure that the IP address for each tier specifies a valid value for the corresponding subnet listed above:

- **MGMT_JUMPBOX_IP_ADDRESS**. This is the IP address of the jump box. It must lie within the address space specified by the VNET_MGMT_SUBNET_PREFIX variable.

- **NVA_FE_ILB_IP_ADDRESS** This is the IP address of the load balancer in front of the NVA VMs. It must lie within the address space specified by the VNET_NVA_FE_SUBNET_PREFIX variable.

- **WEB_ILB_IP_ADDRESS** This is the IP address of the load balancer in front of the web tier VMs. It must lie within the address space specified by the VNET_NVA_WEB_SUBNET_PREFIX variable.

- **BIZ_ILB_IP_ADDRESS**. This is the IP address of the load balancer in front of the business tier VMs. It must lie within the address space specified by the VNET_NVA_BIZ_SUBNET_PREFIX variable.

- **DB_ILB_IP_ADDRESS**. This is the IP address of the load balancer in front of the data access tier VMs. It must lie within the address space specified by the VNET_DB_WEB_SUBNET_PREFIX variable.

- **VNET_GATEWAY_SUBNET_ADDRESS_PREFIX**. This is the address space to be used by the VPN gateway. To allow for future expansion, it should provide up to 32 addresses (/27). It is good practice to position this address space at the top of the available address space for the VNet.

The [bb-ilb-backend-http-https.json][bb-ilb-backend-http-https] template creates the VMs and resources for each application tier. The script runs this template once for each tier. This template accepts these parameters:

- **ADMIN_USER_NAME**. The name of the admin account on the VMs. This can vary between tiers.

- **ADMIN_PASSWORD**. The password for the admin account. This can vary between tiers.

- **OS_TYPE**. The operating system to install on the VMs. This can be Windows or UBUNTU. The operating system can be different on each tier.

- **NUMBER_VMS**. The number of VMs to create in the availability set for this tier. Each tier can have a different number of VMs.

The script calls the [ibb-nvas-mgmt.json][ibb-nvas-mgmt] template to create the NVAs, load balancer, and jump box. You can set the following parameters:

- **ADMIN_USER_NAME**. The name of the admin account on the VMs. This can vary between tiers.

- **ADMIN_PASSWORD**. The password for the admin account. This can vary between tiers.

- **VM_SIZE**. The size of the VMs. The default is Standard_DS3.

You should not change the parameters to the [bb-vpn-gateway-connection.json][bb-vpn-gateway-connection] template. This template depends on the values specified elsewhere in the script, so changing the parameters may cause this template to fail.

## Availability

If you are using Azure ExpressRoute to provide the connectivity between the VNet and the on-premises network, [configure a VPN gateway to provide failover][vpn-failover] if the ExpressRoute connection becomes unavailable.

For specific information on maintaining availability for VPN and ExpressRoute connections, see the articles [Implementing a Hybrid Network Architecture with Azure and On-premises VPN][guidance-vpn-gateway] and [Implementing a hybrid network architecture with Azure ExpressRoute][guidance-expressroute].

## Security

This architecture applies security at several points. The recommendations and solution components listed earlier describe the basic solution which you can customize according to your own requirements. However, you should bear in mind the points described in the following sections.

> [AZURE.NOTE] For more extensive information, examples, and scenarios about managing network security with Azure, see [Microsoft cloud services and network security][clouds-services-network-security]. For detailed information about protecting resources in the cloud, see [Getting started with Microsoft Azure security][getting-started-with-azure-security]. For additional details on addressing security concerns across an Azure gateway connection, see [Implementing a Hybrid Network Architecture with Azure and On-premises VPN][guidance-vpn-gateway] and [Implementing a hybrid network architecture with Azure ExpressRoute][guidance-expressroute].

### Routing through the NVA

In the example shown in the diagram in the [Architecture diagram][architecture], all requests for the application are directed through the NVA by using a UDR that routes them through the NVA. This UDR is applied to the gateway subnet. You can add more routes to the UDR, but ensure that you do not inadvertently create routes that enable application requests to bypass the NVA or that block administrative traffic intended for the management subnet.

### Blocking/passing traffic to the application tiers

The example architecture uses NSG rules in the business tier to block all traffic that has not originated from the web tier. The data access tier uses NSG rules to block requests that have not been sent by the business tier. If necessary, you can modify these constraints, but be aware of the security concerns of doing so. For example, consider whether it is wise to allow direct access from the on-premises network to the data access tier as this could allow a user to modify data in an uncontrolled manner, possibly bypassing any security constraints implemented by the web or business tiers.

### DevOps access

DevOps staff access the system through the jump box in the management subnet. You can control the operations that they can perform on each of the tiers by using [RBAC][rbac]; see [RBAC recommendations][rbac-recommendations] for details. Assign roles to DevOps staff carefully, and only grant the necessary privileges. If possible, audit all administrative operations to keep a record of how the configuration has changed over time (and who changed it), and to enable any configuration changes to be undone if necessary.

Apply NSG rules to to the management subnet to limit the sources of traffic that can gain access. Only permit requests that have originated from the on-premises network.

## Scalability

Implement a pool of NVA devices (using an availability set), and use a load balancer to direct requests from the on-premises network to this pool. This will help to prevent the NVA becoming a bottleneck and improve scalability, although this strategy might not be effective to handle unexpected bursts. Monitor the throughput of the NVA devices over time, and be prepared to add further NVA devices to the pool if the workload shows an increasing trend. Adopt the same strategy for each of the subnets holding the application tiers.

If you are creating a custom NVA incorporating your own code, make sure that any security checks performed are stateless and do not depend on the same client revisiting the same NVA for each request.

> [AZURE.NOTE] The articles [Implementing a Hybrid Network Architecture with Azure and On-premises VPN][guidance-vpn-gateway] and [Implementing a hybrid network architecture with Azure ExpressRoute][guidance-expressroute] describe issues surrounding the scalability of Azure gateways. ExpressRoute provides a much higher network bandwidth and lower latency than a VPN connection, but the cost is higher and the configuration effort greater.

## Monitoring

Use the resources in the management subnet to connect to the VMs in the system and perform monitoring. The example in the [Architecture blueprint][architecture] section depicts a jump box which provides access to DevOps staff, and a separate monitoring server. Depending on the size of the network, the jump box and monitoring server could be combined into a single machine, or monitoring functions could be spread across several VMs.

If each tier in the system is protected by using NSG rules, it may also be necessary to open port 3389 (for RDP access), port 22 (for SSH access), or any other ports used by management and monitoring tools to enable requests from the data management subnet.

If you are using ExpressRoute to provide the connectivity between your on-premises datacenter and Azure, use the [Azure Connectivity Toolkit (AzureCT)][azurect] to monitor and troubleshoot connection issues.

> [AZURE.NOTE] You can find additional information specifically aimed at monitoring and managing VPN and ExpressRoute connections in the articles The articles [Implementing a Hybrid Network Architecture with Azure and On-premises VPN][guidance-vpn-gateway] and [Implementing a hybrid network architecture with Azure ExpressRoute][guidance-expressroute].

## Troubleshooting

**TBD - Logging on NVAs, Manual troubleshooting from jump box - testing connectivity, netstat and wireshark**

> [AZURE.NOTE] You can find specific information about troubleshooting VPN and ExpressRoute connections in the articles [Implementing a Hybrid Network Architecture with Azure and On-premises VPN][guidance-vpn-gateway] and [Implementing a hybrid network architecture with Azure ExpressRoute][guidance-expressroute].
