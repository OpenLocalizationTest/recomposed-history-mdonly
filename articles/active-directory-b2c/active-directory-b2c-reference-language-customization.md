# Azure Active Directory B2C: Using language customization
Language customization allows you to change your login experience to a different language to suit your customer needs.  Even if your experience is only provided for a single language, you can customize any text on the pages to suit your needs.  

## How does Language customization work?
Language customization allows you to select which languages your login experience is available in.  Once the feature is enabled, you can provide the Open ID Connect (OIDC) parameter, ui_locales, from your application.  When you call into Azure AD B2C and we translate your page to the locale that you have indicated.  This type of configuration gives you complete control over what languages your login experience is shown in and ignore the language settings of the customer's browser.  Alternatively, you may not need that level of control over what languages your customer see.  If you don't provide a ui_locales parameter, the customer's experience is dictated by their browser's settings.  You can still control which languages your login experience is translated to by adding it as a supported language.  If a customer's browser is set to show a language you don't want to support, then the language you selected as a default is shown instead.

>If you are using custom user attributes, you need to provide your own translations.  See '[Customize your strings]()' for details.

## Add Microsoft provided default translations to your login experience 
By enabling 'Language customization' on a policy, you can now control the language of the login experience by adding the ui_locales parameter.
1. [Follow these steps to navigate to the B2C features blade on the Azure portal.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/active-directory-b2c-app-registration#navigate-to-the-b2c-features-blade)
2. Navigate to a policy that you want to enable for translations.
3. Click 'Language customization'.
4. Please read the warning carfully.  Once enabled, you cannot turn this feature.
5. Turn on the feature and click OK.
6. Save your policy on the upper left corner of your 'Edit policy' blade.

## Select which languages your login experience supports 
Create a list of allowed languages for your login experience to be translated in when the ui_locales parameter is not provided.
1. Ensure your policy has 'Language customization' enabled from previous instructions.
2. From your 'Edit policy' blade, select 'Language customization'.
3. You are taken to your 'Supported languages' blade.  From here, you can select 'Add resource'.
4. Select all the languages that you would like to be supported.  
>If a ui_locales parameter is not provided, then the page is translated to the customer's browser language only if it is on this list
>
5. Click Ok at the bottom
6. Close the 'Language customization' blade and save your policy.

## Customize your strings
'Language customization' allows you to customize any string in your login experience.
1. Ensure your policy has 'Language customization' enabled from the previous instructions.
2. From your 'Edit policy' blade, select 'Language customization'.
3. From the left-hand navigation menu, select 'Download content'.
4. Select the page you want to edit.
5. In the dropdown, select the language you want to edit for.
6. Click 'Download'. 

This gives you a JSON file that you can use to start editing your strings.  For the examples below, we assume you are looking in the 'Local account sign-up page' in a 'Sign-up or sign-in policy'.
### Changing any string on the page
1. Open the JSON file downloaded from previous instructions in a JSON editor.
2. Find the element you want to change.  You can do this by finding the `StringId` of the string you are looking for, or look for the `Value` you want to change.
3. Update the `Value` attribute with what you want displayed.
4. Save the file and upload your changes.

### Changing extension attributes
If you are looking to change the string for a custom user attribute, or want to add one to the JSON, it is in the following format:
```JSON
{
  "LocalizedStrings": [
    {
      "ElementType": "ClaimType",
      "ElementId": "extension_<ExtensionAttribute>",
      "StringId": "DisplayName",
      "Value": "<ExtensionAttributeValue>"
    }
    [...]
}
```

Replace <ExtensionAttribute> with the name of your custom user attribute and the <ExtensionAttributeValue> with the new string to be displayed.

### Using `LocalizedCollections`
If you want to provide a set list of values for responses, you need to create a `LocalizedCollections`.  A `LocalizedCollections` is an array of `Name` and `Value` pairs.  The `Name` is what is displayed and the `Value` is what is returned in the claim.  To add a `LocalizedCollections`, it has the following format:

```JSON
{
  "LocalizedStrings": [...],
  "LocalizedCollections": [{
      "ElementType":"ClaimType", 
      "ElementId":"<UserAttribute>",
      "TargetCollection":"Restriction",
      "Items":[
           {
                "Name":"<Response1>",
                "Value":"<Value1>"
           },
           {
                "Name":"<Response2>",
                "Value":"<Value2>"
           }
     ]
  }]
}
```
* `ElementId` is the user attribute that this `LocalizedCollections` is a response to
* `Name` is the value shown to the user
* `Value` is what is returned in the claim when this option is selected

### Upload your changes
1. Once you have completed the changes to your JSON file, navigate back to your B2C tenant.
2. From your 'Edit policy' blade, select 'Language customization'.
3. From the left-hand navigation menu, select 'Upload content'.
4. Select the page you want to upload your changes for.
5. If you want to upload a language that you've previously provided a JSON for, you need to delete it by clicking on the `...` on the right of that language and select 'Delete'.
6. Click 'Add' on the upper left.
7. Select the language of your JSON file.
8. Click the folder button on the right and browse for your JSON file.
9. Click the 'Upload' button on the bottom of the blade.
10. Go back to your 'Edit policy' blade and click 'Save'.

## Additional Information
### Recommendations for 'Language customization'
We recommend only putting in entries to your Language resources for strings you explicitly want to replace.  We enforce a size limit to the file that is compiled out of all your JSON translations.  If your files get too large it impacts the performance of your login experience.
### Page UI customization labels are removed once 'Language customization' is enabled
When you enable 'Language customization', your previous edits for labels using Page UI customization are removed except for custom user attributes.  This change is done to avoid conflicts in where you can edit your strings.  You can continue to change your labels and other strings by uploading language resources in 'Language customization'.

### Microsoft is committed to provide the most up-to-date translations for your use
We will continuously improve translations and keep them in compliance for you.  We will identify bugs and changes in global terminology and make the updates that will work seamlessly in your login experience.
### IDP translations
Currently, we are providing the ui_locales OIDC parameter social logins such as Facebook and Google, but some of them are not using this open source parameter.  We are aware of the issue and are working on a solution that will be available soon.
