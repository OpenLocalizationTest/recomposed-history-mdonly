# Azure Active Directory B2C: UI Customization in a Custom Policy

[!INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-advanced-audience-warning](../../includes/active-directory-b2c-advanced-audience-warning.md)]

After completing this article, you will have a sign-up and sign-in custom policy with your brand and appearance.  Azure AD B2C allows for nearly full control of the HTML and CSS presented to the end user.  When using a custom policy, UI customization is configured in XML instead of using controls in the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, you must complete [Getting started with custom policies](active-directory-b2c-get-started-custom.md).  You should have a working custom policy for sign-up and sign-in with local accounts.

### Confirming your B2C tenant

Because custom policies are still in private preview, confirm that your Azure AD B2C tenant is enabled for custom policy upload:

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), [switch into the context of your Azure AD B2C tenant](active-directory-b2c-navigate-to-b2c-context.md) and open the Azure AD B2C blade.
1. Click **All Policies**.
1. Make sure **Upload Policy** is available.  If the button is disabled, email AADB2CPreview@microsoft.com.

## The page UI customization feature

With the page UI customization feature, you can customize the look and feel of any custom policy.  This enables you to maintain your brand and visual theme consistency when the user navigates between your application and pages served by Azure AD B2C.

Here's how it works: Azure AD B2C runs code in your consumer's browser and uses a modern approach called [Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS)](http://www.w3.org/TR/cors/) to load content from a URL that you specify in a policy. You can specify different URLs for different pages. The code merges UI elements from Azure AD B2C with the content loaded from your URL, and displays the page to your consumer.

Here are the steps required for hosting your content:

1. Click the copy button on this html code snippet.  Notice that it has well-formed HTML5 content.  It has an empty element called `<div id="api"></div>` located somewhere in the `<body>`. This element marks where the Azure AD B2C content is inserted.

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <head>
       <title>Test UI Customization</title>
   </head>
   <body >
       <div id="api"></div>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```

1. Paste the html in a text editor and save the file as `customize-ui.html`

## Create a blob storage account

Let's start by creating a blob storage account.

>[!NOTE]
> In this guide, we use Azure Blob Storage to host our content.  You could also host your content on a webserver, but it is required that you [enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) on your webserver](https://enable-cors.org/server.html).

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. On the Hub menu, select **New** -> **Storage** -> **Storage account**.
1. Enter a unique **name** for your storage account.
1. **Deployment model** can be left as **Resource Manager**.
1. Change **Account Kind** to **Blob storage**.
1. **Performance** can be left as **Standard**.
1. **Replication** can be left as **RA-GRS**.
1. **Access tier** can be left as **Hot**.
1. **Storage service encryption** can be left as **Disabled**.
1. Select a **subscription** for your storage account.
1. Create a new **resource group** or select an existing one.
1. Select the **geographic location** for your storage account.
1. Click **Create** to create the storage account.
1. Wait for the deployment to finish and the storage account blade opens automatically.

## Create a Container

1. Switch to the left-hand tab called **Overview**
1. Click **+ Container**
1. For **Name** type `$root`
1. Set **Access type** to **Blob**
1. Select the new container called `$root`
1. Click **Upload**
1. Click the folder icon next to `Select a file`
1. Browse to `customize-ui.html` that we created in [the earlier section](#the-page-ui-customization-feature)
1. Click **Upload**
1. Select the blob that we uploaded called `customize-ui.html`.
1. Next to the **URL** click the copy button.  Open a browser and ensure you can view the file.  (If it is inaccessible, make sure the container access type is set to blob)

## Configure CORS

Next we configure blob storage for Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).

>[!NOTE]
>Want to try out the UI customization feature by using our sample HTML and CSS content?  We've provided [a simple helper tool](active-directory-b2c-reference-ui-customization-helper-tool.md) that uploads and configures our sample content on your Azure blob storage account.  If you use the tool, skip ahead to [Modify your sign-up or sign-in custom policy](#modify-your-sign-up-or-sign-in-custom-policy)

1. In the storage blade under settings, open **CORS**.
1. Click **+ Add**
1. Set `Allowed origins` to `*`
1. Dropdown `Allowed verbs` and select both `GET` and `OPTIONS`
1. Set `Allowed headers` to `*`
1. Set `Exposed headers` to `*`
1. Set `Maximum age (seconds)` to `200`
1. Click **Add**

## Testing CORS

1. Navigate to http://test-cors.org/ and paste the URL into the `Remote URL` field.
1. Click **Send Request**
1. If you receive an error review [your CORS settings](#configure-cors)

## Modify your sign-up or sign-in custom policy

1. Under the top-level `<TrustFrameworkPolicy>` tag, you should find `<BuildingBlocks>` tag.  Inside the `<BuildingBlocks>` tag, add a new`'ContentDefinitions` tag by copying this example.  Replace `{your_storage_account}` with the name of your storage account.

  ```xml
  <BuildingBlocks>
    <ContentDefinitions>
      <ContentDefinition Id="api.localaccountsignup">
        <LoadUri>https://{your_storage_account}.blob.core.windows.net/customize-ui.html</LoadUri>
      </ContentDefinition>
    </ContentDefinitions>
  </BuildingBlocks>
  ```

## Upload your updated custom policy

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), [switch into the context of your Azure AD B2C tenant](active-directory-b2c-navigate-to-b2c-context.md) and open the Azure AD B2C blade.
1. Click **All Policies**.
1. Click **Upload Policy**
1. Upload `SignUpOrSignin.xml` with the `ContentDefinitions` tag that we added.

## Test the custom policy using "Run Now"

1. Open the **Azure AD B2C Blade** and navigate to **All polices**.
1. Select the custom policy that you uploaded, and click the **Run now** button.
1. You should be able to sign up using an email address.

## Next steps

This [reference guide for UI customization for built-in policies](active-directory-b2c-reference-ui-customization.md) contains additional information about what UI elements can be customized.  There is no difference of UI customization between built-in policies and custom policies.
