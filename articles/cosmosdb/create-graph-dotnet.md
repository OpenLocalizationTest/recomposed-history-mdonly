# Azure Cosmos DB: Create a graph app using .NET and the Graph API

Azure Cosmos DB is Microsoft’s globally distributed multi-model database service. You can quickly create and query document, key/value, and graph databases, all of which benefit from the global distribution and horizontal scale capabilities at the core of Azure Cosmos DB. 

This quick start demonstrates how to create an Azure Cosmos DB account, document database, and collection using the Azure portal. You'll then build and deploy a todo list web app built on the [DocumentDB .NET API](../documentdb/documentdb-sdk-dotnet.md).  

## Prerequisites

If you don’t already have Visual Studio 2017 installed, you can download and use the **free** [Visual Studio 2017 Community Edition](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/). Make sure that you enable **Azure development** during the Visual Studio setup.

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

## Create a database account

[!INCLUDE [cosmosdb-create-dbaccount-graph](../../includes/cosmosdb-create-dbaccount-graph.md)]

## Add a collection

[!INCLUDE [cosmosdb-create-collection](../../includes/cosmosdb-create-collection.md)]

## Add sample data

[!INCLUDE [cosmosdb-create-sample-data](../../includes/cosmosdb-create-sample-data.md)]

## Clone the sample application

Now let's clone a  DocumentDB API app from github, set the connection string, and run it. You'll see how easy it is to work with data programmatically. 

1. Open a git terminal window, such as git bash, and `CD` to a working directory.  

2. Run the following command to clone the sample repository. 

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-cosmos-db-table-dotnet-getting-started.git
    ```

3. Then open the solution file in Visual Studio. 

## Review the code

Let's make a quick review of what's happening in the app. Open the DocumentDBRepository.cs file and you'll find that these lines of code create the DocumentDB resources. 

* The DocumentClient is initialized.

    ```csharp
    client = new DocumentClient(new Uri(ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["endpoint"]), ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["authKey"]);`
    ```

* A new database is created.

    ```csharp
    await client.CreateDatabaseAsync(new Database { Id = DatabaseId });
    ```

* A new collection is created.

    ```csharp
    await client.CreateDocumentCollectionAsync(
        UriFactory.CreateDatabaseUri(DatabaseId),
        new DocumentCollection { Id = CollectionId },
        new RequestOptions { OfferThroughput = 1000 });
    ```

## Update your connection string

Now go back to the Azure portal to get your connection string information and copy it into the app.

1. In the [Azure portal](http://portal.azure.com/), in your Azure Cosmos DB account, in the left navigation click **Keys**. You'll use the copy buttons on the right side of the screen to copy the URI and Primary Key into the web.config file in the next step.

    ![View and copy an access key in the Azure Portal, Keys blade](./media/create-documentdb-dotnet-core/keys.png)

2. In Visual Studio 2017, open the web.config file. 

3. Copy your URI value from the portal (using the copy button) and make it the value of the endpoint key in web.config. 

    `<add key="endpoint" value="FILLME" />`

4. Then copy your PRIMARY KEY value from the portal and make it the value of the authKey in web.confif. 

    `<add key="authKey" value="FILLME" />`

You've now updated your app with all the info it needs to communicate with Azure Cosmos DB. 

## Build and deploy the web app

1. In Visual Studio, right-click on the project in **Solution Explorer** and then click **Manage NuGet Packages**. 

2. In the NuGet **Browse** box, type ***Azure Cosmos DB**.

3. From the results, install the **.NET Client library for Azure Cosmos DB**. This installs the Azure Cosmos DB package as well as all dependencies.

4. Click CTRL + F5 to run the application. Your app displays in your browser. 

5. Click **Create New** in the browser and create a few new tasks in your to-do app.

   ![Todo app with sample data](./media/create-documentdb-dotnet-core/azure-cosmosdb-todo-app-list.png)

You can now go back to Data Explorer and see query, modify, and work with this new data. 

## Review SLAs in the Azure portal

## Clean up resources

If you're not going to continue to use this app, use the following steps to delete all resources created by this quickstart in the Azure portal. If you plan to continue on to work with subsequent quick starts, do not clean up the resources created in this quick start. 

1. From the left-hand menu in the Azure portal, click **Resource groups** and then click the name of the resource you created. 
2. On your resource group page, click **Delete**, type the name of the resource to delete in the text box, and then click **Delete**.

## Next steps

You can now build more complex queries and implement powerful graph traversal logic using Gremlin. Learn more about what you can do in the [Gremlin support](gremlin-support.md) article. And learn more about the Azure Cosmos DB Graph API in [What is the Graph API?](graph-introduction.md)
