# Build a Node.js RESTful API and deploy it to an API app in Azure

[AZURE.INCLUDE [app-service-api-get-started-selector](../../includes/app-service-api-get-started-selector.md)]

This tutorial shows how to create a simple [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) API and deploy it to an [API app](app-service-api-apps-why-best-platform.md) in 
[Azure App Service](../app-service/app-service-value-prop-what-is.md). You can use any operating system that is capable of running Node.js, and you'll do all your work using command line tools such as cmd.exe or bash.

## Prerequisites

1. [Node.js](http://nodejs.org) installed (this sample assumes you have Node.js version 4.2.2)
2. [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed
1. [GitHub](https://github.com/) account
1. Microsoft Azure [free trial account](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/free-trial/)

## Swagger-first API development workflow

[Swagger](http://swagger.io/) is a JSON file format for metadata that describes a RESTful API. Azure App Service has [built-in support for Swagger metadata](app-service-api-metadata.md).

The API development workflow modeled by this tutorial involves designing the API first and using a tool such as the [Swagger editor](http://swagger.io/swagger-editor/) to create the metadata file. Then you use a tool to scaffold server code for the API based on the metadata. 

For this tutorial the first step of designing the API and creating the Swagger file is done. You'll download a sample Swagger metadata for a simple contact list API. Then you'll do the following steps:

* Use Yeoman to scaffold Node.js code for the contact list API.
* Customize the scaffolded code.
* Test the API as it runs locally.
* Create an API app in Azure.
* Deploy your Node.js code to the new API app.
* Test the API as it runs in Azure.

## Get the sample code and set up the development environment

In this section you download the sample code and install the tools you need to scaffold code from a Swagger file. 

1. Open a command line interface that can run Node.js and Git commands.

1. Navigate to a folder you can use for a local Git repository, and clone the [GitHub repository containing the sample code](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/app-service-api-node-contact-list).

		git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/app-service-api-node-contact-list.git

1. Install **yo** and the **generator-swaggerize** NPM modules globally.

		npm install -g yo
		npm install -g generator-swaggerize

## Scaffold Node.js code based on Swagger metadata

In this section you use the Swaggerize command to scaffold server code for the API. The source data for the scaffolded code is in a Swagger metadata file named *api.json*, located in the *start* folder of the repository you cloned.

2. Navigate to the *start* folder, and then execute the `yo swaggerize` command.

	Swaggerize will ask a series of questions.  For **what to call this project**, enter "contactlist", for **path to swagger document**, enter "api.json", and for **Express, Hapi, or Restify** enter "express".

		yo swaggerize

	![Swaggerize Command Line](media/app-service-api-nodejs-api-app/swaggerize-command-line.png)
    
	**Note**: if you encounter an error in this step, the next step explains how to fix it.

	Swaggerize creates an application folder, scaffolds handlers and configuration files, and generates a **package.json** file. The express view engine will be used to generate the Swagger help page.  

3. If the `swaggerize` command fails with an "unexpected token" or "invalid escape sequence" error, correct the cause of the error by editing the generated *package.json* file. In the `regenerate` line under `scripts`, change the back slash that precedes *api.json* to a forward slash, so that the line looks like the following example:

 		"regenerate": "yo swaggerize --only=handlers,models,tests --framework express --apiPath config/api.json"

1. Navigate to the folder that contains the scaffolded code (in this case, the *ContactList* subfolder).

1. Run `npm install`.
	
		npm install
		
2. Install the **jsonpath** NPM module. 

		npm install --save jsonpath
        
    ![Jsonpath Install](media/app-service-api-nodejs-api-app/jsonpath-install.png)

1. Install the **swaggerize-ui** NPM module. 

		npm install --save swaggerize-ui
        
    ![Swaggerize Ui Install](media/app-service-api-nodejs-api-app/swaggerize-ui-install.png)

## Customize the scaffolded code

1. Copy the **lib** folder from the **start** folder into the **ContactList** folder created by the scaffolder. 

1. Replace the code in the **handlers/contacts.js** file with the code below. 

	This code uses the JSON data stored in the **lib/contacts.json** file that is served by **lib/contactRepository.js**. The new contacts.js code shown below will respond to HTTP requests to get all of the contacts and return them as a JSON payload. 

        'use strict';
        
        var repository = require('../lib/contactRepository');
        
        module.exports = {
            get: function contacts_get(req, res) {
                res.json(repository.all())
            }
        };

1. Replace the code in the **handlers/contacts/{id}.js** file with the code below. 

        'use strict';

        var repository = require('../../lib/contactRepository');
        
        module.exports = {
            get: function contacts_get(req, res) {
                res.json(repository.get(req.params['id']));
            }    
        };

1. Replace the code in **server.js** with the code below. 

	The changes made to the server.js file are called out by using comments so you can see the changes being made. 

        'use strict';

        var port = process.env.PORT || 8000; // first change

        var http = require('http');
        var express = require('express');
        var bodyParser = require('body-parser');
        var swaggerize = require('swaggerize-express');
        var swaggerUi = require('swaggerize-ui'); // second change
        var path = require('path');

        var app = express();

        var server = http.createServer(app);

        app.use(bodyParser.json());

        app.use(swaggerize({
            api: path.resolve('./config/api.json'), // third change
            handlers: path.resolve('./handlers'),
            docspath: '/swagger' // fourth change
        }));

        // change four
        app.use('/docs', swaggerUi({
          docs: '/swagger'  
        }));

        server.listen(port, function () { // fifth and final change
        });

## Test with the API running locally

1. Activate the server using the Node.js command-line executable. 

        node server.js

1. When you browse to **http://localhost:8000/contacts** you will see the JSON output of the contact list (or be prompted to download it, depending on your browser). 

    ![All Contacts Api Call](media/app-service-api-nodejs-api-app/all-contacts-api-call.png)

1. When you browse to **http://localhost:8000/contacts/2** you'll see the contact represented by that id value.

    ![Specific Contact Api Call](media/app-service-api-nodejs-api-app/specific-contact-api-call.png)

1. The Swagger JSON data is served via the **/swagger** endpoint:

    ![Contacts Swagger Json](media/app-service-api-nodejs-api-app/contacts-swagger-json.png)

1. The Swagger UI is served via the **/docs** endpoint. In the Swagger UI you can use the rich HTML client features to test out your API.

    ![Swagger Ui](media/app-service-api-nodejs-api-app/swagger-ui.png)

## Create a new API App in the Azure Portal

In this section you'll walk through the process of creating a new, empty API App in Azure. Then in the following section you wire up the app to a Git repository so you can enable continuous delivery of your code changes. 

1. Browse to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com/). 

1. Click **New > Web + Mobile > API App**. 

    ![New API app in portal](media/app-service-api-nodejs-api-app/new-api-app-portal.png)

4. Enter an **App name** that is unique in the *azurewebsites.net* domain, such as NodejsAPIApp plus a number to make it unique. 

	If you enter a name that someone else has already used, you see a red exclamation mark to the right instead of a green check mark, and you need to enter a different name.

	Azure uses this name as the prefix for your API's URL. The complete URL consists of this name plus *.azurewebsites.net*. For example, if the name is `NodejsAPIApp`, the URL is `nodejsapiapp.azurewebsites.net`.

6. In the **Resource Group** drop-down, click **New**, and then in **New resource group name** enter "NodejsAPIAppGroup" or another name if you prefer. 

	A [resource group](../azure-portal/resource-group-portal.md) is a collection of Azure resources such as API apps, databases, VMs, and so forth.	For this tutorial, it's best to create a new resource group because that makes it easy to delete in one step all the Azure resources that you create for the tutorial.

4. Click **App Service plan/Location**, and then click **Create New**.

	![Create App Service plan](./media/app-service-api-nodejs-api-app/newappserviceplan.png)

	In the following steps you create an App Service plan for the new resource group. An App Service plan specifies the compute resources that your API app runs on. For example, if you choose the free tier, your API app runs on shared VMs, while for some paid tiers it runs on dedicated VMs. For information about App Service plans, see [App Service plans overview](../app-service/azure-web-sites-web-hosting-plans-in-depth-overview.md).

5. In the **App Service Plan** blade, enter "NodejsAPIAppPlan" or another name if you prefer.

5. In the **Location** drop-down list, choose the location that is closest to you.

	This setting specifies which Azure datacenter your app will run in. For this tutorial, you can select any region and it won't make a noticeable difference. But for a production app, you want your server to be as close as possible to the clients that are accessing it in order to minimize [latency](http://www.bing.com/search?q=web%20latency%20introduction&qs=n&form=QBRE&pq=web%20latency%20introduction&sc=1-24&sp=-1&sk=&cvid=eefff99dfc864d25a75a83740f1e0090).

5. Click **Pricing tier > View All > F1 Free**.

	For this tutorial, the free pricing tier will provide sufficient performance.

	![Select Free pricing tier](./media/app-service-api-nodejs-api-app/selectfreetier.png)

6. In the **App Service Plan** blade, click **OK**.

7. In the **API App** blade, click **Create**.

## Set up your new API app for Git deployment

In this section of the tutorial you create credentials you'll use for deployment, and a Git repository for the API app in Azure App Service. You'll deploy your code to the API app by pushing commits to this repository in Azure App Service. 

1. After your API app has been created, click **App Services > {your API app}** from the portal home page. 

	The portal displays the **API App** and **Settings** blades.

    ![Portal API app blade](media/app-service-api-nodejs-api-app/portalapiappblade.png)

    ![Portal Settings blade](media/app-service-api-nodejs-api-app/portalsettingsblade.png)

1. In the **Settings** blade, scroll down to the **Publishing** section, and then click **Deployment credentials**.
 
3. In the **Set deployment credentials** blade, enter a user name and password, and then click **Save**.

	You'll use these credentials for publishing your Node.js code to your API app. In the next step you create the Azure Git repository that is associated with your API app.  

    ![Deployment Credentials](media/app-service-api-nodejs-api-app/deployment-credentials.png)

1. In the **Settings** blade, click **Deployment source > Choose Source > Local Git Repository**, then click **OK**.

    ![Create Git Repo](media/app-service-api-nodejs-api-app/create-git-repo.png)

1. Once your Git repository has been created the blade will change and show you your active deployments. Since the repository is new, you have no active deployments in the list. 

    ![No Active Deployments](media/app-service-api-nodejs-api-app/no-active-deployments.png)

1. Copy the Git repository URL. To do this, navigate to the blade for your new API App and look at the **Essentials** section of the blade. You'll see the **Git clone URL** in the **Essentials** section. When you hover over this URL, you'll see an icon on the right that will copy the URL to your clipboard. Click this icon to copy the URL.

    ![Get The Git Url From The Portal](media/app-service-api-nodejs-api-app/get-the-git-url-from-the-portal.png)

    **Note**: You will need the Git clone URL in the next step so make sure to save it somewhere for the moment.

Now that you have a new API App with a Git repository backing it up, you can push code into the repository and utilize the continuous deployment features of Azure to automatically deploy your changes. 

## Deploy your API code to Azure

Using the built-in continuous delivery features Azure App Service provides, you can simply push commits to the Git repository associated with your API app, and Azure will pick up your source code and deploy it to your API app. 

1. Copy the **ContactList** folder created by the swaggerize scaffolder to some other folder. as you'll be creating a new local Git repository for the code. 

2. Open your command line interface.

1. Navigate to the new folder, then execute the following command to create a new local Git repository. 

        git init

     ![New Local Git Repo](media/app-service-api-nodejs-api-app/new-local-git-repo.png)

1. Execute the following command, which will add a Git remote to your local repository. The remote repository will be the one you just created and associated with your API app running in Azure. 

        git remote add azure YOUR_GIT_CLONE_URL_HERE

    **Note**: Replace the string "YOUR_GIT_CLONE_URL_HERE" with your own Git clone URL that you copied earlier. 

1. Execute the two commands below to create a commit that contains all of your code. 

        git add .
        git commit -m "initial revision"

    ![Git Commit Output](media/app-service-api-nodejs-api-app/git-commit-output.png)

1. To push your code to Azure, which will trigger a deployment to your API app, execute the following command. When you're prompted for a password, enter the one that you created earlier in the Azure portal. 

        git push azure master

1. If you navigate back to the **Deployments** blade for your API app, you'll see the deployment is occurring. 

    ![Deployment Happening](media/app-service-api-nodejs-api-app/deployment-happening.png)

    Simultaneously, the Node.js command line will reflect the status of your deployment while it is happening. 

    ![Node Js Deployment Happening](media/app-service-api-nodejs-api-app/node-js-deployment-happening.png)

1. Once the deployment has completed, the **Deployments** blade will reflect the successful deployment of your code changes to your API App. 

## Test with the API running in Azure
 
3. Copy the **URL** in the **Essentials** section of your API App blade. 

    ![Deployment Completed](media/app-service-api-nodejs-api-app/deployment-completed.png)

1. Using a REST API client such as Postman or Fiddler (or your web browser), provide the URL of your contacts API call, which is the `/contacts` endpoint of your API app. 

    **Note:** The URL will be `https://{your API app name}.azurewebsites.net/contacts`

    When you issue a GET request to this endpoint you get the JSON output of your API app.

    ![Postman Hitting Api](media/app-service-api-nodejs-api-app/postman-hitting-api.png)

2. In a browser, go to the `/swagger` endpoint to try out the Swagger UI as it runs in Azure.

Now that you have continuous delivery wired up, you can make code changes and deploy them to Azure simply by pushing commits to your Azure Git repository.

## Next steps

At this point you've successfully created and deployed your first API App using Node.js. The next tutorial in the API Apps getting started series shows how to [consume API apps from JavaScript clients, using CORS](app-service-api-cors-consume-javascript.md).
