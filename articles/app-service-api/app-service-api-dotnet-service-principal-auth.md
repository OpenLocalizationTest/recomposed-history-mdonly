# Service principal authentication for API Apps in Azure App Service

[AZURE.INCLUDE [app-service-api-get-started-selector](../../includes/app-service-api-get-started-selector.md)]

## Overview

This tutorial shows how to use the Authentication and Authorization features of Azure App Service to protect an API app, and how to consume a protected API app on behalf of a service account. A service account is also known as a *service principal*, and authentication using such an account is also known as a *service-to-service* scenario. In this tutorial you protect an API app for a service-to-service scenario, using Azure Active Directory for authentication and consuming the API from a .NET client. 

The tutorial uses ASP.NET Web API for both calling client and called API, but the techniques shown apply also to other languages and frameworks supported by Azure App Service. The client code shown here is standard Azure Active Directory code for getting and passing a bearer token for a service account. No special Azure-only code is required, such as used to be true for handling the Mobile Services Zumo token.

This is the fourth in a series of tutorials that show how to work with API apps in Azure App Service. For information about the series, see the first tutorial, [Get started with API Apps and ASP.NET in Azure App Service](app-service-api-dotnet-get-started.md). For information about authentication and authorization in Azure App Service, see the previous tutorial in the series, [User authentication for API Apps in Azure App Service](app-service-api-dotnet-user-principal-auth.md).

## Other options for service-to-service authentication

If you want to handle a service-to-service scenario without using App Service Authentication and Authorization, such as by using client certificates, see the [Next steps](#next-steps) section. 

## The CompanyUsers.API sample project

In this tutorial you use the sample projects that you downloaded in the [first tutorial in this series](app-service-api-dotnet-get-started.md) and the Azure resources (API app and web app) that you created in the earlier tutorials.

The CompanyUsers.API project is simple Web API project that contains one Get method that returns a hard-coded list of contacts. To demonstrate a service-to-service scenario, the Get method in the ContactsList.API calls the CompanyContacts.API Get method and adds the contacts it gets to whatever it has it in its own data store, then returns the combined list.

Here is the Get method in CompanyUsers.API.

		public async Task<IEnumerable<Contact>> Get()
		{
		    var contacts = new Contact[]{
		                new Contact { Id = 1, EmailAddress = "nancy@contoso.com", Name = "Nancy Davolio"},
		                new Contact { Id = 2, EmailAddress = "alexander@contoso.com", Name = "Alexander Carson"}
		            };
		
		    return contacts;
		}


And here is the Get method in ContactsList.API, showing how it calls CompanyContacts.API and adds the results to what it returns. (Some code is omitted for clarity here.)

		private async Task<IEnumerable<Contact>> GetContacts()
		{
		    var contacts = await _storage.Get(FILENAME);
		
		    var contactsList = contacts.ToList<Contact>();
		    using (var client = CompanyContactsAPIClientWithAuth())
		    {
		        var results = await client.Contacts.GetAsync();
		        foreach (Contact c in results)
		        {
		            contactsList.Add(c);
		        }
		    }
		
		    return contactsList;
		}

The client object for CompanyContacts.API is a modification of the generated API app client code that adds a token to the HTTP request.

		private static CompanyContactsAPI CompanyContactsAPIClientWithAuth()
		{
		    var client = new CompanyContactsAPI(new Uri(ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["CompanyContactsAPIUrl"]));
		    client.HttpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization =
		        new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", ServicePrincipal.GetS2SAccessTokenForProdMSA().AccessToken);
		    return client;
		}

## Create an API app in Azure and deploy the CompanyContacts.API project to it

1. In **Solution Explorer**, right-click the CompanyContacts.API project, and then click **Publish**.

3.  In the **Profile** step of the **Publish Web** wizard, click **Microsoft Azure App Service**.

	![](./media/app-service-api-dotnet-service-principal-auth/selectappservice.png)

4. Sign in to your Azure account if you have not already done so, or refresh your credentials if they're expired.

4. In the App Service dialog box, choose the Azure **Subscription** you want to use, and then click **New**.

	![](./media/app-service-api-dotnet-service-principal-auth/clicknew.png)

3. In the **Hosting** tab of the **Create App Service** dialog box, click **Change Type**, and then click **API App**.

4. Enter an **API App Name** that is unique in the *azurewebsites.net* domain. 

6. In the **Resource Group** drop-down, select the resource group that you have been using for these tutorials.

4. In the **App Service Plan** drop-down, select the plan that you have been using for these tutorials. 

7. Click **Create**.

	![](./media/app-service-api-dotnet-service-principal-auth/createappservice.png)

	Visual Studio creates the API app and creates a publish profile that has all of the required settings for the new API app. 

8. In the **Connection** tab of the **Publish Web** wizard, click **Publish**.

	![](./media/app-service-api-dotnet-service-principal-auth/conntab.png)

	Visual Studio deploys the project to the new API app and opens a browser to the URL of the API app. A "successfully created" page appears in the browser.

9. Close the browser.

## Update the generated client code in the ContactsList.API project

The ContactsList.API project already has the generated client code, but you'll delete it and regenerate it from your own API app.

1. In Visual Studio **Solution Explorer**, in the ContactsList.API project, delete the *CompanyContactsAPI* folder.

2. Right-click the ContactsList.API project, and then click **Add > REST API Client**.

3. In the **Add REST API Client** dialog box, click **Download from Microsoft Azure API App**, and then click **Browse**.

8. In the **App Service** dialog box, expand the resource group that you're using for this tutorial, and then select the API app that you just created

10. Click **OK**.

9. In the **Add REST API Client** dialog box, click **OK**.

	Visual Studio creates a folder named after the API app and generates client classes.

## Update code in ContactsList.API and deploy the project

The code in ContactsList.API that calls CompanyContacts.API is commented out for the earlier tutorials. In this section you uncomment that code and deploy the app.

1. In the ContactsList.API project, open *Controllers/ContactsController.cs*.

2. Near the top of the `ContactsController` class, in the code that uses the generated client class to add an authorization token, replace the class name `CompanyContactsAPI` with the name of the class generated from your API app.

	For example, if your API app is named CompanyContactsAPI3, the code would look like this:

		 private static CompanyContactsAPI3 CompanyContactsAPIClientWithAuth()
		 {
		     var client = new CompanyContactsAPI3(new Uri(ConfigurationManager.AppSettings["CompanyContactsAPIUrl"]));
		     client.HttpClient.DefaultRequestHeaders.Authorization =
		         new AuthenticationHeaderValue("Bearer", ServicePrincipal.GetS2SAccessTokenForProdMSA().AccessToken);
		     return client;
		 }
 
4. In the Get method, uncomment the block of code that uses the client object returned by `CompanyContactsAPIClientWithAuth`.

		using (var client = CompanyContactsAPIClientWithAuth())
		{
		    var results = await client.Contacts.GetAsync();
		    foreach (Contact c in results)
		    {
		        contactsList.Add(c);
		    }
		}

2. Right-click the ContactsList.API project, and click **Publish**.

	The **Publish Web** wizard opens to the publish profile you used earlier.

3. In the **Publish Web** wizard, click **Publish**.

## Set up authentication and authorization in Azure for the new API app

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), navigate to the API App blade of the API app that you created in this tutorial for the CompanyContacts.API project, and then click **Settings**.

2. Find the **Features** section, and then click **Authentication/ Authorization**.

3. In the **Authentication / Authorization** blade, click **On**.

4. In the **Action to take when request is not authenticated** drop-down list, select **Log in with Azure Active Directory**.

5. Under **Authentication Providers**, click **Azure Active Directory**.

6. In the **Azure Active Directory Settings** blade, click **Express**.

	Azure will automatically create an AAD application in your AAD tenant. Make a note of the name of the new AAD application, as you'll select it later when you go to the Azure classic portal to get its client ID.

7. Click **OK**.

10. In the **Authentication / Authorization** blade, click **Save**.
 
11. In the [Azure classic portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com/), go to **Azure Active Directory**.

12. On the **Directory** tab, click your AAD tenant.

14. Click **Applications > Application my company owns**, and then click the check mark.

15. In the list of applications, click the name of the one that Azure created for you when you enabled authentication for your API app.

16. Click **Configure**.

15. At the bottom of the page, click **Manage manifest > Download manifest**, and save the file in a location where you can edit it.

16. In the downloaded manifest file, search for the  `oauth2AllowImplicitFlow` property. Change the value of this property from `false` to `true`, and then save the file.

16. Click **Manage manifest > Upload manifest**, and upload the file that you updated in the preceding step.

17. Keep this page open so you can copy and paste values from it and update values on the page in later steps of the tutorial.

## Update settings in the API app that runs the ContactsList.API project code

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/), navigate to the API app blade for the API app that you deployed the ContactsList.API project to.  This is the calling API app, not the one being called, which you just created in this tutorial).

2. Click **Settings > Application Settings**.

	You'll add some settings here, but you have to get them from another page on the classic Azure portal.

3. In the [classic Azure portal](https://manage.windowsazure.com/), go to the **Configure** tab for the AAD application that you created for the ContactsList.API API app.

5. Under **keys**, select **1 year** from the **Select duration** drop-down list.

6. Click **Save**.

## Next steps

This is the last tutorial in the getting started with API Apps series. This section offers additional suggestions for learning more about how to use API apps.

* Other ways to consume an API app protected by Azure App Service authentication and authorization.

	This article has shown how to protect an API app and call it from code running in another API app. For information about how to call a protected API app from a logic app, see [Using your custom API hosted on App Service with Logic apps](../app-service-logic/app-service-logic-custom-hosted-api.md).

* Other ways to protect an API app for service-to-service scenarios

	As alternatives to App Service authentication and authorization, you can protect an API app by using client certificates or basic authentication. For information about client certificates in Azure, see [How To Configure TLS Mutual Authentication for Web Apps](../app-service-web/app-service-web-configure-tls-mutual-auth.md).
