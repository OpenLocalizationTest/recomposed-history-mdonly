# App Service API Apps - What's changed

At the Connect() event in November 2015, a number of improvements were [announced](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/blog/azure-app-service-updates-november-2015/) to Azure App Service. These improvements include underlying changes to API Apps to better align with Mobile and Web Apps, reduce concept count and improve deployment and runtime performance. Starting November 30, 2015, new API apps you create using the Azure management portal or the latest tooling will reflect these changes. This article describes these changes, as well as how to redeploy existing apps to take advantage of the capabilities.

> [AZURE.NOTE] The initial preview of API Apps supported two primary scenarios: 1) custom APIs for use in Logic Apps or your own clients and 2) Marketplace API (often SaaS connectors) for use in Logic Apps. This article addresses the first scenario, custom APIs. For Marketplace APIs, an improved Logic Apps designer experience and underlying connectivity foundation will be introduced in early 2016. The existing Marketplace APIs remain available in the Logic Apps designer.
