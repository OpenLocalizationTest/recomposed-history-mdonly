# Best practices for new Azure Mobile Engagement programs

## Overview

In 2013, the average mobile device had 27 applications installed. Users typically spent 30 hours per month on their apps. Most of this time was spent on social networking and gaming (around 20 hours). By 2014, the Android market had around 1.5 million applications for users to choose from. The Apple store contained around 1.2 million apps. Mobile app use is still increasing as developers compete in this growing market. 

The average mobile user will install and uninstall apps with high frequency depending on changing interests and in-app experiences. In order to determine the success of an app it becomes vital to know more than just how many users install your app. It's important to know how useful your app is and if that usage trend is changing. The following questions become important:

- Are your users beginning to find your app uninteresting or obsolete? 
- How many users have stopped using your app at all? 
- Are in-app purchases trending upward or downward?
- Are users failing to complete work flows because of issues with the app or lack of interest? 
- Could you keep your app useful and relevant by pushing fresh data your user base? 
- Would this fresh data be the same for all users or focused on user subsets based on behavior in your app? 
 
Answers to questions similar to these could help extend the life and revenue from your app. They can also help you define and retain your user base. 

Media related apps tend to have some of the highest retention among users. One reason for this is they are constantly providing fresh data to users. Early adoption of useful push notifications directed to a user segment tends to have a high impact on app retention. 

The Azure Mobile Engagement program is designed to help you extend the life and retention of your app by providing a method to gather and analyze detailed information on the use of your app. It will help you classify your user base according to behavior, and create focused campaigns for delivering push notifications and app messages to identified user segments. Key performance indicators (KPI) measure how active your users are with different aspects of your app. Azure Mobile Engagement provides the methods you need to determine these KPIs. It helps increase the return on your investment (ROI) by providing the infrastructure you need to increase engagement with your mobile app. 

In order to get the most out of Azure Mobile Engagement, you need to start with a well designed engagement plan. Your plan will help you identify the granular data you will need to segment your users based on behavior and in-app experiences. In order for your plan to be successful, it is a best practice to clearly define the KPI that will measure the objectives of your app. With clear performance indicators defined, you can easily embed the necessary logic in your app to collect fine grained data which you will use to analyze and evaluate your KPIs. This topic is a best practice guide for defining the KPIs that you will use with your engagement plan. 


## Step 1: Define your KPIs to fit the BET model


Correctly defining common KPIs can be a difficult task to complete. Apps designed for different sectors have their own specifics and objectives. This may tend to confuse your approach. To help avoid this, objectives and KPIs should be classified in three main categories: **Business**, **Engagement**, and **Technical**. This is what we call the **BET model**.

A good plan will generally have objectives with the KPIs that measure the successes in each of the following categories.


#### Business KPIs

Business KPIs should be the easiest part to build. You probably already defined these in some form when you planned your mobile app. These KPIs generally help measure revenue and ROI for you app. The following list provides some example Business KPIs that may help guide you while defining your performance indicators:

- Media Business KPIs
	- Number of Ads clicked
	- Number of page visits per user
	- Number of current subscriptions
- Gaming Business KPIs
	- Number of in-app purchases
	- Average revenue per user (ARPU)
	- Time spent per session
	- Days played and current in game level
- E-Commerce Business KPIs
	- Days app used
	- Average revenue per user (ARPU)
	- Average amount in cart during checkout
	- Product category for most views and purchases
- Bank and insurance Business KPIs
	- Number of accounts
	- Features activated
	- Offer pages visited
	- Alerts clicked or activated	   



#### Engagement KPIs

An Engagement KPI is a performance indicator to measure the engagement of your users. Trends in this area help determine the retention of your app. Here are a few example performance indicators for this sector:

- Active users in the last 3 days
- Inactive user count for the last 3 days
- Count of users who have not used the app in 30 days  

Some obvious external factors may influence indicators in this sector. For example, you may consider a mobile device to be with a user at all times. This may or may not be true. A gaming app might tend to have higher usage around holidays when a gamer may play more while off work or out of school.   

Well defined KPIs in this category should help you measure the relationship between your app and your customers.



#### Technical KPIs

Performance indicators in this category help you determine if your app is behaving correctly, hanging, or crashing. These indicators can measure the health of your app and determine usability issues that may prevent users from using the app. Information collected for this category could also contain performance information that would be relevant to marketing teams. The data could also be useful for troubleshooting by IT and support teams to help identify unreported bugs. 
 
Here are some example Technical KPIs:

- Unhandled or handled exception information and count 
- Timestamp for last crash
- Last button clicked or last page visited
- Memory usage of the app
- App frame rate
- OS version that the app is running on
- App version

Define these KPIs to help measure app performance and pinpoint potential bugs. This indicators should help reduce the time you need to deliver a fix for your customers. They could also help you define a user segment who have encountered a particular issues. You can use that user segmentation to create campaigns to deliver notifications regarding available fixes and potential promotions to help recover customer satisfaction. 


#### Playbook Part 1: Create your KPI dashboard


What tha.....

On a mobile marketing strategy, defining your KPIs, first serves a main objective: clearly designed data you need to collect to monitor your app and understand your end-users behavior. Step by step you build a dashboard which contains the below information
1.	What are my KPIs?
2.	What data I need to build this KPI?
3.	Where these data is located on my application (i.e. screen, settings, system…)?
4.	Can I play an Engagement sequence for this KPI?
Look at our Media Playbook Template to find out some example.



## Step 2: Your Engagement Program


A great mobile engagement program should be considered a key component of your app. This should absolutely include a great welcome program that executes for a user during the first days of app usage. This tends to have a very positive affect on engagement and retention of your app. You want to strive to meet or exceed customer expectation driving interest early while the user is still focused on your app. Make sure you present to your customer key value and benefits. 


![](./media/mobile-engagement-new-program-best-practices/unsegmented-push-notifications.png)

Push notifications are the best way to engage early with your users. However, great care should be taken when segmenting users for push notifications. Because once a user feels like they are receiving spam or uninteresting notifications, it can have serious affect. In few clicks, a user may delete your application never to return. The user should be receiving highly personalized in-app value instead of constant commercialization.

Once users are actively engaged, then your engagement program can help drive other aspects of the app.

- **Not following this:** *For instance, having a high stickiness impacts usage and business but it also leverage your rank in the stores. Hence you can get organic download increase too and have a direct cost reduction.*



#### Engagement Sequence


![](./media/mobile-engagement-new-program-best-practices/example-sequence-graph.png)

A global Engagement Program includes different engagement sequences. Each sequence aims to reach several objectives.


####### Life push sequence


The objectives for a Life push sequence are different depending on the lifetime of the user’s engagement with the app. A particular user may be new, inactive, or very active. At different stages of an engagement lifetime, users may benefit from tips and engaging. 

For example a new user may need help getting oriented to an app or benefit from a new user incentive similar to the following the first time they launch the app...

*"Glad to have you onboard! Remember to login to get your 1st month free!"*


####### Behavioral push sequence

The behavioral push sequence aims to increase usage based on user behavior collected for the app.  

For example, a very active user of a fantasy football app might benefit from being engaged with the following push notification...

*"John you are a serious football fan! Log in to our NFL section and win free access to the SuperBowl!"*


####### Alerting push sequence

Users will appreciated relevant news focused on their interests. An alert push sequence enhances engagement by sending alerts based on interests they have clearly shown.

For example, the user of an E-Commerce app may regularly buy a specific brand of coffee which you have captured with a business KPI. The following alert can enhance this user's engagement with the app.
 
*"Hi Wes, One of your favorite brands of coffee will be on sale 25% off the first week of September 2015. We appreciate you as a customer and wanted to make sure you were aware."*

####### Rentention push sequence

This sequence aims to retain users using a repetitive push notification campaigns to help drive a regular habit of engaging with the app. This can help increase app retention if the user enjoys the interactions. 

For example, the user of a sports related app might receive the following push notification weekly based on the user's favorite teams:

*"For a chance to win 200 points, go vote whether the New York Yankees will win their game this week against Toronto Blue Jays!"*


#### The 3W approach


![](./media/mobile-engagement-new-program-best-practices/who-what-when.png)


Mastering the different push sequences will help you engage with end-users. However, you still need to use the 3W approach for personalizing your notifications. The 3W approach should address who, what and when. 

####### Who: The user segment that will receive messages

Pushing notifications to your users should be considered a very sensitive communication channel. Make sure the notifications you aim to send for to a user segment are well scoped to the interests of that user segment. An incorrectly routed notification is very likely to have a negative affect on a user. 

Use a combination of specific technical and behavioral criteria when defining user segments that will receive notifications. A simple example defining a user segment could be similar to the following statement:

"All users who launched the applications for the first time 3 days ago, and have visited the login page twice without actually completing a login".
 
That statement helps identify the data you would need to collect to support the scenario. The requirements are:


**Still trying to make sense of this**

	-	The “first seen”, technical data to get the “3 days ago” (does not require to build a segment).
	-	The activity “Login page” with an occurrence at least 2 (require to build a segment).
	-	An app-info “log-in = false” to know the status (does not require to build a segment).


####### What: The message that you will send


####### When: The timing of your campaign

When is the best time to activate the campaign triggering the push notification? Should it be manually, automatically, from time to time or every day? Determining the right time or frequency can essential to engaging users with the best results. For each engagement sequence and scenario, you must specify when will be the best time to send push notifications. Here are some possible examples:

![](./media/mobile-engagement-new-program-best-practices/campaign-timing-examples.png)

If you are sending many notifications daily, you must take serious consideration that your users may perceive your communications as spam. 

Azure Mobile Engagement provides two ways to help avoid your communications being perceived as spam. First, use fine grain segmentation to ensure you do not target the same users. Additionally, Azure Mobile Engagement provides a “quota” feature. This feature can limit notifications sent for a campaign. For example, setting a default quota to 5 per week will ensure that a user included as part of the campaign user segment receives no more than 5 notifications for that week.

#### Data Types

####### Devices and users

Azure Mobile Engagement identifies users by generating a unique identifier for each device. This identifier is called the device identifier (or deviceid). It is generated in such a way that all applications running on that same device share the same device identifier.

####### Sessions and activities

A session is one instance of the app being run by a user. The session spans from the time the user starts the app, until it stops.

An activity is a logic grouping of a set of things the app during a session. It is usually a particular screen in the app, but it can be anything defined y the logic of the application. At a minimum you should tag each Activity for your app. This will allow you to  understand the user-path.


####### Events

Events are used to report user interaction with the app. They can be instant actions (like sharing content or launching a video. Tagging events will provide you with data collections that show how users interact with the app. 

####### Jobs

Jobs are used to report actions having a duration. Some examples would include:

- Execution of API calls
- Display time of ads
- Background tasks duration 
- Purchase process duration
- Playing a video to the end


####### Errors

Errors are used to report issues detected by the app. For example, incorrect user actions, or API call failures.

####### Application information

Applications information (or App-Info) is used to tag users. It associates some data to the users of an application. For a given key, Azure Mobile Engagement only keeps track of the latest value (no history). App-info reveals the status of your app or your end-users. For example the log-in status, or the favorite product group for a user.

####### Crash data

Crash data automatically collected by the Mobile Engagement SDK to report application failures not handled by the application. For example an unhandled exception that occurs.


####### Extra data

Events, errors, activities and jobs can be enhanced with parameters. This is extra-information in Mobile Engagement used to support gathering dynamic data from the application. This is important to for defining fine-grained segmentation. For instance, a media application may contain extra-info such as “category_news” within an activity. “article” will allow you to segment end-users based on the categories of articles they read. Extra-info always comes with a set of pair key/value. In the example for this media application, the extra-info name should be “category_news” and the value, a string providing the extra information for that category. For example “sports", "economy", or "political".




#### Creating a tag plan


**Still reviewing this for updates**


#### Tag and SDK integration 

The step by step [Engagement SDK Integration](mobile-engagement-windows-store-integrate-engagement.md) documentation on Azure website is the best guide for integrating the Azure Mobile Enagagement SDK. Follow that link and choose your client platform at the top.

For IT teams, we recommend creating a project with two apps built on top of Azure Mobile Engagement. One would be an app for development stage, the other one for production staging. The IT team can make their change on the ‘app test’ and switch on ‘app prod’ when the user acceptance testing is ok .



#### User acceptance testing (UAT)

User acceptance testing (UAT) involves making you sure that everything works as designed. Work flows can be completed and should be gathering your required data based on your tag plan:
 
•	Information tagging should be in place according to documented AZME concepts
•	All information you need is collected (including Extra info value, App info value)
•	Nomenclature is the same that you defined it on your Tag Plan
•	There is no duplicate data

You must test all the types of notification behavior you have embedded:

•	Announcements, Polls, Data pushes out of app and in-app
•	Text/Web views
•	Badge update, Categories



#### Setup

Setting up Azure Mobile Engagement is very simple. All the documentation related to the user interface is available on the Azure Mobile Engagement website: [How to navigate the user interface](mobile-engagement-user-interface-navigation.md).

It is recommended that you start by setting up the right roles and role memberships for the users of your project. This helps you manage proper access to the platform.

- Administrators
- Developers
- Viewers 

Afterwards:
- Register your deviceID to make test on your own devices.
- Go to the settings of your account and set up the time zone to have charts and notification delivery time set for your time zone.
- Go to the settings of your application and register the “App-info” you need to target end-user within Reach.

## Conclusion


You are set to run Azure Mobile Engagement, but it is important to bear in mind that Engagement Programs are iterative and you should improve your as you experiment with what works best for your app. 

Initially, as you developing experience with engagement strategies don't try to build a global engagement strategy. Proceed step by step and identify your KPIs and how to leverage them. 

After you have developed some experience consider the following:

- Tracking:  You acquire users and you probably define data-collection sources. Azure mobile Engagement can be linked to data-collection sources. It allows you to monitor performances of each source. This information will be interesting to maximize your acquisition investment. 

- A/B testing: This is an essential part of Engagement program. Each Database has its own specifics. A/B testing you can improve your Engagement program.

- Geo-location: This is a big opportunity for brands. Thanks to this feature you can reach at the right place and time. We recommend verifying you have gathered enough end-user behavior data before starting to use geo-location.

- Data push: Data push is an invisible push. Data push allows customizing your application based on end-user behavior. For example, a user segment often consults regarding high-tech products. When he launches the app I send a data push, which will personalize his home page with high-tech content.
