# Advanced Reporting with the Windows Universal Apps Engagement SDK

This topic describes additional reporting scenarios in your Windows Universal application. These are options that you can choose to apply to the app created in the [Getting Started](mobile-engagement-windows-store-dotnet-get-started.md) tutorial.

## Prerequisites

[AZURE.INCLUDE [Prereqs](../../includes/mobile-engagement-windows-store-prereqs.md)]

The tutorial you completed was deliberately direct and simple, but there are a number of options you can choose from.

## Install the Mobile Engagement Universal Apps SDK for Windows 8.x and Windows Phone 8.1

NuGet automatically deploys the SDK resources in the `Resources` folder at the root of your application project.

## Initialize the Engagement SDK

### Engagement configuration

The Engagement configuration is centralized in the `Resources\EngagementConfiguration.xml` file of your project, which is where it was specified in the [Getting Started](mobile-engagement-windows-store-dotnet-get-started.md) topic.

But you can also specify it at runtime: you can call the following method before the Engagement agent initialization:

          /* Engagement configuration. */
          EngagementConfiguration engagementConfiguration = new EngagementConfiguration();

          /* Set the Engagement connection string. */
          engagementConfiguration.Agent.ConnectionString = "Endpoint={appCollection}.{domain};AppId={appId};SdkKey={sdkKey}";

          /* Initialize Engagement angent with above configuration. */
          EngagementAgent.Instance.Init(e, engagementConfiguration);



## Basic reporting

### Recommended method: overload your `Page` classes

In order to activate the report of all the logs required by Engagement to compute Users, Sessions, Activities, Crashes and Technical statistics, you can simply make all your `Page` sub-classes inherit from the `EngagementPage` classes.

Here is an example of how to do this for a page of your application. You can do the same thing for all pages of your application.

#### C# Source file

Modify your page `.xaml.cs` file:

-   Add to your `using` statements:

		using Microsoft.Azure.Engagement;

-   Replace `Page` with `EngagementPage`:

**Without Engagement:**

		namespace Example
		{
		  public sealed partial class ExamplePage : Page
		  {
		    [...]
		  }
		}

**With Engagement:**

		using Microsoft.Azure.Engagement;

		namespace Example
		{
		  public sealed partial class ExamplePage : EngagementPage
		  {
		    [...]
		  }
		}

> [AZURE.IMPORTANT] If your page overrides the `OnNavigatedTo` method, be sure to call `base.OnNavigatedTo(e)`. Otherwise,  the activity will not be reported (the `EngagementPage` calls `StartActivity` inside its `OnNavigatedTo` method).

#### XAML file

Modify your page `.xaml` file:

-   Add to your namespaces declarations:

		xmlns:engagement="using:Microsoft.Azure.Engagement"

-   Replace `Page` with `engagement:EngagementPage`:

**Without Engagement:**

		<Page>
		    <!-- layout -->
		    ...
		</Page>

**With Engagement:**

		<engagement:EngagementPage
		    xmlns:engagement="using:Microsoft.Azure.Engagement">
		    <!-- layout -->
		    ...
		</engagement:EngagementPage >

#### Override the default behaviour

By default, the class name of the page is reported as the activity name, with no extra. If the class uses the "Page" suffix, Engagement will also remove it.

If you want to override the default behaviour for the name, simply add this to your code:

		// in the .xaml.cs file
		protected override string GetEngagementPageName()
		{
		  /* your code */
		  return "new name";
		}

If you want to report some extra informations with your activity, you can add this to your code:

		// in the .xaml.cs file
		protected override Dictionary<object,object> GetEngagementPageExtra()
		{
		  /* your code */
		  return extra;
		}

These methods are called from within the `OnNavigatedTo` method of your page.

### Alternate method: call `StartActivity()` manually

If you cannot or do not want to overload your `Page` classes, you can instead start your activities by calling `EngagementAgent` methods directly.

We recommend to call `StartActivity` inside your `OnNavigatedTo` method of your Page.

			protected override void OnNavigatedTo(NavigationEventArgs e)
			{
			  base.OnNavigatedTo(e);
			  EngagementAgent.Instance.StartActivity("MyPage");
			}

> [AZURE.IMPORTANT]  Ensure you end your session correctly.
>
> The Windows Universal SDK automatically calls the `EndActivity` method when the application is closed. Thus, it is **HIGHLY** recommended to call the `StartActivity` method whenever the activity of the user change, and to **NEVER** call the `EndActivity` method, this method sends to Engagement server that current user has leave the application, this will impacts all application logs.

## Advanced reporting

Optionally, you may want to report application specific events, errors and jobs, to do so, use the others methods found in the `EngagementAgent` class. The Engagement API allows to use all of Engagement's advanced capabilities.
