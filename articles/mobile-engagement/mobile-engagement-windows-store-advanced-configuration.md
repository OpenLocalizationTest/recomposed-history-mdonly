This procedure describes how to configure various configuration options for Azure Mobile Engagement Android apps.

## Prerequisites

[AZURE.INCLUDE [Prereqs](../../includes/mobile-engagement-windows-store-prereqs.md)]

##Advanced configuration

### Disable automatic crash reporting

You can disable the automatic crash reporting feature of Engagement. Then, when an unhandled exception will occur, Engagement won't do anything.

> [AZURE.WARNING] If you plan to disable this feature, be aware that when a unhandled crash will occur in your app, Engagement will not send the crash **AND** will not close the session and jobs.

To disable automatic crash reporting, just customize your configuration depending on the way you declared it:

#### From `EngagementConfiguration.xml` file

Set report crash to `false` between `<reportCrash>` and `</reportCrash>` tags.

#### From `EngagementConfiguration` object at run time

Set report crash to false using your EngagementConfiguration object.

		/* Engagement configuration. */
		EngagementConfiguration engagementConfiguration = new EngagementConfiguration();
		engagementConfiguration.Agent.ConnectionString = "Endpoint={appCollection}.{domain};AppId={appId};SdkKey={sdkKey}";

		/* Disable Engagement crash reporting. */
		engagementConfiguration.Agent.ReportCrash = false;

### Disable real time reporting

By default, the Engagement service reports logs in real time. If your application reports logs very frequently, it is better to buffer the logs and to report them all at once on a regular time base (this is called the “burst mode”).

To do so, call the method:

		EngagementAgent.Instance.SetBurstThreshold(int everyMs);

The argument is a value in **milliseconds**. At any time, if you want to reactivate the real-time logging, just call the method without any parameter, or with the 0 value.

The burst mode slightly increase the battery life but has an impact on the Engagement Monitor: all sessions and jobs duration will be rounded to the burst threshold (thus, sessions and jobs shorter than the burst threshold may not be visible). It is recommended to use a burst threshold no longer than 30000 (30s). You have to be aware that saved logs are limited to 300 items. If sending is too long you can lose some logs.

> [AZURE.WARNING] The burst threshold cannot be configured to a period lesser than 1s. If you try to do so, the SDK will show a trace with the error and will automatically reset to the default value, i.e., 0s. This will trigger the SDK to report the logs in real-time.
