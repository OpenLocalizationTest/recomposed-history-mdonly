# Overview of autoscale in Microsoft Azure Virtual Machines, Cloud Services, and Web Apps

This article describes what Microsoft Azure autoscaling is, its benefits, and starts you on the path to using it. 

Azure Insights autoscaling applies only to 

* [Virtual Machine Scale Sets](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/virtual-machine-scale-sets/)
* [Cloud Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cloud-services/)
* [App Service - Web Apps](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/app-service/web/) 
  
   
>[AZURE.NOTE] Azure has two autoscaling methods. An older version of autoscaling applies to Virtual Machines (availability sets). This feature has limited support and we recommend migrating to VM Scale Sets for faster and more reliable autoscaling support. A link on how to use the older technology is included in this article.  


## What is autoscaling 

Autoscaling allows you to have the right amount of resources running to handle the load on your application without wasting money due to resources sitting idle. It allows you to add or remove compute resources automatically based on a set of rules. Figure 1 shows this concept.

**Figure 1: Autoscaling concept explained**

Autoscaling only scales horizontally, which is an increase ("out") or decrease ("in") in the number of VM instances.  Horizontal scaling is more flexible in a cloud situation as it allows you to run potentially thousands of VMs to handle load. The other type of scaling is vertical. Vertical scaling keeps the same number of VMs, but makes the VM more ("up") or less ("down") powerful. Power is measured in memory, CPU speed, disk space, etc.  Vertical scaling has more limitations. It's dependent on the availability of larger hardware, which can vary by region and quickly hits and upper limit. Vertical scaling also usually requires a VM stop and start. For more information, see [Vertically scale Azure virtual machine with Azure Automation](../virtual-machines/virtual-machines-linux-vertical-scaling-automation.md) 


Autoscaling requires you to create rules about when to scale resources out or in. Criteria you can set to control scale actions include 

* **Minimum** and **maximum** number of instances to run. A minimum to make sure your application is always running and a maximum to control your costs.
* **Rule or condition** for autoscaling. It can be a metric or schedule based scaling. 
* **Cool down time**, which is the amount of time to wait after an autoscale event before allowing another autoscale event to occur. This period of time is to protect against a state called "flapping", which occurs when VMs are rapidly added and removed over minutes of time. There is a cost start or stop a VM. Flapping doesn't save cost and the VM being started and stopped can't do any useful processing, so it's worse than just leaving the VM running.    

   
The full list of configurable values is available in the [Autoscale REST API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn931928.aspx)

## Resource Metrics 
Resources emit metrics, which are later processed by rules. Metrics come via different methods.
VM Scale Sets uses telemetry data from Azure diagnostics agents whereas telemetry for Web apps and Cloud services comes directly from the Azure Infrastructure. Some commonly used statistics include CPU Usage, memory usage, thread counts, queue length, and disk usage. For a list of what telemetry data you can use, see [Autoscale Common Metrics](insights-autoscale-common-metrics.md). 

Â 
## Time
Schedule-based rules are based on UTC. You must set your time zone properly when setting up your rules.  

## Autoscale Rules
The diagram shows only one autoscale rule, but you can have many of them. You can create complex overlapping rules as needed for your situation.  Rule types include  
 
 - **Metric-based** - For example, do this action when CPU usage is above 50%. 
 - **Time-based** - For example, trigger a webhook every 8am on Saturday in a given time zone.

 
## Autoscale Actions and Automation

Rules can trigger one or more types of actions.

- **Scale** - Scale VMs in or out
- **Email** - Send email to admins and co-admins of a subscription, and to additional email address you specify
- **Automate via webhooks** - Call webhooks, which can trigger multiple complex actions inside or outside Azure. Inside Azure, you can start an Azure Automation runbook, Azure Function, or Azure Logic App. Example 3rd party URL outside Azure include services like Slack and Twilio. 


## Resource Manager Rules Details

Autoscaling rules have the following structure in an Azure Resource Manager template. 

![Azure Resource Manager Autoscale Rule Structure](./media/monitoring-autoscale-overview/AzureResourceManagerRuleStructure2.png)

You can list multiple profiles. Each profile can have multiple rules. Notification methods and locations are included after your profiles. Notification examples include a webhook with the URI, or emails with the email addresses.

For code examples, see

* [Autoscaling REST API](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dn931953.aspx) 

## Methods of Access 
You can set up autoscale rules via 

- Azure Portal
- PowerShell 
- Common Library Interface (CLI)
- Insights REST API
