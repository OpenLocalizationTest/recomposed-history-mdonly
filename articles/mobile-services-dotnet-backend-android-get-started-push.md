This topic shows how to use Azure Mobile Services to send push notifications to your Android app. In this tutorial you add push notifications using Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) to the quickstart project. When complete, your mobile service will send a push notification each time a record is inserted. 

The mobile service that you create in this tutorial supports the .NET runtime in the Mobile Service. This allows you to use .NET languages and Visual Studio for server-side business logic in the mobile service. To create a mobile service that lets you write your server-side business logic in JavaScript, see the [JavaScript backend version] of this topic.

[WACOM.NOTE]This tutorial demonstrates Mobile Services integration with Notification Hubs, which is currently in preview. 

<div class="dev-callout"><b>Note</b>
<p>This tutorial requires Visual Studio 2013.</p>
</div>

This tutorial walks you through these basic steps:

1. [Enable Google Cloud Messaging](#register)
2. [Configure mobile service to send push requests](#configure)
3. [Download the service locally]
4. [Test the mobile service]
5. [Update the server to send push notifications](#update-server)
6. [Publish the mobile service to Azure]
7. [Add push notifications to your app](#update)
8. [Test the app against the published mobile service]


This tutorial is based on the Mobile Services quickstart. Before you start this tutorial, you must first complete either [Get started with Mobile Services] or [Get started with data] to connect your project to the mobile service. 

<div class="dev-callout"><strong>Note</strong> <p>To complete this tutorial, you need an Azure account. If you don't have an account, you can create a free trial account in just a couple of minutes. For details, see <a href="http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial/?WT.mc_id=AE564AB28&amp;returnurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.windowsazure.com%2Fen-us%2Fdocumentation%2Farticles%2Fmobile-services-dotnet-backend-windows-store-dotnet-get-started-data%2F" target="_blank">Azure Free Trial</a>.</p></div> 


##<a id="register"></a>Enable Google Cloud Messaging

[WACOM.INCLUDE [Enable GCM](../includes/mobile-services-enable-Google-cloud-messaging.md)]


##<a id="configure"></a>Configure Mobile Services to send push requests

1. Log on to the [Windows Azure Management Portal], click **Mobile Services**, and then click your app.

   	![](./media/mobile-services-android-get-started-push/mobile-services-selection.png)

2. Click the **Push** tab, and enter the **API Key** value obtained from GCM in the previous procedure, and then click **Save**.

   	![](./media/mobile-services-android-get-started-push/mobile-push-tab-android.png)

    <div class="dev-callout"><b>Important</b>
	<p>When you set your GCM credentials for enhanced push notifications in the Push tab in the portal, they are shared with Notification Hubs to configure the notification hub with your app.</p>
    </div>


Your mobile service is now configured to work with GCM and Notification Hubs.

###Verify Android SDK Version

[WACOM.INCLUDE [mobile-services-verify-android-sdk-version](../includes/mobile-services-verify-android-sdk-version.md)]


Your next step is to install Google Play services. Google Cloud Messaging has some minimum API level requirements for development and testing, which the **minSdkVersion** property in the Manifest must conform to. 

If you will be testing with an older device, then consult [Set Up Google Play Services SDK] to determine how low you can set this value, and set it appropriately.

###Add Google Play Services to the project

[WACOM.INCLUDE [Add Play Services](../includes/mobile-services-add-Google-play-services.md)]

###Add code

[WACOM.INCLUDE [mobile-services-android-getting-started-with-push](../includes/mobile-services-android-getting-started-with-push)]

<h2><a name="test-app"></a><span class="short-header">Test the app</span>Test the app against the published mobile service</h2>

You can test the app by directly attaching an Android phone with a USB cable, or by using a virtual device in the emulator.

###If you are using the emulator for testing...

Make sure you use an Android Virtual Device (AVD) that supports Google APIs.

1. From **Window**, select **Android Virtual Device Manager**, select your device, click **Edit** (or **New** if you don't have any devices).

	![](./media/mobile-services-android-get-started-push/mobile-services-android-virtual-device-manager.png)

2. Select **Google APIs** (or **Google APIs x86**)  in **Target**, then click OK.

   	![](./media/mobile-services-android-get-started-push/mobile-services-android-virtual-device-manager-edit.png)

	This targets the AVD to use Google APIs. If you have several versions of the Android SDK installed, make sure the API Level matches that which you set in the project properties earlier.

###Running the test

1. From the **Run** menu in Eclipse, then click **Run** to start the app.

2. In the app, type meaningful text, such as _A new Mobile Services task_ and then click the **Add** button.

  	![](./media/mobile-services-android-get-started-push/mobile-quickstart-push1-android.png)

3. Swipe down from the top of the screen to open the device's Notification Center to see the notification.

This tutorial demonstrates the basic push notification functionality provided by Mobile Services. If your app requires more advanced functionalities, such as sending cross-platform notifications, subscription-based routing, or very large volumes, consider using Windows Azure Notification Hubs with your mobile service. For more information, see one of the following Notification Hubs topics:

+ [Get started with Notification Hubs]
  <br/>Learn how to leverage Notification Hubs in your Android app.

+ [Send notifications to subscribers]
	<br/>Learn how users can register and receive push notifications for categories they're interested in.

+ [Send notifications to users]
	<br/>Learn how to send push notifications from a Mobile Service to specific users on any device.

+ [Send cross-platform notifications to users]
	<br/>Learn how to use templates to send push notifications from a Mobile Service, without having to craft platform-specific payloads in your back-end.
