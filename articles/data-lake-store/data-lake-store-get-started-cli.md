Learn how to use Azure command line interface to create an Azure Data Lake Store account and perform basic operations such as create folders, upload and download data files, delete your account, etc. For more information about Data Lake Store, see [Overview of Data Lake Store](data-lake-store-overview.md).

The Azure CLI is implemented in Node.js. It can be used on any platform that supports Node.js, including Windows, Mac, and Linux. The Azure CLI is open source. The source code is managed in GitHub at <a href= "https://github.com/azure/azure-xplat-cli">https://github.com/azure/azure-xplat-cli</a>. This article covers only using the Azure CLI with Data Lake Store. For a general guide on how to use Azure CLI, see [How to use the Azure CLI] [azure-command-line-tools].
