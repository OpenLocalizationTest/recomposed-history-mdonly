# Create your first search solution using Azure Search


<h2>Coming Soon</h2>

<p>We appreciate your patience as we put the finishing touches on a sample application that demonstrates the capabilities of Azure Search. It should be available in a couple of days. When its ready to go, you'll be able to download sample code and follow instructions to get it running in your Azure Search service.

A couple steps can be completed today. Get an early start by downloading a few items and configuring the service:

+	Visual Studio 2013 Express for the Web
+	Configure Azure Search Preview


<h3>Download Visual Studio 2013 Express for the Web</h3>

The sample application is authored in Visual Studio 2013. If you already have an existing edition of Visual Studio 2013, you should use it. Otherwise, you can download the free version from Microsoft. 

Go to the [Download Center](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=40747) to get Visual Studio 2013 Express for the Web.

<h3>Configure the free Search service</h3>

We recommend using the free service for this tutorial. This is a limited version of Search, available at no additional cost to all subscribers. If you don't have subscription, you can sign up for the Trial 

Go to [Configure Search on Azure Preview portal](../search-configure/) for details on setting up the service.

The instructions have more steps than you'll actually need. You can stop as soon as the free service is created. You will need the service URL and an api-key to complete this tutorial.
