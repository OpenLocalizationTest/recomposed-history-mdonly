#Create an ML workspace
To use ML Studio, you need to have an ML workspace. This workspace contains the tools you need to create, manage, and publish experiments.  

##To create a workspace  

1.	Sign in to your Microsoft Azure account.
2.	In the Microsoft Azure services panel, click **MACHINE LEARNING**.  
![Create workspace][1]

3.	Click **CREATE AN ML WORKSPACE**.
4.	In the **QUICK CREATE** page enter your workspace information and then click **CREATE AN ML WORKSPACE**.
	>**NOTE** - The **WORKSPACE OWNER** is your Microsoft Live ID (e.g., name@live.com).

After your ML workspace is created, you will see it listed on the **machine learning** page.  

>**Tip** – You can share the experiments you’re working on by inviting others to your workspace. You can do this in ML Studio on the **SETTINGS** page. You just need the Microsoft Live ID for each user.
