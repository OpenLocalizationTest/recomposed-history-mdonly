# Application Insights - Monitor usage and crashes in Windows Store and Phone apps

*Application Insights is in preview.*

Application Insights lets you monitor your published application for:

* **Usage** - Learn how many users you have and what they are doing with your app.
* **Crashes** - Get diagnostic reports of crashes and understand their impact on users.

* [Detect and diagnose crashes](#crashes)
* [Debug vs Release mode](#debug)

## <a name="start">Start monitoring your app</a>

#### <a name="add"></a>1. Add Application Insights

**If you're creating a new Windows Phone or Store project** select Application Insights in the New Project dialog. 

If you're asked to sign in, use the credentials for your Azure account (which is separate from your Visual Studio Online account).

![](./media/appinsights/appinsights-d21-new.png)


**If you already have a project** add Application Insights from Solution Explorer.

![](./media/appinsights/appinsights-d22-add.png)



#### <a name="run"></a>2. Run your project

[Run your application with F5](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/bg161304.aspx) and use it, so as to generate some telemetry. 

In Visual Studio, you'll see a count of the events that have been received.

![](./media/appinsights/appinsights-09eventcount.png)

In debug mode, telemetry is sent as soon as it's generated. In release mode, telemetry is stored on the device and sent only when the app resumes.

#### <a name="monitor"></a>3. See monitor data

Open Application Insights from your project.

![Right-click your project and open the Azure portal](./media/appinsights/appinsights-04-openPortal.png)


At first, you'll just see one or two points. For example:

![Click through to more data](./media/appinsights/appinsights-26-devices-01.png)

Click Refresh after a few seconds if you're expecting more data.

Click any chart to see more detail. 



#### <a name="deploy"></a>4. Publish your application to Store

[Publish your application](http://dev.windows.com/publish) and watch the data accumulate as users download and use it.



## <a name="usage"></a>Track usage

From the Overview timeline, click through Users and Sessions charts to see more detailed analytics.


![](./media/appinsights/appinsights-d018-oview.png)

* **Users** are tracked anonymously, so the same user on different devices would be counted twice.
* A **session** is counted when the app is suspended (for more than a brief interval, to avoid counting accidental suspensions).

#### Segmentation

Segment a chart to get a breakdown by a variety of criteria. For example, to see how many users are using each version of your app, open the Users chart and segment by Application Version: 

![On the users chart, switch on Segmenting and choose Application version](./media/appinsights/appinsights-d25-usage.png)


#### Page views

To discover the paths that users follow through your app, insert [page view telemetry][api] into  your code:

    var telemetry = new TelemetryClient();
    telemetry.TrackPageView("GameReviewPage");

See the results on the page views chart, and by opening its details:

![](./media/appinsights/appinsights-d27-pages.png)

Click through any page to see the details of specific occurrences.

#### Custom events

By inserting code to send custom events from your app, you can track your users' behavior and the usage of specific features and scenarios. 

For example:

    telemetry.TrackEvent("GameOver");

The data will appear in the Custom Events grid. You can either see an aggregated view in Metrics Explorer, or click through any event to see specific occurrences.

![](./media/appinsights/appinsights-d28-events.png)


You can add string and numeric properties to any event.


    // Set up some properties:
    var properties = new Dictionary <string, string> 
       {{"Game", currentGame.Name}, {"Difficulty", currentGame.Difficulty}};
    var measurements = new Dictionary <string, double>
       {{"Score", currentGame.Score}, {"Opponents", currentGame.OpponentCount}};

    // Send the event:
    telemetry.TrackEvent("GameOver", properties, measurements);


Click through any occurrence to see its detailed properties, including those you have defined.


![](./media/appinsights/appinsights-d29-eventProps.png)

See [API reference][api] for more about custom events.


## <a name="crashes"></a> Detect and diagnose crashes


#### Set an alert to detect crashes

![From the crashes chart, click Alert rules and then Add Alert](./media/appinsights/appinsights-d023-alert.png)

#### Diagnose crashes

To find out if some versions of your app crash more than others, click through the crashes chart and then segment by Application Version:

![](./media/appinsights/appinsights-d26crashSegment.png)


To discover the exceptions that are causing crashes, open Diagnostic Search. You might want to remove other types of telemetry, to focus on the exceptions:

![](./media/appinsights/appinsights-d26crashExceptions.png)

Click any exception to see its details, including associated properties and stack trace.

![](./media/appinsights/appinsights-d26crash.png)

See the other exceptions and events that occurred close to that exception:

## <a name="debug"></a>Debug vs Release mode

#### Debug

If you build in debug mode, events are sent as soon as they are generated. If you lose internet connectivity and then exit the app before regaining connectivity, offline telemetry is discarded.

#### Release

If you build in release configuration, events are stored in the device and sent when the application resumes. Data is also sent on the applicationâ€™s first use. If there is no internet connectivity upon startup, previous telemetry as well as telemetry for the current lifecycle is stored and sent on the next resume.
