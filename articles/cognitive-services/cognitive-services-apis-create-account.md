# Create a Cognitive Services APIs account in the Azure Portal

To use Microsoft Cognitive Service APIs, you first need to create an account in the Azure portal.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](http://portal.azure.com).

2. Click **+ NEW**.

3. Select **Intelligence + Analytics** and then **Cognitive Services APIs (preview)**.

    ![Select Cognitive Services APIs](media/cognitive-services-apis-create-account/select-cognitive-services-apis.png)

4. On the **Create** page, provide the following information:

    -   **Account Name:** Name of the account. We recommend using a descriptive name, for example *AFaceAPIAccount*.

    -   **Subscription:** Select one of the available Azure
    subscriptions in which you have at least Contributor permissions.

    -   **API Type:** Choose the Cognitive Services API you want to use. For more information about the various Cognitive Services APIs available, please refer to the [Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/cognitive-services/) site.

    -   **Pricing tier:** The cost of your Cognitive Services account
    depends on the actual usage and the options you choose. For more
    information about pricing for each API, please refer to the [pricing
    pages](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/cognitive-services/).

    -   **Resource Group:** A resource group is a collection of resources
    that share the same lifecycle, permissions, and policies. To
    learn more about Resource Groups, see
    [Manage Azure resources through portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-portal).

    -   **Resource Group Location:** This is required only if the API selected is
    global (not bound to a location). If the API is global and not bound
    to a location, however, you must specify a location for the resource
    group where the metadata associated with the Cognitive Services API
    account will reside. This location will have no impact on the
    runtime availability of your account. To learn more about resource
    group, please refer
    to [Manage Azure resources through portal](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-portal).

    -   **API Setting:** By default, account creation is disabled until your
    [Azure subscription service
    administrator](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/active-directory-assign-admin-roles)
    explicitly enables it.

        This setting change will apply only to the currently selected API type and location or Resource group location on the panel to the left.

        > [!NOTE]
        > If you receive a notification that the update setting failed, you are not logged in as an [Account Administrator](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-add-change-azure-subscription-administrator#types-of-azure-admin-accounts). If you are not the Account Administrator, email the administrator mailbox identified in the notification, or contact your company or department IT. The Account Administrator should follow the previous steps to enable creation.
        >
        > ![Update setting failed message](./media/cognitive-services-apis-create-account/updatefailed.png)
        
        In some cases, the Account Administrator may not have access to the subscription. If so, have the Service Administrator follow the steps in the [Add or change Azure administrator roles that manage the subscription or service](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/billing/billing-add-change-azure-subscription-administrator).
        
        If the Account Administrator does not know who the Service Administrator is, they can log in to the [Azure Account Center](https://account.windowsazure.com/) to find out.

    Microsoft may use data you send to the Cognitive Services to improve
    Microsoft products and services. For more information, please refer
    to the [Microsoft Cognitive Services
    section](http://www.microsoft.com/Licensing/product-licensing/products.aspx)
    in the Online Services Terms.

5. To pin the account to the Azure portal dashboard, click **Pin to Dashboard**.

6. Click **Create** to create the account.

After the Cognitive Services account is successfully deployed,
click the tile in the dashboard to view the account information.

You can use the **Endpoint URL** in the **Overview** section and keys in the **Keys** section to start making
API calls in your applications.
