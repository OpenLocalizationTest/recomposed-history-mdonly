## A

### Acoustic Model

The acoustic model is a classifier that labels short fragments of audio into one of a number of phonemes, or sound units, in a given language. For example, the word “speech” is comprised of four phonemes “s p iy ch”. These classifications are made on the order of 100 times per second

## J

## K

## L

### Language Model

The language model is a probability distribution over sequences of words. The language model helps the system decide among sequences of words that sound similar, based on the likelihood of the word sequences themselves

## M

## N

### Normalization

Normalization (Text) : Transformation of resulting text (i.e. transcription) into a standard, unambiguous form readable by the system.

## O

## P

## Q

## R

## S

### Search and Dictate Model

An acoustic model appropriate for processing commands. The Microsoft Search and Dictation AM is appropriate for speech directed at an application or device, such as such as commands

### Subscription key
