## Download and upload ##
There is also a way to replace your entire knowledge base at one go. This is ideal for bulk updates to your knowledge base. Upload KB expects file format of tab separated columns of Question, Answer and Source.

You have an option to download the entire knowledge base by clicking on Download Knowledge Base, make changes, and then upload the knowledge base.

Warning: Uploading a knowledge base overwrites the existing QnAs in the knowledge base.
