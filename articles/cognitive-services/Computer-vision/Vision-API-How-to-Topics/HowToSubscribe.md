## Obtaining Subscription Keys
Every call to the Computer Vision API requires a subscription key. This key needs to be either passed through a query string parameter or specified in the request header. 

The Computer Vision API offers two pricing tiers:
* [**Free**](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/subscriptions?productId=/products/54d873dd5eefd00dc474a0f4): Up to 5,000 calls per month, no charge.
* [**Standard**](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/apitype/ComputerVision/pricingtier/S0): Up to 10 TPS, $1.50 per 1,000 calls. 

To sign up for subscription keys, see [Subscriptions](https://www.microsoft.com/cognitive-services/en-us/sign-up). It's free to sign up. Pricing for these services is subject to change. 

**Note:** Free subscriptions that are not used for 90 days consecutively may expire. However, if your subscription expires you can request new keys.
