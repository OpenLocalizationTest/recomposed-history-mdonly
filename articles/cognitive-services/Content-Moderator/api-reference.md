## Image and Text Moderation APIs ##
You can get started on trying out the image and text moderation APIs in two ways:

  1. [Subscribe to the Content Moderator API](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.CognitiveServices/apitype/ContentModerator) on the Microsoft Azure portal.
  1. Sign up for the online [content moderator review tool](http://contentmoderator.cognitive.microsoft.com/). 

If you sign up for the review tool, you will find your Content Moderator API keys listed on the **Connectors** TAB in the **Settings** section as shown below.

The image and text moderation APIs scan your content and send the results with relevant information either back to your systems or to the built-in review tool, depending on who is calling the API. You can use this information to implement your own post-moderation workflow such as publish, reject, or review.

## List Management API ##
You can use your Content Moderator API credentials (for image, text and reviews) for the list management API as well. Use this API to create and manage your custom lists of Images and Text. The lists that you create can be used in the **Image/Match** and **Text/Screen** operations.
