# Utterances

Utterances are sentences representing examples of user queries or commands that your application is expected to receive and interpret. You need to add example utterances for each intent in your app. LUIS learns from these utterances and your app is able to generalise and understand similar contexts. By constantly adding more utterances and labeling them, you are enhancing your application’s language learning experience. 

For each intent, add example utterances that trigger this intent and include as many utterance variations as you expect users to say. The more relevant & diverse examples you add to the intent, the better intent prediction you’ll get from your app. For example, the utterance “book me a flight to Paris” may have variations such as “Reserve me a flight to Paris”, "book me a ticket to Paris", "Get me a ticket to Paris”, "Fly me to Paris", and "Take me on a flight to Paris".

Utterances are added to an intent on the **Utterances** tab of the intent page. The following steps describe how to add example utterances to an intent (e.g. "BookFlight" intent in the TravelAgent app). 

To learn about how to add utterances to your LUIS model and label intents and entities in them, see [Add utterances](Add-example-utterances.md).
