# Moving ExpressRoute circuits from Classic (ASM) to Resource Manager (ARM) Environment

This article provides an overview of what it means to move an ExpressRoute circuit from the classic to Resource Manager environment. 

[AZURE.INCLUDE [vpn-gateway-sm-rm](../../includes/vpn-gateway-sm-rm-include.md)]

A single ExpressRoute circuit can be used to connect to virtual networks (VNets) deployed both in the classic and  Resource Manager environments. An ExpressRoute circuit, irrespective of how it is created can now link to virtual networks across both environments.

## ExpressRoute circuits created in the ASM environment

ExpressRoute circuits created in the classic environment will have to be moved to the Resource Manager environment first to enable connectivity to both classic and Resource Manager environments. There will be no connectivity loss or disruption when a connection is being moved. All circuit-vnet links in the classic environment (within the same subscription and cross-subscription) will be preserved. Once the move is completed successfully, the ExpressRoute circuit will look, perform and feel exactly like an ExpressRoute circuit created in the resource manager environment. You will now be able to create connections to virtual networks in the Resource Manager environment. 

Once an ExpressRoute circuit has been moved to the Resource Manager environment, you will be able to manage the life cycle of the ExpressRoute circuit only using the Resource Manager environment. This means operations such as adding / updating / deleting peerings, updating circuit properties such as bandwidth, SKU and billing type and deleting circuits can only be performed in the Resource Manager environment. Refer to the section below on circuits created in the resource manager environment for further details on how you can manage access to both environments.

You will not have to involve your connectivity provider to perform the move. 

## ExpressRoute circuits created in the ARM environment

You can enable ExpressRoute circuits created in the Resource Manager environment to be accessible from both environments. Any ExpressRoute circuit in your subscription can be enabled to be accessed from both environments. 

- ExpressRoute circuits that were created in the Resource Manager environment will not have access to the classic environment by default.
- ExpressRoute circuits that have been moved from the classic environment to the Resource manager environment will be accessible from both environments by default.
- An ExpressRoute circuit will always have access to the resource manager environment irrespective of whether it was created in the Resource Manager environment or in the classic environment. This means you can create connections to virtual networks created in the Resource Manager environment by following instructions on [how to link virtual networks](expressroute-howto-linkvnet-arm.md). 
- Access to the classic environment is controlled by the "allowClassicOperations" parameter in the ExpressRoute circuit. 

>[AZURE.IMPORTANT] All quotas documented in the [ExpressRoute limits](../../includes/expressroute-limits.md)] page will apply. As an example, a standard circuit can have at most 10 VNet links / connections across both the classic and Resource Manager environments. 


### Controlling access to classic environment

You can enable a single ExpressRoute circuit to link to VNets in both environments by setting the "allowClassicOperations" parameter of the ExpressRoute circuit.

Setting "allowClassicOperations" to TRUE will enable you to link vnets from both environments to the ExpressRoute circuit. You can link to VNets in classic environment by following guidance on [how to link virtual networks in the classic environment](expressroute-howto-linkvnet-classic.md). You can link to VNets in Resource Manager environment mode by following guidance on [how to link virtual networks in the Resource Manager environment](expressroute-howto-linkvnet-arm.md).

Setting "allowClassicOperations" to FALSE will block access to the circuit from the classic environment. All vnet links in the classic environment will however be preserved. In this case, the ExpressRoute circuit will not be visible in the classic environment.

### Supported operations in the classic environment

The following classic operations are supported on an ExpressRoute circuit when "allowClassicOperations" is set to TRUE.

 - Get ExpressRoute Circuit information
 - Create / Update / Get / Delete VNet links to classic VNets
 - Create / Update / Get / Delete VNet link authorizations for cross-subscription connectivity

You will not be able to perform the following classic operations when "allowClassicOperations" is set to TRUE.

 - Create / Update / Get / Delete BGP peerings for Azure private, Azure public and Microsoft peerings
 - Delete ExpressRoute circuit

## ASM - ARM communication

The ExpressRoute circuit will act like a bridge between the classic and Resource Manager environments. Traffic between virtual machines deployed in vnets in the classic environment and those deployed in vnets in the Resource environment will flow through the ExpressRoute if both vnets are linked to the same ExpressRoute circuit. Aggregate throughput will be limited by the throughput capacity of the virtual network gateway. Traffic will not enter the connectivity provider's or your networks in such cases. Traffic flow between the VNets will be fully contained within the Microsoft network. 

## Access to Azure Public and Microsoft peering resources

You can continue to access resources typically accessible through Azure Public peering and Microsoft peering without any disruption.  

## What's supported

This section describes what's supported through this capability

 - A single ExpressRoute circuit can be used to access vnets deployed in the classic and Resource Manager environments.
 - You can move an ExpressRotue circuit from classic to Resource Manager environment. Once moved, the ExpressRoute circuit will look, feel and perform like any other ExpressRoute circuit created in the Resource Manager environment.
 - Only the ExpressRoute circuit can be moved. Circuit links, VNets and VPN gateways will not be moved through this operation.
 - Once an ExpressRoute circuit has been moved to the Resource Manager environment, you will be able to manage the life cycle of the ExpressRoute circuit only using the Resource Manager environment. This means operations such as adding / updating / deleting peerings, updating circuit properties such as bandwidth, SKU and billing type and deleting circuits can only be performed in the Resource Manager environment.
 - The ExpressRoute circuit will act like a bridge between the classic and Resource Manager environments. Traffic between virtual machines deployed in vnets in the classic environment and those deployed in vnets in the Resource environment will flow through ExpressRoute if both vnets are linked to the same ExpressRoute circuit. 
 - Cross-subscription connectivity in both classic and Resource Manager environments.

## What's NOT supported

This section describes what's not supported through this capability

 - Moving Circuit links, gateways and virtual networks from classic to Resource Manager environment.
 - Managing the lifecycle of the ExpressRoute circuit from the classic environment.
 - RBAC support for classic environment. You will not be able to perform RBAC controls to the circuit in the classic environment. Any admin / co-admin of the subscription will be able to link / unlink vnets to the circuit.

## Configuration

Follow instructions described in [Moving an ExpressRoute circuit from classic to Resource Manager](expressroute-howto-move-arm.md)
