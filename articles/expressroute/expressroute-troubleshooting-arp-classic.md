# ExpressRoute troubleshooting guide--Getting ARP tables in the Classic deployment model

This article walks you through the steps for getting the ARP tables for your ExpressRoute circuit.

>[AZURE.IMPORTANT] This document is intended to help you diagnose and fix simple issues. It is not intended to be a replacement for Microsoft support. If you are can't solve the problem using the following guidance, open a support ticket with [Microsoft support](https://portal.azure.com/?#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade)

## Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) and ARP tables
Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is a layer 2 protocol that's defined in [RFC 826](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc826). ARP is used to map an Ethernet address (MAC address) with an IP address.

The ARP table provides a mapping of the ipv4 address and MAC address for a particular peering. The ARP table for an ExpressRoute circuit peering provides the following information for each interface (primary and secondary):

1. Mapping of on-premises router interface IP address to the MAC address
2. Mapping of ExpressRoute router interface IP address to the MAC address
3. The age of the mapping

ARP tables can help with validating layer 2 configuration and with troubleshooting basic layer 2 connectivity issues.

Example ARP table:

		Age InterfaceProperty IpAddress  MacAddress    
		--- ----------------- ---------  ----------    
		 10 On-Prem           10.0.0.1 ffff.eeee.dddd
		  0 Microsoft         10.0.0.2 aaaa.bbbb.cccc


The following section provides information about how you can view the ARP tables seen by the ExpressRoute edge routers.

## Prerequisites for learning ARP tables

Ensure that you have the following before you progress further:

 - A valid ExpressRoute circuit that's configured with at least one peering. The circuit must be fully configured by the connectivity provider. You (or your connectivity provider) must have configured at least one of the peerings (Azure private, Azure public, or Microsoft) on this circuit.

 - IP address ranges that are used for configuring the peerings (Azure private, Azure public and Microsoft). Review the IP address assignment examples in the [ExpressRoute routing requirements page](expressroute-routing.md) to get an understanding of how IP addresses are mapped to interfaces on your aise and on the ExpressRoute side. You can get information about the peering configuration by reviewing the [ExpressRoute peering configuration page](expressroute-howto-routing-classic.md).

 - Information from your networking team or connectivity provider about the MAC addresses of the interfaces that are used with these IP addresses.

 - You must have the latest Windows PowerShell module for Azure (version 1.50 or later).

## Getting the ARP tables for your ExpressRoute circuit
This section provides instructions about how you to view the ARP tables per peering using PowerShell. You or your connectivity provider must have configured the peering before progressing further. Each circuit has two paths (primary and secondary). You can check the ARP table for each path independently.

### ARP tables for Azure private peering
The following cmdlet provides the ARP tables for Azure private peering

		# Required Variables
		$ckt = "<your Service Key here>

		# ARP table for Azure private peering - Primary path
		Get-AzureDedicatedCircuitPeeringArpInfo -ServiceKey $ckt -AccessType Private -Path Primary

		# ARP table for Azure private peering - Secodary path
		Get-AzureDedicatedCircuitPeeringArpInfo -ServiceKey $ckt -AccessType Private -Path Secondary

Sample output is shown below for one of the paths:

		Age InterfaceProperty IpAddress  MacAddress    
		--- ----------------- ---------  ----------    
		 10 On-Prem           10.0.0.1 ffff.eeee.dddd
		  0 Microsoft         10.0.0.2 aaaa.bbbb.cccc


### ARP tables for Azure public peering:
The following cmdlet provides the ARP tables for Azure public peering

		# Required Variables
		$ckt = "<your Service Key here>

		# ARP table for Azure public peering - Primary path
		Get-AzureDedicatedCircuitPeeringArpInfo -ServiceKey $ckt -AccessType Public -Path Primary

		# ARP table for Azure public peering - Secodary path
		Get-AzureDedicatedCircuitPeeringArpInfo -ServiceKey $ckt -AccessType Public -Path Secondary

Sample output is shown below for one of the paths:

		Age InterfaceProperty IpAddress  MacAddress    
		--- ----------------- ---------  ----------    
		 10 On-Prem           10.0.0.1 ffff.eeee.dddd
		  0 Microsoft         10.0.0.2 aaaa.bbbb.cccc


Sample output is shown below for one of the paths:

		Age InterfaceProperty IpAddress  MacAddress    
		--- ----------------- ---------  ----------    
		 10 On-Prem           64.0.0.1 ffff.eeee.dddd
		  0 Microsoft         64.0.0.2 aaaa.bbbb.cccc


### ARP tables for Microsoft peering
The following cmdlet provides the ARP tables for Microsoft peering:

    # ARP table for Microsoft peering - Primary path
    Get-AzureDedicatedCircuitPeeringArpInfo -ServiceKey $ckt -AccessType Microsoft -Path Primary

    # ARP table for Microsoft peering - Secodary path
    Get-AzureDedicatedCircuitPeeringArpInfo -ServiceKey $ckt -AccessType Microsoft -Path Secondary


Sample output is shown below for one of the paths

		Age InterfaceProperty IpAddress  MacAddress    
		--- ----------------- ---------  ----------    
		 10 On-Prem           65.0.0.1 ffff.eeee.dddd
		  0 Microsoft         65.0.0.2 aaaa.bbbb.cccc


## How to use this information
The ARP table of a peering can be used to validate layer 2 configuration and connectivity. This section provides an overview of how ARP tables look in different scenarios.

### ARP table when a circuit is in an operational (expected) state

 - The ARP table has  an entry for the on-premises side with a valid IP  and MAC address, and a similar entry for the Microsoft side.
 - The last octet of the on-premises IP address is always an odd number.
 - The last octet of the Microsoft IP address is always be an even number.
 - The same MAC address appears on the Microsoft side for all three peerings (primary/secondary).


		Age InterfaceProperty IpAddress  MacAddress    
		--- ----------------- ---------  ----------    
		 10 On-Prem           65.0.0.1 ffff.eeee.dddd
		  0 Microsoft         65.0.0.2 aaaa.bbbb.cccc

### ARP table when it's on-premises or when the connectivity-provider side has problems

 Only one entry appears in the ARP table. This shows the mapping between the MAC address and the IP address that's used on the Microsoft side.

		Age InterfaceProperty IpAddress  MacAddress    
		--- ----------------- ---------  ----------    
		  0 Microsoft         65.0.0.2 aaaa.bbbb.cccc

>[AZURE.NOTE] If you experience an issue like this, open a support request with your connectivity provider to resolve it.


### ARP table when Microsoft side has problems

 - You will not see an ARP table shown for a peering if there are issues on the Microsoft side.
 -  Open a support ticket with [Microsoft support](https://portal.azure.com/?#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade). Specify that you have an issue with layer 2 connectivity.

## Next steps

 - Validate Layer 3 configurations for your ExpressRoute circuit
	 - Get a route summary to determine the state of BGP sessions.
	 - Get a route table to determine which prefixes are advertised across ExpressRoute.
 - Validate data transfer by reviewing bytes in and out.
 - Open a support ticket with [Microsoft support](https://portal.azure.com/?#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade) if you are still experiencing issues.
