# Azure Disk Encryption Troubleshooting Guide

This guide is for information technology (IT) professionals, information security analysts, and cloud administrators whose organizations are using Azure disk encryption and need guidance to troubleshoot disk encryption related issues.

## Troubleshooting Linux OS disk encryption

Linux OS disk encryption must unmount the OS drive prior to running it through the full disk encryption process.   If it cannot, an error message of "failed to unmount after…" error message is likely to occur.

This is most likely when OS disk encryption is attempted on a target VM environment that has been modified or changed from its supported stock gallery image.  Examples of deviations from the supported image, which can interfere with the extension’s ability to unmount the OS drive include:
- Customized images that no longer match a supported file system and/or partitioning scheme.
- When large applications such as SAP, MongoDB, or Apache Cassandra are installed and running in the OS prior to encryption.  The extension is unable to properly shut these down, and if they maintain open file handles to the OS drive, the drive cannot be unmounted, causing failure.
- When custom scripts are being run in close time proximity to the encryption being enabled, or if any other changes are being made on the VM during the encryption process.   This can happen when a Resource Manager template template defines multiple extensions to execute simultaneously, or when a custom script extension or other action is run simultaneously to disk encryption.   Serializing and isolating such steps may resolve the issue.
- When SELinux has not been disabled prior to enabling encryption, the unmount step fails.  SELinux can be re-enabled after encryption has completed.
- When the OS disk is using an LVM scheme (although limited LVM data disk support is available, LVM OS disk is not)
- When minimum memory requirements are not met (7GB is suggested for OS disk encryption)
- When data drives have been recursively mounted under mnt or each other (eg., /mnt/data1, /mnt/data2, /data3 + /data3/data4, etc.)
- When other Azure Disk Encryption [prerequisites](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/security/azure-security-disk-encryption) for Linux are not met

## Unable to encrypt

In some cases the Linux disk encryption appears to be stuck at "OS disk encryption started" and SSH is disabled. This process can take between 3-16 hours to complete and may simply require more time.  Linux OS disk encryption sequence unmounts the OS drive temporarily, and performs block by block encryption of the entire OS disk, before remounting it in its encrypted state.   Unlike Azure Disk Encryption on Windows, Linux Disk Encryption does not allow concurrent use of the VM while the encryption is in progress.  The performance characteristics of the VM, including the size of the disk and whether the storage account is backed by standard or premium (SSD) storage, can greatly influence the time required to complete encryption.

To check status, the ProgressMessage field returned from the [Get-AzureRmVmDiskEncryptionStatus](https://docs.microsoft.com/powershell/module/azurerm.compute/get-azurermvmdiskencryptionstatus) command can be polled.   While the OS drive is being encrypted, the VM enters a servicing state, and SSH is also disabled to prevent any disruption to the ongoing process.  EncryptionInProgress will be reported for the majority of the time while encryption is in progress, followed several hours later with a VMRestartPending message prompting to restart the VM.  For example:


```
PS > Get-AzureRmVMDiskEncryptionStatus -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName -VMName $vmName
OsVolumeEncrypted          : EncryptionInProgress
DataVolumesEncrypted       : EncryptionInProgress
OsVolumeEncryptionSettings : Microsoft.Azure.Management.Compute.Models.DiskEncryptionSettings
ProgressMessage            : OS disk encryption started

PS > Get-AzureRmVMDiskEncryptionStatus -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroupName -VMName $vmName
OsVolumeEncrypted          : VMRestartPending
DataVolumesEncrypted       : Encrypted
OsVolumeEncryptionSettings : Microsoft.Azure.Management.Compute.Models.DiskEncryptionSettings
ProgressMessage            : OS disk successfully encrypted, please reboot the VM
```

Once prompted to reboot the VM, and after restarting the VM, and giving 2-3 minutes for the reboot and for final steps to be performed on the target, the status message will indicate that encryption has finally completed.   Once this message is available, the encrypted OS drive is expected to be ready for use and for the VM to be usable again.

In cases where this sequence was not seen, or if boot information, progress message, or other error indicators report that OS encryption has failed in the middle of this process (for example if you are seeing the "failed to unmount" error described in this guide), it is recommended to restore the VM back to the snapshot or backup taken immediately prior to encryption.  Prior to the next attempt, it is suggested to re-evaluate the characteristics of the VM and ensure that all prerequisites are satisfied.

## Troubleshooting Azure Disk Encryption behind a Firewall
When connectivity is restricted by a firewall, proxy requirement, or network security group (NSG) settings, the ability of the extension to perform needed tasks can be disrupted.   This can result in status messages such as "Extension status not available on the VM" and in expected scenarios failing to finish.  The sections that follow has some common firewall issues that you may investigate.

### Network security groups
Any network security group settings applied must still allow the endpoint to meet the documented network configuration [prerequisites](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/security/azure-security-disk-encryption#prerequisites) for disk encryption.

### Azure Keyvault behind firewall
The VM must be able to access key vault. Refer to guidance on access to key fault from behind a firewall that is maintained by the [Key Vault](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/key-vault-access-behind-firewall) team.

### Linux package management behind firewall
At run time, Azure Disk Encryption for Linux relies on the target distribution’s package management system to install needed prerequisite components prior to enabling encryption.  If firewall settings prevent the VM from being able to download and install these components, then subsequent failures are expected.    The steps to configure this may vary by distribution.  On Red Hat, when a proxy is required, ensuring that subscription-manager and yum are set up properly is vital.  See [this](https://access.redhat.com/solutions/189533) Red Hat support article on this topic.
