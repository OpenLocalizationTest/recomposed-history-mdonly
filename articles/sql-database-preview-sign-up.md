# Walkthrough: Sign Up for the Azure SQL Database V12 Preview

This topic describes the steps you can follow to sign up for the Azure SQL Database Update V12 (preview), as released by Microsoft in December 2014.

You must sign up for the V12 preview before you can create or update a database with the preview. If you attempt to upgrade your existing database before you sign up for the preview, the Azure portal redirects you to the sign-up blade for the preview.

For more information about the preview, see [Plan and Prepare to Upgrade to Azure SQL Database V12 Preview](http://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/articles/sql-database-preview-plan-prepare-upgrade/).


## Security authorization

To have sufficient authorization to sign up for the preview, you must be as one of the following:

- The subscription owner
- A co-administrator of the subscription

For more information about Azure accounts, see [Manage Accounts, Subscriptions, and Administrative Roles](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh531793.aspx).

## Sequence options for sign up

You can sign up for the V12 preview when you attempt to create a new database on the preview version. During the sequence the system detects that you must sign up, and it takes you to a check box where you can agree and sign up.

You can also sign up for the preview by clicking on the **Portal settings** part on the Azure portal.
