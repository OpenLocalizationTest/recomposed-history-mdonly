# Partners in B2B scenarios

Before you and another entity or organization can engage 
in Business-to-Business (B2B) messages and transactions, 
you must both share information that helps identify 
and validate messages sent by each other. 
After you discuss these details and are ready 
to start your business relationship, 
you can create *partners* to represent 
you both in your integration account.

## What roles do partners perform in an integration account?

You create agreements between partners to define the details 
about the messages that those partners exchange.

Before you can create an agreement, you must have added 
at least two partners to your integration account. 
Your organization must be part of the agreement as the **host partner**. 
The other partner, or **guest partner** represents the organization 
that exchanges messages with your organization. 
The guest partner can be another company, 
or even a department in your own organization.

After you add these partners, you can create an agreement.

Receive and Send settings are oriented from the point of view of the Hosted Partner. For example, the receive settings in an agreement determine how the hosted partner receives messages sent from a guest partner. Likewise, the send settings on the agreement indicate how the hosted partner sends messages to the guest partner.

## How to create a partner?
