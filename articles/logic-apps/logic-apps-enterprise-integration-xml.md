# XML processing
Validate and process XML documents that you exchange with partners in B2B scenarios more easily when you use the Enterprise Integration Pack with Azure Logic Apps. Here are the ways you can process XML messages:

* [XML validation](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-xml-validation.md "Learn about XML message validation") - Validate a message that originates from a source endpoint against a specific schema.
* [XML transform](../logic-apps/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-transform.md "Learn about XML message transformations and maps") - Convert an XML message based on the requirements of a destination endpoint.
* [Flat file encoding and flat file decoding](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-flatfile.md "Learn about flat file encoding/decoding") - Encode or decode a flat file. 
* [XPath](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/mt643789.aspx) - Enrich a message and extract specific properties from the message. You can then use the extracted properties to route the message to a destination or an intermediary endpoint.
