# Create a new logic app connecting SaaS services
This topic demonstrates how, in just a few minutes, you can get started with [Azure Logic Apps](logic-apps-what-are-logic-apps.md). We'll walk through a simple workflow that lets you send interesting tweets to your email.

To use this scenario, you need:

* An Azure subscription
* A Twitter account
* A Outlook.com or Office 365 Outlook account

## Create a new logic app to email you tweets

1. On the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), select **New**.

2. In the search box, search for 'logic app', and press Enter. 
You can also select **New**, **Enterprise Integration**, and select **Logic App**. 

3. Enter a name for your logic app, select your Azure subscription, 
4. create or select an Azure resource group, select a location, and choose **Create**. 

	If you select **Pin to Dashboard**, the logic app automatically opens after deployment.

4. When you open your logic app for the first time, you can select from a template to start.
For now click **Blank Logic App** to build this from scratch. 

5. The first item you need to create is the trigger. This is the event that starts your logic app. 
In the search box, search for **twitter**, and select **When a new tweet is posted**. 
Sign in with the user name and password for your Twitter account.

6. Now type in a search term to trigger your logic app.

	The **Frequency** and **Interval** determine 
	how often your logic app checks for new tweets, 
	and returns all tweets during that time span.

7. Select **New step**, and choose **Add an action** or **Add a condition**.

	When you select **Add an Action**, 
	you can search [available connectors](../connectors/apis-list.md) to choose an action. 

8.	In the search box, search for **outlook**, and select **Send an email** 
to send email from your Outlook account to any specified email address.

9. Now you have to fill out the parameters for the email you want:

10. Finally, you can select **Save** to make your logic app live.

## Manage your logic app after creation
Now your logic app is up and running. It will periodically check for tweets with the search term entered. When it finds a matching tweet, it will send you an email. Finally, you'll see how to disable the app, or see how itâ€™s doing.

1. Go to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com)
2. Click **Browse** on the left side of the screen and select **Logic Apps**.
3. Click the new logic app that you just created to see current status and general information.
4. To edit your new logic app, click **Edit**.
5. To turn off the app, click **Disable** in the command bar.
6. View run and trigger histories to monitor when your logic app is running.  You can click **Refresh** to see the latest data.

In less than 5 minutes you were able to set up a simple logic app running in the cloud. To learn more about using Logic Apps features, see [Use logic app features].
