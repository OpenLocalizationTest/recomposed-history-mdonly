# Create your first logic app workflow to automate processes between cloud apps and services

In just a few minutes and without writing any code, 
you can create a basic workflow that automates a process 
between cloud services with [Azure Logic Apps](logic-apps-what-are-logic-apps.md). 
This example logic app sends email to an Outlook or Gmail account 
when new content appears in a website's RSS feed.

Before you start, you need these items:

* An Azure subscription 

	If you don't have a subscription, 
	[start with a free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/). 
	Otherwise, you can [sign up for a Pay-As-You-Go subscription](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/purchase-options/).

	Your Azure subscription is used for billing certain steps 
	or tasks that your logic app performs while active and running. 
	Learn how [usage metering and billing](../logic-apps/logic-apps-pricing.md) 
	and [pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/logic-apps/) 
	work for Azure Logic Apps.

* A mail account for Outlook.com, Office 365, or Gmail

* A link to a website's RSS feed. This example uses 
the RSS feed for MSDN Channel 9:```https://s.ch9.ms/Feeds/RSS```

## Add a trigger that starts your workflow

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com "Azure portal").

2. From the left menu, choose **New (+)** > **Enterprise Integration** > **Logic App**.

	![Azure portal, New, Enterprise Integration, Logic App](media/logic-apps-create-a-logic-app/azure-portal-create-logic-app.png)

   > [!TIP]
   > You can also choose **New**, and then in the search box, 
   > type ```logic app``` for your filter, and then press Enter. 
   > Choose **Logic App** > **Create**.

3. Name your logic app and select your Azure subscription. 
Now select or create an Azure resource group, which helps you organize and 
manage related Azure resources. Finally, select the datacenter location 
for hosting your logic app. When you're done, choose **Create**.

	![Logic app details](media/logic-apps-create-a-logic-app/logic-app-settings.png)

   > [!NOTE]
   > If you select **Pin to dashboard**, 
   > your logic app appears on the Azure dashboard after deployment, 
   > and opens automatically. But if your logic app doesn't appear on the dashboard, 
   > on the **All resources** tile, choose **See More**, and select your logic app. 
   > Or on the left menu, choose **More services**, and under **Enterprise Integration**, 
   > choose **Logic Apps**, then select your logic app.

4. When you open your logic app for the first time, 
the Logic Apps Designer shows templates that 
you can use to get started. 
For now, choose **Blank Logic App** so you can 
build your logic app from scratch.

	The Logic App Designer opens and shows 
	available services and *triggers*. 
	The trigger is the event that starts your 
	logic app and is the first item that your logic app needs. 

5. In the search box, type ```RSS`` so you can find and select this 
trigger: **RSS - When a feed item is published** 

	![RSS trigger](media/logic-apps-create-a-logic-app/rss-trigger.png)

6. Enter the link for the website's RSS feed that you want to track. 

	You can also change **Frequency** and **Interval**. 
	These settings determine how often your logic app checks for 
	new items and returns all items during that time span.

	For this example, let's check every day for new 
	items posted to the MSDN Channel 9 website.

	![Set up trigger with RSS feed, frequency, and interval](media/logic-apps-create-a-logic-app/rss-trigger-setup.png)

7. Save your changes. On the designer command bar, choose **Save**.

	![Save your logic app](media/logic-apps-create-a-logic-app/save-logic-app.png)

	Your logic app is now live and periodically checks 
	for new items in the specified RSS feed. However, 
	to make this scenario more interesting, we add an action.

## Add an action that responds to your trigger

Now we set up the logic app to send email when new items appear in an RSS feed.

1. Under your trigger in the designer, choose **New step** > **Add an action**. 

	![Add an action](media/logic-apps-create-a-logic-app/add-new-action.png)

	The designer shows [available connectors](../connectors/apis-list.md) so 
	that you can select an action to perform when your trigger fires.

2. Based on the mail account that you have, follow the steps for Outlook or Gmail.

	*	To send mail to your Outlook account, 
	in the search box, enter ```outlook```. 
	Under **Services**, select either **Outlook.com** 
	or **Office 365 Outlook**. Under **Actions**, 
	select **Send an email**.

		![Select Outlook "Send an email" action](media/logic-apps-create-a-logic-app/actions.png)

	*	To send mail to your Gmail account, 
	in the search box, enter ```gmail```. 
	Under **Actions**, select **Gmail - Send email**.

		![Choose "Gmail - Send email"](media/logic-apps-create-a-logic-app/actions-gmail.png)

3. When you're prompted for credentials, 
sign in with the username and password for your email account. 

4. Choose the parameters for the data output 
that you want included in your email.

	![Select data to include in email](media/logic-apps-create-a-logic-app/rss-action-setup.png)

	For example, if you chose Outlook, 
	your logic app might look like this example:

	![Completed logic app](media/logic-apps-create-a-logic-app/save-run-complete-logic-app.png)

5. Save your changes. (On the designer command bar, choose **Save**)

	Now when your logic app checks the specified RSS feed and 
	finds new items, you get an email that includes your selected data. 
	If no new items are found, your logic app "skips" the action 
	that sends you mail.

6. To manually trigger your logic app at any time, 
choose **Run** on the designer command bar.

7. To monitor your logic app and view run and trigger histories, 
on your logic app menu, choose **Overview**. To update the data, 
choose **Refresh**. 

	To view your logic app's status or run and trigger 
	history, or to diagnose your logic app, see 
	[Troubleshoot your logic app](logic-apps-diagnosing-failures.md).

      > [!NOTE]
      > Your logic app continues running until you turn off your app. 
      > To turn off your app for now, on your logic app menu, 
      > choose **Overview**. On the command bar, choose **Disable**.

Congratulations, you just set up and run your first basic logic app. 
You also learned how easily you can create workflows that automate 
processes and integrate cloud apps and cloud services - all without code.

## Manage your logic app

To check on, edit, or turn off your logic app, 
follow these steps.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com "Azure portal").

2. On the left menu, choose **More services**. Under **Enterprise Integration**,  
choose **Logic Apps**. Select your logic app.

	*	To check your app's status and general information, 
	choose **Overview**.

	*	To edit your app, choose **Logic App Designer**.

	*	To turn off your app for now, choose **Overview**. 
	On the command bar, choose **Disable**.

	*	To delete your logic app, choose **Overview**. 
	On the command bar, choose **Delete**. Enter your 
	logic app's name, then choose **Delete**.
