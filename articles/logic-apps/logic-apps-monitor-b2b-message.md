# Log and monitor AS2, X12, and EDIFACT messages for success, errors, and message properties

When you set up B2B communication for your logic app 
between two running business processes or applications, 
those entities can exchange messages with each other. 
After you set up this communication, you can set up message monitoring 
so that you can confirm that communication works as expected. 
For richer details and debugging, you can also set up diagnostics for your integration account.

Message tracking is available for these B2B protocols: AS2, X12, and EDIFACT. 

## Requirements

* An Azure account, if you don't have this already. You can 
[create a free account here](https://azure.microsoft.com/free).

* A logic app with diagnostics and logging already set up. 
Learn [how to create a logic app](logic-apps-create-a-logic-app.md) 
and [how to set up logging for that logic app](logic-apps-monitor-your-logic-apps.md#azure-diagnostics-and-alerts).

* An integration account. Learn 
[how to create an integration account](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-create-integration-account.md).

## Turn on logging and diagnostics for your integration account

You can turn on logging either directly from your integration account 
or [through the Azure Monitor service](#azure-monitor-service), 
which provides [basic monitoring with infrastructure-level data](../monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-overview.md). 
Learn more about [Azure Monitor](../monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-overview-azure-monitor.md).

### Turn on logging directly from your integration account

1. In the Azure portal, find and select your integration account. 
Under **Monitoring**, choose **Diagnostics logs** as shown here:

   ![Find and select your integration account, choose "Diagnostic logs"](media/logic-apps-monitor-b2b-message/integration-account-diagnostics.png)

2. Now perform these steps as shown:

	1. Under **Subscription**, select the Azure subscription 
	that you're using with your integration account.
	2. Under **Resource group**, select the resource group that 
	you're using with your integration account.
	3. Under **Resource type**, select **Integration accounts**. 
	4. Under **Resource**, select your integration account. 
	5. To turn on diagnostics for your selected integration account, 
	choose **Turn on diagnostics**.

	![Set up diagnostics for your integration account](media/logic-apps-monitor-b2b-message/turn-on-diagnostics-integration-account.png)

3. Under **Diagnostics settings**, **Status**, choose **On**.

   ![Turn on diagnostics](media/logic-apps-monitor-b2b-message/turn-on-diagnostics-integration-account-2.png)

4. Now perform these steps as shown:

   1. Select **Send to Log Analytics**. 
   2. Under **Log Analytics**, choose **Configure**. 
   3. Under **OMS Workspaces**, select the OMS workspace in Log Analytics 
   that you want to use for sending diagnostics data to a log.
   4. Under **Log**, select **IntegrationAccountTrackingEvents**.
   5. When you're done, choose **Save**.

### Turn on logging through the Monitor service

1. In the Azure portal, on the main left menu, 
choose **Monitor**, **Diagnostics logs**. 
Then select your integration account as shown here:

   ![Choose "Monitor", "Diagnostic logs", select your integration account](media/logic-apps-monitor-b2b-message/monitor-service-diagnostics-logs.png)

2. After you select your integration account, 
the following values are automatically selected. 
If these values are correct, choose **Turn on diagnostics**. 
Otherwise, select the correct values now:

   1. Under **Subscription**, select the Azure subscription 
   that you're using with your integration account.
   2. Under **Resource group**, select the resource group that 
   you're using with your integration account.
   3. Under **Resource type**, select **Integration accounts**.
   4. Under **Resource**, select your integration account.
   5. Choose **Turn on diagnostics**.

	![Set up diagnostics for your integration account](media/logic-apps-monitor-b2b-message/turn-on-diagnostics-integration-account.png)

3. Under **Diagnostics settings**, **Status**, choose **On**.

   ![Turn on diagnostics](media/logic-apps-monitor-b2b-message/turn-on-diagnostics-integration-account-2.png)

4. Now perform these steps as shown:

   1. Select **Send to Log Analytics**. 
   2. Under **Log Analytics**, choose **Configure**. 
   3. Under **OMS Workspaces**, select the OMS workspace in Log Analytics 
   that you want to use for sending diagnostics data to a log.
   4. Under **Log**, select **IntegrationAccountTrackingEvents**.
   5. When you're done, choose **Save**.

## Expand how and where you use diagnostic data with other services

Along with **Log Analytics**, you can set up your integration account, 
and also your [logic app](logic-apps-monitor-your-logic-apps.md), so that diagnostics 
data is archived with the [Azure Storage service](../storage/storage-introduction.md) 
or streamed through the [Azure Event Hubs service](../event-hubs/event-hubs-what-is-event-hubs.md). 
That way, you can get real-time monitoring for your integration workflows by using the telemetry 
that you send to Azure Storage or Azure Event Hubs with other services like 
[Azure Stream Analytics](../stream-analytics/stream-analytics-introduction.md) 
and [Power BI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com). 

Learn more about [monitoring and diagnostics in Azure](../monitoring-and-diagnostics/monitoring-overview.md). 
Based on the options that you want to set up, make sure that you first 
[create an Azure storage account](../storage/storage-create-storage-account.md) 
or [create an Azure event hub](../event-hubs/event-hubs-create.md):

![Send data to Azure storage account or event hub](./media/logic-apps-monitor-b2b-message/storage-account-event-hubs.png)

## Supported tracking schema

We support these tracking schema types, which all have fixed schemas except the Custom type.

* [Custom tracking schema](logic-apps-track-integration-account-custom-tracking-schema.md)
* [AS2 tracking schema](logic-apps-track-integration-account-as2-tracking-schemas.md)
* [X12 tracking schema](logic-apps-track-integration-account-x12-tracking-schema.md)

## Next steps

* [Track B2B messages in OMS](logic-apps-track-b2b-messages-omsportal.md "Track B2B messages in OMS")
* [Learn more about the Enterprise Integration Pack](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-overview.md "Learn about Enterprise Integration Pack")
