# Connect to on-premises data from logic apps

To access data in an on-premises system, you can set up a connection to an 
on-premises data gateway for supported Azure Logic Apps connectors. 
These steps walk you through how to install and set up the 
on-premises data gateway to work with your logic apps. 
The on-premises data gateway supports these connections:

*   BizTalk Server
*   DB2  
*   File System
*   Informix
*   MQ
*   MySQL
*   Oracle Database 
*   SAP Application Server 
*   SAP Message Server
*   SharePoint for HTTP only, not HTTPS
*   SQL Server
*   Teradata

For more information about these connections, see 
[Connectors for Azure Logic Apps](../connectors/apis-list.md).

## Requirements

* You must have an Azure work or school email address and Azure subscription 
to associate the on-premises data gateway with your Azure Active Directory-based account.

* If you are using a Microsoft account, like @outlook.com, you can use your Azure account to 
[create a work or school email address](../virtual-machines/windows/create-aad-work-id.md#locate-your-default-directory-in-the-azure-classic-portal).

* You must have already [installed the on-premises data gateway on a local machine](logic-apps-gateway-install.md).

* You can associate your installation to one gateway resource only. 
Your gateway can't be claimed by another Azure on-premises data gateway. 
Claim happens at ([creation during Step 2 in this topic](#2-create-an-azure-on-premises-data-gateway-resource)).

## Install and set up the data gateway connection

### 1. Install the on-premises data gateway

If you haven't already, follow these steps to 
[install the on-premises data gateway](logic-apps-gateway-install.md). 
Before you can continue with the other steps, 
make sure that you installed the data gateway on an on-premises machine.

### 2. Create an Azure resource for the on-premises data gateway

After you install the gateway, you must associate the gateway with your Azure subscription 
and create an Azure resource for the data gateway.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com "Azure portal") 
with the same work or school email address that you used to install the gateway.

2. On the left menu in Azure, 
choose **New** > **Enterprise Integration** > **On-premises data gateway** as shown here:

   ![Find "On-premises data gateway"](./media/logic-apps-gateway-connection/find-on-premises-data-gateway.png)

3. On the **Create connection gateway** pane, 
provide these details about your data gateway connection:

   * **Name**: Enter a name for your data gateway connection. 

   * **Subscription**: Select the Azure subscription 
   that you want to associate with your data gateway connection.

   * **Resource Group**: Create a resource group 
   or select an existing resource group for managing 
   related Azure resources as a collection.

   * **Location**: Select the Azure datacenter region 
   where you want to create your resource.

      > [!NOTE] 
      > You can create and deploy the Azure gateway resource 
      > in a different datacenter region than your logic app. Previously, 
      > your gateway resource and logic app had to exist in 
      > the same region. Otherwise, your logic app couldn't access the gateway.

   * **Installation Name**: Select the data gateway 
   that you already installed.

   Then, to add gateway connection to your Azure dashboard, choose **Pin to dashboard**. 
   When you're done, choose **Create**.

   For example:
   
	![Provide details to create your on-premises data gateway](./media/logic-apps-gateway-connection/createblade.png)

### 3. Create a connection between your logic app and the data gateway

Now that you've associated your Azure subscription with an instance of the on-premises data gateway, 
create a connection between your logic and the data gateway instance.

1. In the Azure portal, open your logic app in Logic App Designer. 
2. Add a connector that supports on-premises connections, like SQL Server.
3. As shown, select **Connect via on-premises data gateway**. 
Provide the required connection information, 
and select the gateway that you want to connect.
When you're done, choose **Create**.

   ![Create data gateway connection from a logic app](./media/logic-apps-gateway-connection/blankconnection.png)

Congratulations, your data gateway connection is now ready for your logic app to use.

## Edit your on-premises data gateway connection settings

After you add the data gateway connection to your logic app, 
you might have to adjust the settings for that connection.

**To find the data gateway connection**

* On the logic app blade, under **Development Tools**, select **API Connections**. 

   The **API Connections** pane shows all the API Connections associated with your logic app, 
   including your data gateway connection. To view and edit that connection's settings, 
   select that connection.

   ![Go to your logic app, select "API Connections"](./media/logic-apps-gateway-connection/logic-app-find-api-connections.png)

* Or, from the main Azure left menu, go to 
**More Services** > **Enterprise Integration** > **On-premises Data Gateways**.

   ![Go to "More services", "On-premises Data Gateways"](./media/logic-apps-gateway-connection/find-on-premises-data-gateway-enterprise-integration.png)

## Delete your on-premises data gateway resource

When you don't need your data gateway resource anymore, you can delete that resource.

1. From the main Azure left menu, go to **All resources**. 
2. Find and select your data gateway resource.
3. Choose **Overview**, and on the resource toolbar, choose **Delete**.
