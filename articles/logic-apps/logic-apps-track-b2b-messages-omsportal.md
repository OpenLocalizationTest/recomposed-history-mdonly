# Track B2B messages in the Operations Management Suite portal

When you set up B2B communication for your logic app 
between two running business processes or applications, 
those entities can exchange messages with each other. 
To check whether these messages are processed correctly, 
you can use the [Azure Log Analytics service](../log-analytics/log-analytics-overview.md) 
in the [Operations Management Suite (OMS) portal](../operations-management-suite/operations-management-suite-overview.md). 
Log Analytics monitors your cloud and on-premises environments to help you 
maintain their ability and performance. For example, you can use 
these web-based tracking capabilities to track your messages:

* Message count and status
* Acknowledgments status
* Correlate messages with acknowledgments
* Detailed error descriptions for failures
* Search capabilities

## Requirements

* An Azure account, if you don't have this already. You can 
[create a free account here](https://azure.microsoft.com/free).

* A logic app that's set up with monitoring and logging for debugging and diagnostics. 
Learn [how to create a logic app](logic-apps-create-a-logic-app.md) 
and [how to set up monitoring and logging for that logic app](logic-apps-monitor-your-logic-apps.md#azure-diagnostics-and-alerts).

* An integration account that's set up with monitoring and logging for debugging and diagnostics. 
Learn [how to create an integration account](logic-apps-enterprise-integration-create-integration-account.md) 
and [how to set up monitoring and logging for that account](logic-apps-monitor-b2b-message.md).

* An OMS workspace in Log Analytics, if you don't have this already. 
Learn [how to create this workspace](../log-analytics/log-analytics-get-started.md).

## Add the Logic Apps B2B solution to the Operations Management Suite portal

To have the OMS portal track B2B messages for your logic app, 
you must add the **Logic Apps B2B** solution to the the OMS portal. 
Learn more about [adding solutions to OMS](../log-analytics/log-analytics-get-started.md).

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), and choose **More Services**. 
Search for "log analytics", and then choose **Log Analytics** as shown here:

   ![Find Log Analytics](media/logic-apps-track-b2b-messages-omsportal/browseloganalytics.png)

2. Under **Log Analytics**, select your OMS workspace. If you don't already have this workspace, 
[create a workspace first](../log-analytics/log-analytics-get-started.md).

   ![Select your OMS workspace](media/logic-apps-track-b2b-messages-omsportal/selectla.png)

3. Choose **OMS Portal**.

   ![Choose OMS portal](media/logic-apps-track-b2b-messages-omsportal/omsportalpage.png)

4. After the Microsoft Operations Management Suite portal home page appears, 
choose **Solutions Gallery**.    

   ![Choose Solutions Gallery](media/logic-apps-track-b2b-messages-omsportal/omshomepage1.png)

5. Choose **Logic Apps B2B**.     

   ![Choose Logic Apps B2B](media/logic-apps-track-b2b-messages-omsportal/omshomepage2.png)

6. Under **Logic Apps B2B**, choose **Add**.

   ![Choose Add](media/logic-apps-track-b2b-messages-omsportal/omshomepage3.png)

   On the OMS home page, a new tile for **Logic Apps B2B Messages** now appears. 
   This tile updates the message count when your B2B messages are processed.

## Track message status and details in the Operations Management Suite portal

1. After your B2B messages are processed, you can view the status and details for those messages. 
On the OMS home page, choose the **Logic Apps B2B Messages** tile.

   ![Updated message count](media/logic-apps-track-b2b-messages-omsportal/omshomepage6.png)

   The status for AS2, X12, EDIFACT messages between your partners appear here. 
   This data is based on a single day.

   ![View message status](media/logic-apps-track-b2b-messages-omsportal/omshomepage5.png)

3. To view more details for a message type, 
choose the tile for **AS2**, **X12**, or **EDIFACT**. 

   The message list appears for the tile that you chose, for example: 

   ![View message list](media/logic-apps-track-b2b-messages-omsportal/as2messagelist.png)

   To find property descriptions for a message list, 
   see [Message list property descriptions](#message-list-property-descriptions).

4. To view all the actions that have the same run ID, 
   select a row in the message list.

5. On the **Log Search** page, you can now filter these actions by column, 
create queries manually, or [build them by adding filters](logic-apps-track-b2b-messages-omsportal-query-filter-control-number.md):

   1. To create queries manually on the **Log Search** page, 
   in the search box, enter `Type="AzureDiagnostics"` plus the 
   columns and values that you want to use as query filters.
