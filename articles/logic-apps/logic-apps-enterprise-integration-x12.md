# Enterprise integration with X12

## Prerequisites

Before you can exchange X12 messages, you must create an X12 agreement and store that agreement in your integration account. 
The following steps walk you through the process of creating an X12 agreement.

* An [integration account](../logic-apps/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-accounts.md) defined in your Azure subscription  
* At least two [partners](../logic-apps/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-partners.md) configured with EDI X12 qualifier under business identities.   
* Required [Schema](../logic-apps/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-schemas.md) to be uploaded to [integration account](../logic-apps/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-accounts.md)

## Create an X12 agreement

1.	Sign in to the [Azure portal](http://portal.azure.com "Azure portal"). 

2. From the left menu, select **More services**. 

	![Select "More services"](./media/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-x12/account-1.png)

3.	In the search box, type "integration" as your filter. 
In the results list, select **Integration Accounts**.  

	![Filter on "integration", select "Integration Accounts"](./media/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-x12/account-2.png)

3. Select the integration account where you want to add the certificate.

	![Select integration account for adding certificate](./media/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-x12/account-3.png)

4. Choose the **Agreements** tile. If you don't see the agreements tile, 
add the tile. 

	![Choose "Agreements" tile](./media/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-agreements/agreement-1.png)

5. In the Agreements blade that opens, choose **Add**.

	![Choose "Add"](./media/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-agreements/agreement-2.png)     

6. Under **Add**, enter a **Name** for your agreement. 
Select **X12** for the agreement type, then select the **Host Partner**, **Host Identity**, **Guest Partner**, and **Guest Identity**.

	![Provide agreement details](./media/logic-apps-enterprise-integration-x12/x12-1.png)  

	| Property | Description |
	| --- | --- |
	| Name |Name of the agreement |
	| Agreement Type | Should be X12 |
	| Host Partner |An agreement needs both a host and guest partner. The host partner represents the organization that is configuring the agreement |
	| Host Identity |An identifier for the host partner |
	| Guest Partner |An agreement needs both a host and guest partner. The guest partner represents the organization that's doing business with the host partner |
	| Guest Identity |An identifier for the guest partner |
	| Receive Settings |These properties apply to all messages received by an agreement |
	| Send Settings |These properties apply to all messages sent by an agreement |  

  > [!NOTE]
  > Resolution of X12 agreement depends on matching the sender qualifier and identifier, 
  > and the receiver qualifier and identifier defined in the partner and incoming message. 
  > If these values change for your partner, update the agreement too.

## Receive Settings

To specify how to handle messages received from your partner through this agreement, 
select **Receive Settings**. Configure these settings based on your agreement with your partner 
and on how you want to identify and handle incoming messages from your partner through this agreement. 

The Receive Settings control is organized into these sections: Identifiers, 
Acknowledgment, Schemas, Envelopes, Control Numbers, Validation, and Internal Settings, 
described here.
