# Create custom APIs as connectors for logic apps

Although Azure Logic Apps offers [100+ built-in connectors](../connectors/apis-list.md) 
that you can use in logic app workflows, you might want to call APIs, systems, 
and services that aren't available as connectors. You can create your own web APIs 
and REST APIs that provide actions and triggers to use in logic apps.

Other reasons for creating custom APIs to use with logic apps:

* Extend your current system integration and data integration workflows.
* Help customers use your service to manage professional or personal tasks.
* Expand the reach, discoverability, and use for your service.

Connectors are basically web APIs that use REST for pluggable interfaces, 
[Swagger metadata format](http://swagger.io/specification/) for documentation, 
and JSON as their data exchange format. 
Because connectors are REST APIs that communicate through HTTP endpoints, 
you can use any language, like .NET, Java, or Node.js, for building connectors.
You can host your APIs on [Azure App Service](../app-service/app-service-value-prop-what-is.md), 
a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offering that provides one of the best, easiest, 
and most scalable ways for API hosting. 

For custom APIs to work with logic apps, your API can provide 
[*actions*](./logic-apps-what-are-logic-apps.md#logic-app-concepts) 
that perform specific tasks in logic app workflows. Your API can also act as a 
[*trigger*](./logic-apps-what-are-logic-apps.md#logic-app-concepts) 
that starts a logic app workflow when new data or an event meets a specified condition. 
This topic describes common patterns that you can follow 
for building actions and triggers in your API, 
based on the behavior that you want your API to provide.

## Helpful tools

Your custom API works best with logic apps when your API also has a 
[Swagger document](http://swagger.io/specification/) 
that describes your API's operations and parameters.
Many libraries, like [Swashbuckle](https://github.com/domaindrivendev/Swashbuckle), 
can automatically generate the Swagger file for you. 
To annotate the Swagger file for display names, property types, and so on, 
you can also use [TRex](https://github.com/nihaue/TRex) 
so that your Swagger file also works well with logic apps.

<a name="actions"></a>

## Actions

Your custom API can provide [*actions*](./logic-apps-what-are-logic-apps.md#logic-app-concepts) 
that logic apps use to perform tasks. Each action maps to an operation in your API. 
The basic action is a controller that accepts HTTP requests and returns HTTP responses. 
The logic app workflow sends an HTTP request to your web app or API app, 
which then returns an HTTP response, along with content that the workflow can process.

For a standard action, you can write an HTTP request method in your API, 
expose that method through Swagger, and call your API directly with an 
[HTTP action](../connectors/connectors-native-http.md). 
By default, all the steps required for responding to the original request must finish within the 
[request timeout limit](./logic-apps-limits-and-config.md). 

![Standard action pattern](./media/logic-apps-create-api-app/standard-action.png)

To make a logic app wait while your API finishes longer-running tasks, 
you can use the [asynchronous pattern](#async-pattern) 
or the [webhook pattern](#webhook-actions) described in this topic. 
For samples, visit the [Logic Apps GitHub repository](https://github.com/logicappsio). 

<a name="async-pattern"></a>

### Handle long-running actions with the asynchronous pattern

To have your API perform tasks that could take longer than the 
[request timeout limit](./logic-apps-limits-and-config.md), 
you can use the asynchronous pattern. This approach has 
your API do work in a separate thread, 
but keep an active connection to the Logic Apps engine. 
That way, the logic app doesn't time out or continue its 
workflow before your API finishes working.

Here's the general pattern:

1. Make sure that the engine knows that your API is still working.
2. Let the engine know when your API finishes the task.
3. Return relevant data to the engine so that the logic app workflow can continue.

![Asynchronous action pattern](./media/logic-apps-create-api-app/async-pattern-custom-api-actions.png)

Here are the specific steps for your API to follow, 
described from the API's perspective:

1. When your API gets an HTTP request to start work, 
immediately return an HTTP `202 ACCEPTED` response with the 
`location` header described later in this step. 
This response lets the Logic Apps engine know that your API got the request, 
accepted the request payload (data input), and is now processing. 
   
   The `202 ACCEPTED` response should include these headers:
   
   * *Required*: A `location` header that specifies the absolute path 
   to a URL where the Logic Apps engine can check your API's job status

   * *Optional*: A `retry-after` header that specifies the number of seconds 
   that the engine should wait before checking the `location` URL for job status. 

     By default, the engine checks every 20 seconds. To specify a different interval, 
     include the `retry-after` header and the number of seconds until the next poll.

2. After the specified time passes, the Logic Apps engine polls 
the `location` URL for job status. Your API should perform these 
checks and return these responses:
   
   * If the job is done, return an HTTP `200 OK` response, 
   along with the response payload (input for the next step).

   * If the job is still processing, return another HTTP `202 ACCEPTED` response, 
   but with the same headers as the original response.

When you use this pattern in your API, you don't have to do anything in the 
logic app workflow definition to continue checking job status. 
When the engine gets an HTTP `202 ACCEPTED` response and a 
valid `location` header, the engine respects the asynchronous pattern 
and checks the `location` header until your API returns a non-202 response.

For an example that shows this pattern, review this 
[asynchronous controller response sample in GitHub](https://github.com/logicappsio/LogicAppsAsyncResponseSample),

            }

            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Pause and wait with the webhook pattern

To make the Logic Apps engine pause and wait for your API to finish processing 
before continuing workflow, you can use the webhook pattern. 
A webhook is an HTTP "callback", which is an HTTP POST that sends 
a message to a URL when an event happens. For this pattern, set up 
two endpoints on your controller: `subscribe` and `unsubscribe`

*  `subscribe` endpoint: When execution reaches your API's action in the workflow, 
the Logic Apps engine calls the `subscribe` endpoint. 
The logic app creates and registers a callback URL, 
which your API stores, and waits for the callback from your API. 
When work is complete, your API calls back with an HTTP POST to the logic app. 
Any returned content and headers are passed as input for your logic app.

* `unsubscribe` endpoint: If the logic app run is canceled, 
the Logic Apps engine calls the `unsubscribe` endpoint. 
Your API can then unregister the callback URL and stop any processes as necessary.

For an example that shows the webhook pattern, review this 
[webhook sample in GitHub](https://github.com/logicappsio/LogicAppTriggersExample/blob/master/LogicAppTriggers/Controllers/WebhookTriggerController.cs).

<a name="triggers"></a>

## Triggers

Your custom API can also act as a [*trigger*](./logic-apps-what-are-logic-apps.md#logic-app-concepts) 
that starts a logic app when new data or an event meets a specified condition. 
A trigger can either check periodically, or wait and listen, for new data or events at an endpoint. 
If new data or an event meets the specified condition, the trigger fires and starts the 
logic app, which is also listening to that trigger. To start logic apps this way, 
have your API follow the *polling trigger* or *webhook trigger* pattern.

<a name="polling-triggers"></a>

### Polling trigger: check for new data or events

A *polling trigger* acts much like the [long-running asynchronous action](#async-pattern) 
previously described in this topic. The Logic Apps engine periodically calls and checks the trigger endpoint for new data or events. If the engine finds new data or an event that meets your specified condition, the trigger fires. Then, the engine creates a logic app instance that processes the data as input. To prevent processing the same data multiple times, the trigger should clean up data that was already read and passed to the logic app. 

Based on your App Service plan, this interval is 15 seconds for Premium plans, 
1 minute for Standard plans, and 1 hour for Free plans. Each polling request counts as an action execution, even when no logic app instance is created.

![Polling trigger pattern](./media/logic-apps-create-api-app/asyn-pattern-custom-api-triggers.png)

| Found new data or event? | API response | 
| ------------------------ | ------------ |
| Found | Return an HTTP `200 OK` status with the response payload (input for next step). <br/>This response creates a logic app instance and starts the workflow. |
| Not found | Return an HTTP `202 ACCEPTED` status with a `location` header and a `retry-after` header. <br/>For triggers, the `location` header should also contain a `triggerState` query parameter, which is usually a "timestamp." Your API can use this identifier to track the last time that the logic app was triggered. |

For example, to periodically check your service for new files, 
you might build a polling trigger that has these behaviors:

| Request includes `triggerState`? | API response |
| -------------------------------- | -------------|
| No | Return an HTTP `202 ACCEPTED` status plus a `location` header with `triggerState` set to the current time and the `retry-after` interval to 15 seconds. |
| Yes | Check your service for files added after the `DateTime` for `triggerState`. |

| # files found | API response |
| ------------- | -------------|
| Single file | Return an HTTP `200 OK` status and the content payload, update `triggerState` to the `DateTime` for the returned file, and set `retry-after` interval to 15 seconds. |
| Multiple files | Return one file at a time and an HTTP `200 OK` status, update `triggerState`, and set the `retry-after` interval to 0 seconds. </br>These steps let the engine know that more data is available, and that the engine should immediately request that data from the URL in the `location` header. |
| No files | Return an HTTP `202 ACCEPTED` status, don't change `triggerState`, and set the `retry-after` interval to 15 seconds. |

For an example that shows a polling trigger, review this 
[poll trigger controller sample in GitHub](https://github.com/logicappsio/LogicAppTriggersExample/blob/master/LogicAppTriggers/Controllers/PollTriggerController.cs).

<a name="webhook-triggers"></a>

### Webhook trigger: wait for new data or events

A webhook trigger is a *push trigger* that waits and listens for new data or 
events at a service endpoint. If new data or an event meets the specified condition, 
the trigger fires and creates a logic app instance, which then processes the data as input.
To prevent processing the same data multiple times, 
the trigger should clean up data that was already read and passed to the logic app.

Webhook triggers act much like the [webhook actions](#webhook-actions) previously 
described in this topic, and are set up with `subscribe` and `unsubscribe` endpoints. 

* `subscribe` endpoint: When you add and save a webhook trigger in your logic app, 
the Logic Apps engine calls the `subscribe` endpoint, and your API registers the callback URL. 
When there's new data or an event that meets the specified condition, 
your API calls back with an HTTP POST to the URL. 
The content payload and headers are passed to the logic app for use in the workflow.

* `unsubscribe` endpoint: If the webhook trigger or entire logic app is deleted, 
the Logic Apps engine calls the `unsubscribe` endpoint. 
Your API can then unregister the callback URL and stop any processes as necessary.
