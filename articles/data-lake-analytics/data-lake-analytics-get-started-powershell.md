# Tutorial: get started with Azure Data Lake Analytics using Azure PowerShell
[!INCLUDE [get-started-selector](../../includes/data-lake-analytics-selector-get-started.md)]

Learn how to use Azure PowerShell to create Azure Data Lake Analytics accounts and then submit and run U-SQL jobs. For more information about Data Lake Analytics, see [Azure Data Lake Analytics overview](data-lake-analytics-overview.md).

## Prerequisites

Before you begin this tutorial, you must have the following information:

* **An Azure Data Lake Analytics account**. See [Get started with Data Lake Analytics](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-lake-analytics/data-lake-analytics-get-started-portal).
* **A workstation with Azure PowerShell**. See [How to install and configure Azure PowerShell](/powershell/azure/overview).

## Preparing for the tutorial

The PowerShell snippets in this tutorial use these variables to store this information

```
$rg = "<ResourceGroupName>"
$adls = "<DataLakeStoreAccountName>"
$adla = "<DataLakeAnalyticsAccountName>"
$location = "East US 2"
```

## Get information about a Data Lake Analytics account

```
Get-AdlAnalyticsAccount -ResourceGroupName $rg -Name $adla  
```

## Submit a U-SQL job

Create a text file with following U-SQL script.

```
@a  = 
    SELECT * FROM 
        (VALUES
            ("Contoso", 1500.0),
            ("Woodgrove", 2700.0)
        ) AS 
              D( customer, amount );
OUTPUT @a
    TO "/data.csv"
    USING Outputters.Csv();
```

Submit the script.

```
Submit-AdlJob -AccountName $adla –ScriptPath "d:\test.usql"
```

## Monitor U-SQL Jobs

List all the jobs in the account. The output includes the currently running jobs and those jobs that have recently completed.

```
Get-AdlJob -Account $adla
```

Get the status of a specific job.

```
Get-AdlJob -AccountName $adla -JobId $job.JobId
```

Instead of calling Get-AdlAnalyticsJob over and over until a job finishes, you can use the Wait-AdlJob cmdlet.

```
Wait-AdlJob -Account $adla -JobId $job.JobId
```

After the job is completed, check if the output file exists by listing the files in a folder.

```
Get-AdlStoreChildItem -Account $adls -Path "/"
```

Check for the existence of a file.

```
Test-AdlStoreItem -Account $adls -Path "/data.csv"
```

## Uploading and Downloading files

Download the output of the U-SQL script.

```
Export-AdlStoreItem -AccountName $adls -Path "/data.csv"  -Destination "D:\data.csv"
```

Upload a file to be used as an unput to a U-SQL script.

```
Import-AdlStoreItem -AccountName $adls -Path "D:\data.tsv" -Destination "/data_copy.csv" 
```
