This tutorial shows you how to create an iOS app with Azure App Service Mobile Apps. You will create a new mobile app backend and a simple _To do list_ app that stores app data. The tutorial uses .NET and Visual Studio for server-side logic.

> [AZURE.NOTE] To complete this tutorial, you need an Azure account. If you don't have an account, you can sign up for an Azure trial and get [free mobile services](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/pricing/details/mobile-services/) that you can keep using even after your trial ends.  For details, see [Azure Free Trial](http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/pricing/free-trial/?WT.mc_id=AE564AB28&amp;returnurl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.windowsazure.com%2Fen-us%2Fdevelop%2Fmobile%2Ftutorials%2Fget-started-ios%2F%20target="_blank").

[AZURE.INCLUDE [app-service-mobile-dotnet-backend-create-new-service-preview](../includes/app-service-mobile-services-dotnet-backend-create-new-service-preview.md)]

## Download the mobile app backend and app to your local computer

Now that you have created the mobile app backend, download the projects to run them locally.

1. Click **Browse** on the left navigation, expand **Mobile Apps**, and click on the App Service Mobile App that you just created.

2. then in the Quick Start tab, click **iOS** under **Choose a platform** and expand **Create a new iOS app**.

2. On your Windows PC, click **Download** under **Download and publish your service to the cloud**. This downloads the Visual Studio project that implements your mobile service. Save the compressed project file to your local computer, and make a note of where you saved it.

3. On your Mac, click **Download** under **Download and run your app**. This downloads the project for the sample _To do list_ application that is connected to your mobile service, along with the Mobile Services iOS SDK. Save the compressed project file to your local computer, and make a note of where you saved it.

## Test the mobile service

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-dotnet-backend-test-local-service](../includes/mobile-services-dotnet-backend-test-local-service.md)]

## Publish your mobile service

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-dotnet-backend-publish-service](../includes/mobile-services-dotnet-backend-publish-service.md)]


## Run your new iOS app

[AZURE.INCLUDE [mobile-services-ios-run-app](../includes/mobile-services-ios-run-app.md)]

This shows how to run your new client app against the mobile service running in Azure. Before you can test the iOS app with the mobile service running on a local computer, you must configure the Web server and firewall to allow access from your iOS development computer. For more information, see [Configure the local web server to allow connections to a local mobile service](/en-us/documentation/articles/mobile-services-dotnet-backend-how-to-configure-iis-express).
