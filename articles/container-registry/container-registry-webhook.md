# Using Azure Container Registry webhooks - Azure Portal

An Azure container registry stores and manages private Docker container images, similar to the way Docker Hub stores public Docker images. You use webhooks to trigger events when certain actions take place in one of your registry repositories. Webhooks can respond to events at the registry level or they can be scoped down to a specific repository tag. 

For more background and concepts, see the [overview](./container-registry-intro.md)

## Prerequisites 

- Azure container registry - Create a container registry in your Azure subscription. For example, use the Azure portal, the Azure CLI 2.0, or PowerShell. 
- Docker CLI - To set up your local computer as a Docker host and access the Docker CLI commands, install Docker Engine. 
 
!! Note: Webhooks are not available for the Basic tier of Container Registries. 

## Create webhook Azure Portal

1. Log in to the Azure Portal and navigate to the registry in which you want to create webhooks. 

2. In the container blade, select the "Webhooks" tab. 

3. Select "add" from the webhook blade toolbar 

4. Complete the *Create Webhook* form with the following information:

- **Name**: the name you want to give to the webhook. It can only contain lowercase letters and numbers and between 5-50 characters. 
- **Service URI**: the URI where the webhook should send POST notifications. 
- **Custom headers**: headers you want to pass along with the POST request. They should value a "key: value" format.
- **Trigger actions**: actionsthat will trigger the webhook. Currently webhooks can be triggered by push and/or delete actions to an image. 
- **Status**: the status for the webhook after it's created. It's enabled by default. 
- **Scope**: the scope at which the webhook will work. By default the scope is for all events in the registry. It can be specified for a repository or a tag by using the format "repository: tag".

> [!NOTE]
> Curranty the request body cannot be modified. If the specified service URI requires a body in a specific format, a conversion mechanism will need to be used.

## Test webhook

Prior to using the webhook on container image push and delete actions, it can be tested using the **Ping** button. When used, the Ping sends a generic post request to the specified endpoint and logs the response. This is helpful to verify that the webhook has been set up correctly.

1. Select the webhook you want to test. 
2. In the top toolbar select the "Ping" action. 
3. Check the request and response.

## Delete webhook

Each webhook can be deleted by selecting the webhook and then the delete button on the Azure portal.
