# Push notifications to users by using Mobile Services

This topic has been deprecated. Instead, please follow the updated guidance in these tutorials:

+ [Add push notifications to your Mobile Services app](/en-us/documentation/articles/mobile-services-javascript-backend-windows-phone-get-started-push/)<br/>Update your TodoList mobile service to use Azure Notification Hubs to send notifications to users of the TodoList sample app.
+ [Send push notifications to authenticated users](/en-us/documentation/articles/mobile-services-javascript-backend-windows-phone-push-notifications-app-users/)<br/>Extends the previous tutorial to only allow signed-in users to register for notifications.
