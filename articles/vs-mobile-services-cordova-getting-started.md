### What Happened?

###References Added

The Azure Mobile Service Client plugin included with all Multi-Device Hybrid Apps has been enabled.
  
###Connection string values for Mobile Services

Under services\mobileServices\settings, a new JavaScript (.js) file with a MobileServiceClient was generated containing the selected mobile serviceâ€™s application URL and application key. The file contains the initialization of a mobile service client object, similar to the following code.

	var mobileServiceClient;
	document.addEventListener("deviceready", function() {
            mobileServiceClient = new WindowsAzure.MobileServiceClient(
	        "<your mobile service name>.azure-mobile.net",
	        "<insert your key>"
	    );
  
### Getting Started with Mobile Services

######Get reference to a table

The following code gets a reference to a table that contains data for a TodoItem, which you can use in subsequent operations to read and update the data table. The TodoItem table is created automatically when you create a mobile service.

	var todoTable = mobileServiceClient.getTable('TodoItem');

For these examples to work, permissions on the table must be set to **Anybody with an Application Key**. Later, you can set up authentication. See [Get started with authentication](http://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/documentation/articles/mobile-services-html-get-started-users/).

######Add entry 

Insert a new item into a data table. An id (a GUID of type string) is automatically created as the primary key for the new row. Call the [done]() method on the returned [Promise]() object to get a copy of the inserted object and handle any errors.

    function TodoItem(text) {
        this.text = text;
        this.complete = false;
    }

    var items = new Array();
    todoTable.insert(todoItem).done(function (item) {
        items.push(item)
        });
    };

######Read/query table 

The following code queries a table for all items, sorted by the text field. You can add code to process the query results in the success handler. In this case, a local array of the items is updated.

    todoTable.orderBy('text')
        .read().done(function (results) {
            items = results.slice();
            });
        });

You can use the where method to modify the query. Here's an example that filters out completed items.

	todoTable.where(function () {
                 return (this.complete === false);
              })
             .read().done(function (results) {
                items = results.slice();
             });

For more examples of queries you can use, see [query]((http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/azure/jj613353.aspx)) object.

######Update entry

Update a row in a data table. In this code, when the mobile service responds, the item is removed from the list. Call the [done]() method on the returned [Promise]() object to get a copy of the inserted object and handle any errors.

    todoTable.update(todoItem).done(function (item) {
        // Update a local collection of items.
        items.splice(items.indexOf(todoItem), 1, item);
    });

######Delete entry

Delete a row in a data table using the del method. Call the [done]() method on the returned [Promise]() object to get a copy of the inserted object and handle any errors.

	todoTable.del(todoItem).done(function (item) {
        items.splice(items.indexOf(todoItem), 1);
	});
