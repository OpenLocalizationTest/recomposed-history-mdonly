# Trace usage and events in your web app with Application Insights API

*Application Insights is in preview.*

Insert a few lines of code in your web application to find out what users are doing with it. You can track events, metrics, and page views.

## <a name="clientServer"></a> Client and server tracking

You can send telemetry from the client (web page) or the server sides of your app, or both.

The client and server APIs are very similar. You can send the same types of telemetry both from your users' web browsers, and from your web server. The difference is in the scope of the data you can send.

* Tracking at the web client is particularly useful if you have richly active web pages with lots of JavaScript. For example, you could monitor how frequently users click a particular button or how often they encounter validation errors.
* Tracking at the web server is more useful for monitoring business metrics and events such as the value of a customer's shopping cart or the count of abandoned orders.

In a typical ASP.NET web application, you have the default JavaScript call to trackPageView() in the web master page, and you'll add some calls to track events and metrics in the server code. If your client-side code is quite rich, you might also add some calls to track events and metrics at the client.


## <a name="prep"></a>Before you start

If you haven't done these yet:

* To get telemetry from an ASP.NET web app:

    [Add Application Insights to your project][greenbrown]

    In your web server code, include:

        (C#) `using Microsoft.ApplicationInsights;`

	    (VB) `Imports Microsoft.ApplicationInsights`

* [Set up web client analytics][usage]. The JavaScript initialization code should be included in every web page where you want to write monitoring code, or in a master page. 

    If it's working, you should see data in on the Overview blade under Usage Analytics.

When you run your app on your development machine in debug mode, results will appear in Application Insights within seconds. When you deploy the app, data takes longer to move through the pipeline from your server and clients.


## <a name="pageViews"></a>Page views (client only)

By default, the initialization script in the head of the web page logs a page view, naming the event with the relative URL of the page. These calls provide the basic page use statistics. 

![Usage lens on Overview blade](./media/appinsights/appinsights-47usage-2.png)

#### Custom page data

You can modify the call to change the name, or you can insert additional calls. For example, if your single-page web app displays multiple blades or tabs, you might want to record a page view when the user switches to a different tab. For example:

JavaScript at client:

    appInsights.trackPageView("tab1");

If you have several tabs within different HTML pages, you can specify the URL too:

    appInsights.trackPageView("tab1", "http://fabrikam.com/page1.htm");

## <a name="events"></a>Track events

Send custom events from your app to better understand your users' experience - for example to log how often games are won or lost, the frequency of invalid entries, and so on. 

JavaScript at client

    appInsights.trackEvent("WinsGame");

C# at server
    
    var telemetry = new TelemetryClient();
    telemetry.TrackEvent("WinGame");

VB at server


    Dim telemetry = New TelemetryClient
    telemetry.TrackEvent("WinGame")

If you send telemetry from both the client and server, be sure to give the events different names.

The top events show up on the overview blade:

Click through to see an overview chart and a complete list.

Select the chart and segment it by Event name to see the relative contributions of the most significant events.

![](./media/appinsights/appinsights-23-customevents-2.png)

From the list below the chart, select an event name to see individual occurrences of the event.

## <a name="properties"></a>Filter, search and segment your data with properties

You can attach properties and measurements to your events, page views, and other telemetry data. 

**Properties** are string values that you can use to filter your telemetry in the usage reports. For example if your app provides several games, youâ€™ll want to attach the name of the game to each event, so that you can see which games are more popular.

**Measurements** are numeric values that you can get statistics from in the usage reports.


JavaScript at client

    appInsights.trackEvent("WinGame",
         // String properties:
         {Game: currentGame.name, Difficulty: currentGame.difficulty},
         // Numeric measurements:
         {Score: currentGame.score, Opponents: currentGame.opponentCount}
         );

C# at server

    // Set up some properties:
    var properties = new Dictionary <string, string> 
       {{"game", currentGame.Name}, {"difficulty", currentGame.Difficulty}};
    var measurements = new Dictionary <string, double>
       {{"Score", currentGame.Score}, {"Opponents", currentGame.OpponentCount}};

    // Send the event:
    telemetry.TrackEvent("WinGame", properties, measurements);


VB at server

    ' Set up some properties:
    Dim properties = New Dictionary (Of String, String)
    properties.Add("game", currentGame.Name)
    properties.Add("difficulty", currentGame.Difficulty)

    Dim measurements = New Dictionary (Of String, Double)
    measurements.Add("Score", currentGame.Score)
    measurements.Add("Opponents", currentGame.OpponentCount)

    ' Send the event:
    telemetry.TrackEvent("WinGame", properties, measurements)


Attach properties to page views in the same way:

JavaScript at client

    appInsights.trackPageView("Win", 
     {Game: currentGame.Name}, 
     {Score: currentGame.Score});


> [AZURE.NOTE] Take care not to log personally identifiable information in properties.

In Diagnostic Search, view the properties by clicking through an individual occurrence of an event.

Use the Search field to see event occurrences with a particular property value.

## Timed page views and events

You can attach timing data to events and page views. Instead of calling trackEvent or trackPageView, use these calls:

JavaScript at client

    // At the start of the game:
    appInsights.startTrackEvent(game.id);

    // At the end of the game:
    appInsights.stopTrackEvent(game.id, {GameName: game.name}, {Score: game.score});

    // At the start of a page view:
    appInsights.startTrackPage(myPage.name);

    // At the completion of a page view:
    appInsights.stopTrackPage(myPage.name, "http://fabrikam.com/page", properties, measurements);

Use the same string as the first parameter in the start and stop calls.

## <a name="defaults"></a>Set default property values (not at web client)

You can set default values in a TelemetryContext. They are attached to every metric and event sent from the context. 
    

C# at server

    using Microsoft.ApplicationInsights.DataContracts;

    var context = new TelemetryContext();
    context.Properties["Game"] = currentGame.Name;
    var telemetry = new TelemetryClient(context);
    // Now all telemetry will automatically be sent with the context property:
    telemetry.TrackEvent("WinGame");
    
VB at server

    Dim context = New TelemetryContext
    context.Properties("Game") = currentGame.Name
    Dim telemetry = New TelemetryClient(context)
    ' Now all telemetry will automatically be sent with the context property:
    telemetry.TrackEvent("WinGame")

    
    
Individual telemetry can override the default values.

You can set up a universal initializer so that all new TelemetryClients automatically use your context.

    // Telemetry initializer class
    public class MyTelemetryInitializer : IContextInitializer
    {
        public void Initialize (TelemetryContext context)
        {
            context.Properties["AppVersion"] = "v2.1";
        }
    }

In the app initializer such as Global.asax.cs:

    protected void Application_Start()
    {
        // ...
        TelemetryConfiguration.Active.ContextInitializers
        .Add(new MyTelemetryInitializer());
    }
