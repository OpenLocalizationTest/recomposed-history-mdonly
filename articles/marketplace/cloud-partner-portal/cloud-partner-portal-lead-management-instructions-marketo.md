7. You will see an embed code similar to this sample below: 

   ` <script src="//app-ys12.marketo.com/js/forms2/js/forms2.min.js"></script>`

    `<form id="mktoForm_1179"></form> `

    `<script>MktoForms2.loadForm("("//app-ys12.marketo.com", "123-PQR-789", 1179);</script>`

8. Use the values available in the embed code to fill <b>Server Id, Munchkin Id, and Form Id</b> in the Marketo fields on the Cloud Partner Portal. <br\> <br/>

  The following sample will help you determine the Ids from sample data above. <br\>

  serverId = **ys12** <br\>

 munchkinId = **123-PQR-789** <br\>

 formId = **1179** <br\> <br/>
