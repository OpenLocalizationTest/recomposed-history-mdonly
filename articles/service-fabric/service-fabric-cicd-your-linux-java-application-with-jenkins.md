# Build and deploy your Linux Java application using Jenkins
Jenkins is a popular tool for continuous integration and deployment. In this document, we walk you through building and deploying your Service Fabric application using Jenkins.

## General Prerequisites
1. Have git installed locally. You can install the appropriate git version from [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads) based on your OS. If you are new to git, you can follow the steps mentioned in the [documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs) to get yourself acquainted with git.
2. Have the Service Fabric Jenkins plugin handy. Download the Service Fabric Jenkins plugin from [here](https://servicefabricdownloads.blob.core.windows.net/jenkins/serviceFabric.hpi).

## Setting up Jenkins inside a Service Fabric cluster

### Prerequisites
1. Have a Service Fabric Linux cluster ready. Service Fabric cluster created from Azure portal already has Docker installed. If you are running the cluster locally, check if Docker is installed or not using the command ``docker info`` and if it is not installed, then install it accordingly using the following commands:

  ```sh
  sudo apt-get install wget
  wget -qO- https://get.docker.io/ | sh
  ```
2. Have the Service Fabric container application deployed on the cluster using the following steps:

  ```sh
git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/service-fabric-java-getting-started.git -b JenkinsDocker
cd service-fabric-java-getting-started/Services/JenkinsDocker/
azure servicefabric cluster connect http://PublicIPorFQDN:19080   # Azure CLI cluster connect command
bash Scripts/install.sh
```
This installs Jenkins container on the cluster and can be monitored using the Service Fabric explorer.

### Steps
1. Go to the URL ``http://PublicIPorFQDN:8081`` from your browser. It provides the path of the initial admin password required to log in. You can continue to use Jenkins as admin user or you can create and change the user, once you log in with the initial admin account.

  > [!NOTE]
  > You need to ensure 8081 port is specified as application endpoint port while creating the cluster
  >

2. Get the container instance id using ``docker ps -a``.
3. SSH login to the container and paste the path you were shown on the Jenkins portal. For example, if in the portal it shows the path `PATH_TO_INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD`, you can do -

  ```sh
  docker exec -t -i [first-four-digits-of-container-ID] /bin/bash   # This takes you inside Docker shell
  cat PATH_TO_INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD
  ```

4. Set up GitHub to work with Jenkins using the steps mentioned at the [link](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/).
	* Use the instructions provided from GitHub to generate the SSH key and add the SSH key to the GitHub account that is hosting your repository.
	* Run the commands mentioned in the preceding link in the Jenkins Docker shell (and not on your host)
	* To log on to the Jenkins shell from your host, use the following command:

  ```sh
  docker exec -t -i [first-four-digits-of-container-ID] /bin/bash
  ```

## Setting up Jenkins outside a Service Fabric cluster

### Prerequisites
You need to have Docker installed. The following commands can be used to install Docker from terminal:

  ```sh
  sudo apt-get install wget
  wget -qO- https://get.docker.io/ | sh
  ```

Now when you run ``docker info`` in the terminal, you should see in the output that Docker service is running.

### Steps
  1. Pull the Service Fabric Jenkins container image: ``docker pull servicefabric-microsoft.azurecr.io/jenkins:v1``
  2. Run the container image: ``docker run -itd -p 8080:8080 servicefabric-microsoft.azurecr.io/jenkins:v1``
  3. Get the id the container image instance. You can list all the Docker containers with the command ``docker ps â€“a``
  4. Log in to Jenkins portal using the following steps:

    * ```sh
    docker exec [first-four-digits-of-container-ID] cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword
    ```
    If container id is 2d24a73b5964, use 2d24.
    * This password is required for logging in to the Jenkins dashboard from portal, which is ``http://<HOST-IP>:8080``
    * Once you log in for the first time, you can create your own user-account and use that for future purpose or you can continue to use the administrator account. Once you create a user, you need to continue with that.
  5. Set up GitHub to work with Jenkins using the steps mentioned at the [link](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/).
  	* Use the instructions provided from GitHub to generate the SSH key and add the ssh key to the GitHub account which is (would be) hosting the repository.
  	* Run the commands mentioned in the preceding link in the Jenkins Docker shell (and not on your host)
  	* To log on to the Jenkins shell from your host, use the following commands:

      ```sh
      docker exec -t -i [first-four-digits-of-container-ID] /bin/bash
      ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > Ensure that the cluster / machine where the Jenkins container image is hosted has a public facing IP such that notifications from GitHub are received by the Jenkins instance.

## Install the Service Fabric Jenkins plugin from portal

1. Go to ``http://PublicIPorFQDN:8081``
2. From the Jenkins dashboard, select ``Manage Jenkins`` -> ``Manage Plugins`` -> ``Advanced``.
Here, you can upload a plugin. Select the ``Choose file`` option, then select the serviceFabric.hpi file, which you downloaded under prerequisites. Once you select upload, Jenkins automatically installs the plugin. Allow a restart if requested.

## Creating and configuring a Jenkins job

1. Create a ``new item`` from dashboard
2. Enter an item name - say ``MyJob``, select free-style project, and click ok
3. Then go the job page and click ``Configure`` -
  * In the general section, under ``Github project`` specify your GitHub project URL, which hosts the Service Fabric Java application that you wish to integrate with the Jenkins CI/CD flow (for example - ``https://github.com/sayantancs/SFJenkins``).
  * Under the ``Source Code Management`` section, select ``Git``. Specify the repository URL which hosts the Service Fabric Java application that you wish to integrate with the Jenkins CI/CD flow (for example - ``https://github.com/sayantancs/SFJenkins.git``). Also you can specify here which branch to build, example - ``*/master``.
4. Configure your *GitHub* (which is hosting the repository) so that it is able to talk to Jenkins, using the following steps -
  1. Go to your GitHub repository page. Go to ``Settings`` -> ``Integrations and Services``.
  2. Select ``Add Service``, type in Jenkins, select the ``Jenkins-Github plugin``.
  3. Enter your Jenkins webhook URL (by default, it should be ``http://<PublicIPorFQDN>:8081/github-webhook/``). Click add/update service.
  4. A test event is sent to your Jenkins instance. You should see a green check by the webhook in GitHub, and your project will build!
  5. Under the ``Build Triggers`` section, select which build option do you want - for this use case we plan to trigger a build whenever some push to the repository happens - so the corresponding option would be - ``GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling`` (previously it was 'Build when a change is pushed to GitHub')
  6. Under the ``Build section`` - from the drop-down ``Add build step``, select the option ``Invoke Gradle Script``. In the widget that comes, specify the path to ``Root build script``, for your application. It picks up the build.gradle from the path specified and works accordingly. If you create a project named ``MyActor``(using Eclipse plugin or Yeoman generator), then the root build script should contain - ``${WORKSPACE}/MyActor``. As an example, this section mostly looks like -

    ![Service Fabric Jenkins Build action][build-step]
  7. Under the ``Post-Build Actions`` drop-down, select ``Deploy Service Fabric Project``. Here you need to provide cluster details where the Jenkins compiled Service Fabric application would be deployed and additional application details used to deploy the application. Following screenshot can be used as a reference:

    ![Service Fabric Jenkins Build action][post-build-step]

 > [!NOTE]
 > The cluster here could be same as the one hosting the Jenkins container application in case you are using Service Fabric to deploy the Jenkins container image.
 >

### End to end scenario
By now, your GitHub and Jenkins are configured and you can now make some sample change in your ``MyActor`` project in the repository example https://github.com/sayantancs/SFJenkins and push your changes to remote ``master`` branch (or any branch that you have configured to work with). This would trigger the Jenkins job ``MyJob``, you configured. What it would do is basically - fetch the changes from GitHub, build them and deploy the application to the cluster endpoint you specified in post-build actions.
