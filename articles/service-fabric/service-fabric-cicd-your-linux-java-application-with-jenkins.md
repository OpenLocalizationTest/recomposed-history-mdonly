# Build and deploy your Linux Java application using Jenkins
Jenkins is one of the hugely used continuous integration and deployment tools, which is used by the developers. Here we have a similar provision with Jenkins such that, once you have your service-fabric application ready, you can build and deploy

## General Prerequisites
1. You need to have git installed locally, as you would see later in the tutorial.
2. You need to have the service-fabric jenkins plugin handy. In case you do not have it, try downloading it from [here](https://servicefabricdownloads.blob.core.windows.net/jenkins/serviceFabric.hpi).

## Setting up Jenkins using Service Fabric as the Container Orchestrator

### Prerequisites
1. You have a Service Fabric Linux Cluster ready (probably created from Azure portal directly), say ``http://SOME-IP:19080``. Service Fabric clusters created from azure portal already has docker installed but usually azure VMs do not. Check if docker is installed or not using the command ``docker info`` and if it is not installed then install it accordingly using -
<br/>`` sudo apt-get install wget``
<br/>`` wget -qO- https://get.docker.io/ | sh``
<br/>
2. Have the Service Fabric Container application deployed on the cluster ``http://SOME-IP:19080``. You can follow the steps below -
  - Do - ``git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/service-fabric-java-getting-started.git -b JenkinsDocker && cd service-fabric-java-getting-started/Services/JenkinsDocker/``
  - Connect to the Service Fabric cluster ``http://SOME-IP:19080`` using azure-cli - ``azure servicefabric cluster connect http://SOME-IP:19080``
  - Run ``./install.sh``. It will install the Jenkins container to the cluster you connected. You can monitor your container app using the ususal service-fabric explorer - ``http://SOME-IP:19080``.

### Steps
1. Go to the URL ``http://SOME-IP:8081`` from your browser. It will display you from where you will get the initial-admin password required to login to the Jenkins portal, where you can change it and configure Jenkins.
2. Now first get the container instance id using ``docker ps -a``. At this point, you can ssh login to the container using ``docker exec -t -i [first-four-digits-of-container-ID] /bin/bash `` and paste the path you were shown in portal here.
3. The step of integrating it with github etc, will be same as point #5 of last section.
4. Setup github to work with Jenkins using [this](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/).
	* Then, use the instructions provided from Github to generate the SSH key and add the ssh key to the github-account which is (would be) hosting the repository.
	* You need to run the commands mentioned in the above link in the Jenkins-docker shell (and not on your host)
	* To log on to the Jenkins shell from your host, you need to do - ``docker exec -t -i [first-four-digits-of-container-ID] /bin/bash ``

## Setting up Jenkins as a Stand-alone Container

### Prerequisites
1. You need to have docker installed. If not you can type in the following commands in the terminal to install docker.
<br/>`` sudo apt-get install wget``
<br/>`` wget -qO- https://get.docker.io/ | sh``
<br/> Now when you run ``docker info`` in the terminal, you would see in the output that docker service is running.

### Steps
  1. Pull the docker container image: ``docker pull IMAGE_NAME ``
  2. Run the container-image: ``docker run -itd -p 8080:8080 IMAGE_NAME``
  3. Get the id of your docker container which has the jenkins image (which you just installed). You can list all the docker containers with the command ``docker ps â€“a``
  4. Get the admin password for the Jenkins account. For that you can do the following -
    * ``docker exec [first-four-digits-of-container-ID] cat /var/jenkins_home/secrets/initialAdminPassword``, Here if container id is 2d24a73b5964, you need to insert just 2d24
    * This password will be required for logging into the Jenkins dashboard from portal which is ``http://<HOST-IP>:8080``
    * Once you login for the first time, you can create your own user-account and use that for future purpose or you can continue to use the administrator account. But once you create a new user, you need to continue with that.
  5. Setup github to work with Jenkins using [this](https://help.github.com/articles/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent/).
  	* Then, use the instructions provided from Github to generate the SSH key and add the ssh key to the github-account which is (would be) hosting the repository.
  	* You need to run the commands mentioned in the above link in the Jenkins-docker shell (and not on your host)
  	* To log on to the Jenkins shell from your host, you need to do - ``docker exec -t -i [first-four-digits-of-container-ID] /bin/bash ``

## Install the service-fabric Jenkins Plugin from portal

1. Go to ``http://SOME-IP:8081``
2. From the Jenkins dashboard, select ``Manage Jenkins`` -> ``Manage Plugins`` -> ``Advanced``.
Here, you can upload a plugin. Select the ``Choose file`` option, then select the serviceFabric.hpi file, which you have downloaded under Prerequisites. Once you select upload, Jenkins will automatically install the plugin for you. It might also ask for a restart, please allow it.

## Creating and configuring a Jenkins job

1. Create a ``new item`` from dashboard
2. Enter a new item name - say ``MyJob``, select free-style project and click ok
3. Then go the job page and click ``Configure`` -
  * In the general section, under ``Github project``, give the project url e.g. - ``https://github.com/sayantancs/SFJenkins``
  * Under the ``Source Code Management`` Section, select ``Git``. Give the repository URL, e.g. - ``https://github.com/sayantancs/SFJenkins.git``. Also you can specify which branch to build, e.g. - ``*/master``.
4. You need to configure your *Github* (i.e. which is hosting the repository) so that it is able to talk to Jenkins. For this you need to do the following steps -
  - Go to your Github repository page. Go to ``Settings`` -> ``Integrations and Services``.
  - Select ``Add Service``, type in Jenkins, select the ``Jenkins-Github plugin``.
  - Enter your Jenkins webhook URL (by default, it should be ``http://<SOME-IP>:8081/github-webhook/``). Click on add/update service.
  - A test event will be sent to your Jenkins instance. You should see a green check by the webhook in Github, and your project will build!
  - Under the ``Build Triggers`` section select which build option do you want - for this use-case we plan to trigger a build whenever some push to the repo happens - so the corresponding option would be - ``GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling`` (previously it was 'Build when a change is pushed to Github')
  - Under the ``Build section`` - from the drop-down ``Add build step``, select the option ``Invoke Gradle Script``. In the widget that comes, specify the path to ``Root build script``, for your application. It picks up the build.gradle from the path specified and works accordingly. Please note that - if you create a project named ``MyActor``(using Eclipse plugin or Yeoman generator), then the root-build-script should contain - ``${WORKSPACE}/MyActor``. As an example, this section mostly looks like -

    ![Service Fabric Jenkins Build action][build-step]
  - Under the ``Post-Build Actions`` drop-down, select ``Deploy Service Fabric Project``. Here you need to provide the details like - Application Name, Application Type, Application manifest Path, cluster-IP, cluster-type etc. Please fill in the details accordingly. You might want to have a look at the following handy screen-shot as a reference -

    ![Service Fabric Jenkins Build action][post-build-step]

### End to end scenario
Given you now have your github and Jenkins are all set and integrated, you can make some sample change in your ``MyActor`` project in the repository e.g. https://github.com/sayantancs/SFJenkins and push your changes to remote ``master`` branch(or any branch that you have configured to work with). This will now trigger the Jenkins job ``MyJob``, you configured. What it would do is basically - fetch the changes from github, build them and deploy the application to the cluster endpoint you specified in post-build actions.  

  > [!NOTE]
  > You should keep in mind that the service-fabric cluster where you deployed your container application, must have a public-facing IP (this can be a SF cluster created from azure portal or one-box cluster created on an azure VM). Else, if the cluster is under some corpnet-proxy, then Github would not be able to talk to the Jenkins instance.
