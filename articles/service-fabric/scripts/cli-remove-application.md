# Remove an application from a Service Fabric cluster

This sample script deletes a running Service Fabric application instance, unregisters an application type and version from the cluster.  Deleting the application instance also deletes all the running service instances associated with that application. Next, the application files are deleted from the image store. 

If needed, install the [Azure CLI](../service-fabric-azure-cli-2-0.md).

## Sample script

[!code-cli[main](../../../cli_scripts/service-fabric/remove-application/remove-application.sh "Remove an application from a cluster")]

## Script explanation

This script uses the following commands. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.

| Command | Notes |

| [sf cluster select](/cli/azure/sf/cluster#select) | Selects the cluster to work with. |
| [sf application delete](/cli/azure/sf/application#delete) | Deletes the application instance from the cluster. |
| [sf application unprovision](/cli/azure/sf/application#unprovision) | Unregisters a Service Fabric application type and version from the cluster.|
| [sf application package-delete](/cli/azure/sf/application#package-delete) | Removes a Service Fabric application package from the image store. |
