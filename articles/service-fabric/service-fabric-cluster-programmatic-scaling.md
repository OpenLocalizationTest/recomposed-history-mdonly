Fundamentals of scaling a Service Fabric cluster are covered in documentation on [cluster scaling](/service-fabric-cluster-scale-up-down.md). That article explained how Service Fabric clusters are built on top of virtual machine scale sets and can be scaled either manually or with auto-scale rules. This document looks at programmatic methods to coordinate scaling operations for more advanced scenarios. 

## Reasons for programmatic scaling
In some scenarios, scaling manually or via auto-scale rules will be good solutions. In other scenarios, though, they may not be the right fit. Potential drawbacks to these approaches include:

- Manually scaling, of course, requires a user to login and explicitly request scaling operations. If scaling operations are required frequently or at unpredictable times, this may not be a good fit.
- When auto-scale rules remove an instance from a VM Scale Set, they will not automatically remove knowledge of that node from the associated Service Fabric cluster. Because auto-scale rules work at the VMSS level (rather than at the Service Fabric level), auto-scale rules can remove Service Fabric nodes without shutting them down gracefully and will leave 'ghost' Service Fabric node state behind after scale-in operations. An individual (or a service) will need to periodically clean up removed node state in the Service Fabric cluster.
2. Although there are [many](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/monitoring-and-diagnostics/insights-autoscale-common-metrics) metrics supported by autoscale rules, it is still a limited set and if your scenario calls for scaling based on some metric not covered in that set, then autoscale rules may not be a good fit.

Based on these limitations, some users may wish to implement more customized automatic scaling models. 

## Programmatic scaling
Azure APIs exist which allow applications to programmatically work with VM Scale Sets and Service Fabric clusters. Using these APIs, it's possible to write custom scaling logic if existing autoscale infrastructure won't work for one reason or another. 

One way to implement this 'home-made' auto-scaling functionality is by adding a new stateless service to the Service Fabric application which would be responsible for scaling operations. Within the service's `RunAsync` method, a set of triggers can be checked to determine if scaling is required (as well as checking parameters such as maximum cluster size and scaling cooldowns).   

The API used for VM Scale Set interactions (both to check the current number of instances and to modify it) is the fluent [Azure Management Compute library](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Azure.Management.Compute.Fluent/1.0.0-beta50). The fluent compute library provides an easy-to-use API for interacting with Scale Sets.

To interact with the Service Fabric cluster itself, use [System.Fabric.FabricClient](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.fabric.fabricclient).

Of course, the scaling code doesn't need to run as a service in the cluster to be scaled - it could just as easily be a stand-alone application, if desired. Both `IAzure` and `FabricClient` can connect to their associated Azure resources remotely, so the scaling service could just as easily be a console application or Windows service running on some local server as it could be a stateless service in the Service Fabric application. 

## Credential management
One challenge of writing a service to handle scaling is that the service must be able to access VM Scale Set resources without an interactive login. Accessing the Service Fabric cluster is easy if the scaling service is modifying its own Service Fabric application, but credentials are needed to access the VM Scale Set which is a separate Azure entity from the Service Fabric cluster. To login, you can use a [service principal](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/blob/Fluent/AUTH.md#creating-a-service-principal-in-azure) created with the [Azure CLI 2.0](https://github.com/azure/azure-cli).

A service principal can be created with the following steps:

1. Log in to the Azure CLI (`az login`) as a user with access to the Scale Set
2. Create the service principal with `az ad sp create-for-rbac`
	1. Make note of the appId (called 'client ID' elsewhere), name, password, and tenant for later use.
	2. You will also need your subscription ID, which can be viewed with `az account list`

The fluent compute library can log in using these credentials as follows:

```C#
var credentials = AzureCredentials.FromServicePrincipal(AzureClientId, AzureClientKey, AzureTenantId, AzureEnvironment.AzureGlobalCloud);
IAzure AzureClient = Azure.Authenticate(credentials).WithSubscription(AzureSubscriptionId);

if (AzureClient?.SubscriptionId == AzureSubscriptionId)
{
    ServiceEventSource.Current.ServiceMessage(Context, "Successfully logged into Azure");
}
else
{
    ServiceEventSource.Current.ServiceMessage(Context, "ERROR: Failed to login to Azure");
}
```

Once logged in, VMSS instance count can be queried via `AzureClient.VirtualMachineScaleSets.GetById(ScaleSetId).Capacity`.

## Scaling out
Using the fluent Azure compute SDK, instances can be added to the VM Scale Set with just a few calls -

```C#
var scaleSet = AzureClient?.VirtualMachineScaleSets.GetById(ScaleSetId);
var newCapacity = Math.Min(MaximumNodeCount, NodeCount.Value + 1);
scaleSet.Update().WithCapacity(newCapacity).Apply(); 
``` 

**Note that there is currently [a bug](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/issues/2716) which keeps this from working**, but a fix has been merged, so the issue should be resolved in published versions of Microsoft.Azure.Management.Compute.Fluent soon. The bug is that when changing VMSS properties (like capacity) with the fluent compute API, protected settings from the VMSS's ARM template are lost. This causes (among other things) Service Fabric services to not setup properly on new nodes.

As a temporary workaround, PowerShell cmdlets can be invoked from the scaling service to enact the same change (though this route means that PowerShell tools must be present):

```C#
using (var psInstance = PowerShell.Create())
{
    psInstance.AddScript($@"
        $clientId = ""{AzureClientId}""
        $clientKey = ConvertTo-SecureString -String ""{AzureClientKey}"" -AsPlainText -Force
        $Credential = New-Object -TypeName ""System.Management.Automation.PSCredential"" -ArgumentList $clientId, $clientKey
        Login-AzureRmAccount -Credential $Credential -ServicePrincipal -TenantId {AzureTenantId}
        
        $vmss = Get-AzureRmVmss -ResourceGroupName {ResourceGroup} -VMScaleSetName {NodeTypeToScale}
        $vmss.sku.capacity = {newCapacity}
        Update-AzureRmVmss -ResourceGroupName {ResourceGroup} -Name {NodeTypeToScale} -VirtualMachineScaleSet $vmss
    ");

    psInstance.Invoke();

    if (psInstance.HadErrors)
    {
        foreach (var error in psInstance.Streams.Error)
        {
            ServiceEventSource.Current.ServiceMessage(Context, $"ERROR adding node: {error.ToString()}");
        }
    }                
}
```

As before, adding a VMSS instance should be all that's needed to start a new Service Fabric node since the VMSS template includes Service Fabric extensions to automatically add all VMs to the Service Fabric cluster. 

## Scaling in

Scaling in is similar to scaling out. The actual VMSS changes are practically the same as for scaling out, but in the scale-in case it's also necessary to interact with the Service Fabric cluster to shutdown the node to be removed and then to remove its state.

Preparing the node for shutdown involves finding the node to be removed (the most recently added node) and deactivating it. For non-seed nodes, newer nodes can be found by comparing `NodeInstanceId`. 

```C#
using (var client = new FabricClient())
{
	var mostRecentLiveNode = (await client.QueryManager.GetNodeListAsync())
	    .Where(n => n.NodeType.Equals(NodeTypeToScale, StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase))
	    .Where(n => n.NodeStatus == System.Fabric.Query.NodeStatus.Up)
	    .OrderByDescending(n => n.NodeInstanceId)
	    .FirstOrDefault();
```

Be aware that *seed* nodes don't seem to always follow the convention that greater instance IDs will be removed first.

Once the node to be removed is found, it can be deactivated and removed using the same `FabricClient` instance and the `IAzure` instance from earlier.

```C#
var scaleSet = AzureClient?.VirtualMachineScaleSets.GetById(ScaleSetId);

// Remove the node from the Service Fabric cluster
ServiceEventSource.Current.ServiceMessage(Context, $"Disabling node {mostRecentLiveNode.NodeName}");
await client.ClusterManager.DeactivateNodeAsync(mostRecentLiveNode.NodeName, NodeDeactivationIntent.RemoveNode);

// Wait (up to a timeout) for the node to gracefully shutdown
var timeout = TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5);
var waitStart = DateTime.Now;
while ((mostRecentLiveNode.NodeStatus == System.Fabric.Query.NodeStatus.Up || mostRecentLiveNode.NodeStatus == System.Fabric.Query.NodeStatus.Disabling) &&
        DateTime.Now - waitStart < timeout)
{
    mostRecentLiveNode = (await client.QueryManager.GetNodeListAsync()).FirstOrDefault(n => n.NodeName == mostRecentLiveNode.NodeName);
    await Task.Delay(10 * 1000);
}

// Decrement VMSS capacity
var newCapacity = Math.Max(MinimumNodeCount, NodeCount.Value - 1); // Check min count 

scaleSet.Update().WithCapacity(newCapacity).Apply(); 
```

Once the VM instance is removed, Service Fabric node state can be removed.

```C#
await client.ClusterManager.RemoveNodeStateAsync(mostRecentLiveNode.NodeName);
```

As before, you will need to work-around `IVirtualMachineScaleSet.Update()` not working until [Azure/azure-sdk-for-net#2716](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/issues/2716) is addressed.

## Potential drawbacks

As demonstrated in the code sample above, creating your own scaling service provides the highest degree of control and customizability over your application's scaling behavior, but comes with a tradeoff of code complexity. Using this approach means that you will need to own scaling code which is non-trivial.

For scenarios which require precise control over when and how an application scales in or out, this approach can be a very useful one.

How you approach Service Fabric scaling will depend on your scenario. If scaling is uncommon, the ability to add or remove nodes manually is probably sufficient. For more complex scenarios, auto-scale rules and SDKs exposing the ability to scale programmatically offer powerful alternatives.

## Next steps

To get start implementing your own auto-scaling logic, familiarize yourself with the following concepts and useful APIs:

- [Scaling manually or with auto-scale rules](/service-fabric-cluster-scale-up-down.md)
- [Fluent Azure Management Libraries for .NET](https://github.com/Azure/azure-sdk-for-net/tree/Fluent) (useful for interacting with a Service Fabric cluster's underlying virtual machine scale sets)
- [System.Fabric.FabricClient](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.fabric.fabricclient) (useful for interacting with a Service Fabric cluster and it's nodes)
