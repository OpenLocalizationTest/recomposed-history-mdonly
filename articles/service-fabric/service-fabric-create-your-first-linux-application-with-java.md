# Create your first Azure Service Fabric application on Linux with Java

Service Fabric provides SDKs for building services on Linux in both .NET Core and Java. In this tutorial, we will look at how to create an application for Linux and build a service using Java.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure that you have [set up your Linux development environment](service-fabric-get-started-linux.md). If you are using Mac OS X, you can [set up a Linux one-box environment in a virtual machine using Vagrant](service-fabric-get-started-mac.md).

## Create the application

A Service Fabric application can contain one or more services, each with a specific role in delivering the application's functionality. The Service Fabric SDK for Linux includes a [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) generator that makes it easy to create your first service and to add more later. Let's look at how to use Yeoman to create a new application with a single service.

1. In a terminal, type **yo azuresf**.
