Once an [application type has been packaged][10], it's ready for deployment into an Azure Service Fabric cluster. Deployment involves the following three steps:

1. Upload the application package to the image store
2. Register the application type
3. Create the application instance

After an app is deployed and running in the cluster, you can also remove the app. App removal involves the following steps:

1. Remove (or delete) the running application
2. Unregister the application type if you no longer need it
3. Remove the application package from the image store

If you use [Visual Studio for deploying and debugging applications](service-fabric-publish-app-remote-cluster.md) on your local development cluster, all the preceding steps are handled automatically through a PowerShell script.  This script is found in the *Scripts* folder of the application project. This article provides background on what those scripts are doing so that you can perform the same operations outside of Visual Studio. 
 
## Connect to the cluster
Before you run any PowerShell commands in this article, always start by using [Connect-ServiceFabricCluster](/powershell/servicefabric/vlatest/connect-servicefabriccluster) to connect to the Service Fabric cluster. To connect to the local development cluster, run the following:

```powershell
Connect-ServiceFabricCluster
```

For examples of connecting to a remote cluster or cluster secured using Azure Active Directory, X509 certificates, or Windows Active Directory see [Connect to a secure cluster](service-fabric-connect-to-secure-cluster.md).

## Upload the application package
Uploading the application package puts it in a location that's accessible by internal Service Fabric components.  The [Copy-ServiceFabricApplicationPackage](/powershell/servicefabric/vlatest/copy-servicefabricapplicationpackage) command uploads the application package to the cluster image store. The **Get-ImageStoreConnectionStringFromClusterManifest** cmdlet, which is part of the Service Fabric SDK PowerShell module, is used to get the image store connection string.  To import the SDK module, run:

```powershell
Import-Module "$ENV:ProgramFiles\Microsoft SDKs\Service Fabric\Tools\PSModule\ServiceFabricSDK\ServiceFabricSDK.psm1"
```

Suppose you build and package an app named *MyApplication* in Visual Studio. By default, the application type name listed in the ApplicationManifest.xml is "MyApplicationType".  The application package, which contains the necessary application manifest, service manifests, and code/config/data packages, is located in *C:\Users\username\Documents\Visual Studio 2015\Projects\MyApplication\MyApplication\pkg\Debug*. 

The following command lists the contents of the application package:

```powershell
PS C:\temp> tree /f 'C:\Users\user\Documents\Visual Studio 2015\Projects\MyApplication\MyApplication\pkg\Debug'
Folder PATH listing for volume OSDisk
Volume serial number is 0459-2393
C:\USERS\USER\DOCUMENTS\VISUAL STUDIO 2015\PROJECTS\MYAPPLICATION\MYAPPLICATION\PKG\DEBUG
³   ApplicationManifest.xml
³   
----Stateless1Pkg
    ³   ServiceManifest.xml
    ³   
    ----Code
    ³       Microsoft.ServiceFabric.Data.dll
    ³       Microsoft.ServiceFabric.Data.Interfaces.dll
    ³       Microsoft.ServiceFabric.Internal.dll
    ³       Microsoft.ServiceFabric.Internal.Strings.dll
    ³       Microsoft.ServiceFabric.Services.dll
    ³       ServiceFabricServiceModel.dll
    ³       Stateless1.exe
    ³       Stateless1.exe.config
    ³       Stateless1.pdb
    ³       System.Fabric.dll
    ³       System.Fabric.Strings.dll
    ³       
    ----Config
            Settings.xml
```

The following example uploads the package to the image store, into a folder named "MyApplicationV1":

```powershell
PS C:\> $path = 'C:\Users\user\Documents\Visual Studio 2015\Projects\MyApplication\MyApplication\pkg\Debug'
Copy-ServiceFabricApplicationPackage -ApplicationPackagePath $path -ApplicationPackagePathInImageStore MyApplicationV1 -ImageStoreConnectionString (Get-ImageStoreConnectionStringFromClusterManifest(Get-ServiceFabricClusterManifest))
```

If you do not specify the *-ApplicationPackagePathInImageStore* parameter, the app package is copied into the "Debug" folder in the image store.

See [Understand the image store connection string](service-fabric-image-store-connection-string.md) for supplementary information about the image store and image store connection string.

## Register the application package
The application type and version declared in the application manifest becomes available for use when the app package is registered. The system reads the package uploaded in the previous step, verifies the package, processes the package contents, and copies the processed package to an internal system location.  If you want to verify the app package locally, use the [Test-ServiceFabricApplicationPackage](/powershell/servicefabric/vlatest/servicefabric/test-servicefabricapplicationpackage) cmdlet.

Run the [Register-ServiceFabricApplicationType](/powershell/servicefabric/vlatest/register-servicefabricapplicationtype) cmdlet to register the application type in the cluster and make it available for deployment:

```powershell
PS D:\temp> Register-ServiceFabricApplicationType MyApplicationV1
Register application type succeeded
```

"MyApplicationV1" is the folder in the image store where the app package is located. The application type with name "MyApplicationType" and version "1.0.0" (both are found in the application manifest) is now registered in the cluster.

The [Register-ServiceFabricApplicationType](/powershell/servicefabric/vlatest/register-servicefabricapplicationtype) command returns only after the system has successfully registered the application package. How long registration takes depends on the size and contents of the application package. If needed, the **-TimeoutSec** parameter can be used to supply a longer timeout (the default timeout is 60 seconds).  If it is a large app package and you are experiencing timeouts, use the **-Async** parameter.

The [Get-ServiceFabricApplicationType](/powershell/servicefabric/vlatest/get-servicefabricapplicationtype) command lists all successfully registered application type versions.

```powershell
PS D:\temp> Get-ServiceFabricApplicationType

ApplicationTypeName    : MyApplicationType
ApplicationTypeVersion : 1.0.0
Status                 : Available
DefaultParameters      : { "Stateless1_InstanceCount" = "-1" }
```

## Create the application
You can instantiate an application from any application type version that has been registered successfully by using the [New-ServiceFabricApplication](/powershell/servicefabric/vlatest/new-servicefabricapplication) cmdlet. The name of each application must start with the *fabric:* scheme and be unique for each application instance. Any default services defined in the application manifest of the target application type are also created.

```powershell
PS D:\temp> New-ServiceFabricApplication fabric:/MyApp MyApplicationType 1.0.0

ApplicationName        : fabric:/MyApp
ApplicationTypeName    : MyApplicationType
ApplicationTypeVersion : 1.0.0
ApplicationParameters  : {}
```
Multiple application instances can be created for any given version of a registered application type. Each application instance runs in isolation, with its own work directory and process.

To see which named apps and services are running in the cluster, run the [Get-ServiceFabricApplication](/powershell/servicefabric/vlatest/get-servicefabricapplication) and [Get-ServiceFabricService](/powershell/servicefabric/vlatest/get-servicefabricservice) cmdlets:

```powershell
PS D:\temp> Get-ServiceFabricApplication  

ApplicationName        : fabric:/MyApp
ApplicationTypeName    : MyApplicationType
ApplicationTypeVersion : 1.0.0
ApplicationStatus      : Ready
HealthState            : Ok
ApplicationParameters  : {}

PS D:\temp> Get-ServiceFabricApplication | Get-ServiceFabricService

ServiceName            : fabric:/MyApp/Stateless1
ServiceKind            : Stateless
ServiceTypeName        : Stateless1Type
IsServiceGroup         : False
ServiceManifestVersion : 1.0.0
ServiceStatus          : Active
HealthState            : Ok
```

## Remove an application
When an application instance is no longer needed, you can permanently remove it by name using the [Remove-ServiceFabricApplication](/powershell/servicefabric/vlatest/remove-servicefabricapplication) cmdlet. [Remove-ServiceFabricApplication](/powershell/servicefabric/vlatest/remove-servicefabricapplication) automatically removes all services that belong to the application as well, permanently removing all service state. This operation cannot be reversed, and application state cannot be recovered.

```powershell
PS D:\temp> Remove-ServiceFabricApplication fabric:/MyApp

Confirm
Continue with this operation?
[Y] Yes  [N] No  [S] Suspend  [?] Help (default is "Y"):
Remove application instance succeeded

PS D:\temp> Get-ServiceFabricApplication
PS D:\temp>
```

## Unregister an application type
When a particular version of an application type is no longer needed, you should unregister it's application type by using the [Unregister-ServiceFabricApplicationType](/powershell/servicefabric/vlatest/unregister-servicefabricapplicationtype) cmdlet. Unregistering unused types releases storage space used by the image store. An application type can be unregistered as long as no applications are instantiated against it and no pending application upgrades are referencing it.

Run [Get-ServiceFabricApplicationType](/powershell/servicefabric/vlatest/get-servicefabricapplicationtype) to see the application types currently registered in the cluster:

```powershell
PS D:\temp> Get-ServiceFabricApplicationType

ApplicationTypeName    : MyApplicationType
ApplicationTypeVersion : 1.0.0
Status                 : Available
DefaultParameters      : { "Stateless1_InstanceCount" = "-1" }
```

Run [Unregister-ServiceFabricApplicationType](/powershell/servicefabric/vlatest/unregister-servicefabricapplicationtype) to unregister a specific application type:

```powershell
PS D:\temp> Unregister-ServiceFabricApplicationType MyApplicationType 1.0.0
```
## Remove an application package from the image store
When an application package is no longer needed, you can delete it from the image store to free up system resources.

```powershell
Remove-ServiceFabricApplicationPackage -ApplicationPackagePathInImageStore MyApplicationV1 -ImageStoreConnectionString (Get-ImageStoreConnectionStringFromClusterManifest(Get-ServiceFabricClusterManifest))
```

## Troubleshooting
### Copy-ServiceFabricApplicationPackage asks for an ImageStoreConnectionString
The Service Fabric SDK environment should already have the correct defaults set up. But if needed, the ImageStoreConnectionString for all commands should match the value that the Service Fabric cluster is using. You can find the ImageStoreConnectionString in the cluster manifest, retrieved using the [Get-ServiceFabricClusterManifest](/powershell/servicefabric/vlatest/get-servicefabricclustermanifest) command:

```powershell
PS D:\temp> Get-ServiceFabricClusterManifest
```

The ImageStoreConnectionString is found in the cluster manifest:

```xml
<ClusterManifest xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" Name="Server-Default-SingleNode" Version="1.0" xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/2011/01/fabric">

    [...]

    <Section Name="Management">
      <Parameter Name="ImageStoreConnectionString" Value="file:D:\ServiceFabric\Data\ImageStore" />
    </Section>

    [...]
```
