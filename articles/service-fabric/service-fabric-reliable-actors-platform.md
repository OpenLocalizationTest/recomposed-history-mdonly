# How Reliable Actors use the Service Fabric platform

This article explains how Reliable Actors work on the Service Fabric platform. Reliable Actors run in a framework that is hosted in an implementation of a stateful Reliable Service called the *Actor Service*. The Actor Service contains all the components necessary to manage the lifecycle and message dispatching for your actors:

 - The Actor Runtime manages lifecycle, garbage collection, and enforces single-threaded access.
 - An actor service remoting listener accepts remote access calls to actors and sends them to a dispatcher to route to the appropriate actor instance.
 - The Actor State Provider wraps state providers (such as the Reliable Collections state provider) and provides an adapter for actor state management.

These components together form the Reliable Actor framework. 

## Service Layering

Because the Actor Service itself is a Reliable Service, all of the [application model](service-fabric-application-model.md), lifecycle, [packaging](service-fabric-application-model.md#package-an-application), [deployment]((service-fabric-deploy-remove-applications.md#deploy-an-application), upgrade, and scaling concepts of Reliable Services apply the same way to Actor services. 

![Actor Service layering][1]

The diagram above shows the relationship between the Service Fabric application frameworks and user code. Blue elements represent the Reliable Services application framework, orange represents the Reliable Actor framework, and green represents user code. 


In Reliable Services, your service inherits the `StatefulService` class, which itself is derived from `StatefulServiceBase`. (or `StatelessService` for stateless services). In Reliable Actors, you use the Actor Service which is a different implementation of the `StatefulServiceBase` class that implements the actor pattern where your actors execute. Since the Actor Service itself is just an implementation of `StatefulServiceBase`, you can write your own service that derives from `ActorService` and implement service-level features the same way you would when inheriting `StatefulService`, such as:

 - Service back-up and restore.
 - Shared functionality for all Actors, for example, a circuit-breaker.
 - Remoting procedure calls on the actor service itself, as well as on each individual actor. 

### Using the Actor Service

Like all Reliable Services, the Actor Service must be registered with a service type in the Service Fabric runtime. In order for the Actor Service to run your actor instances, your actor type must also be registered with the Actor Service. The `ActorRuntime` registration method performs this work for actors. In the simplest case, you can just register your actor type, and the Actor Service with default settings will implicitly be used:

```C#
static class Program
{
    private static void Main()
    {
        ActorRuntime.RegisterActorAsync<MyActor>().GetAwaiter().GetResult();

        Thread.Sleep(Timeout.Infinite);
    }
}
```  

Alternatively, you can use a lambda provided by the registration method to construct the Actor Service yourself. This allows you to configure the Actor Service as well as explicitly construct your actor instances, where you can inject dependencies to your actor through its constructor:

```C#
static class Program
{
    private static void Main()
    {
        ActorRuntime.RegisterActorAsync<MyActor>(
            (context, actorType) => new ActorService(context, actorType, () => new MyActor()))
            .GetAwaiter().GetResult();

        Thread.Sleep(Timeout.Infinite);
    }
}
```

Using this lambda, you can also register your own actor service that derives from `ActorService` where you can implement service-level functionality. This is done by writing a service class that inherits `ActorService`:

```C#
class MyActorService : ActorService
    {
    public MyActorService(StatefulServiceContext context, ActorTypeInformation typeInfo, Func<ActorBase> newActor)
        : base(context, typeInfo, newActor)
    { }
      }
```

```C#
static class Program
{
    private static void Main()
    {
        ActorRuntime.RegisterActorAsync<MyActor>(
            (context, actorType) => new MyActorService(context, actorType, () => new MyActor()))
            .GetAwaiter().GetResult();

        Thread.Sleep(Timeout.Infinite);
    }
}
```

This custom actor service inherits all of the actor runtime functionality from `ActorService` and can be used to implement your own service methods. In the following example, the custom actor service exposes a method to remotely back-up actor data by taking advantage of the remoting listener already present in `ActorService`:

```C#
public interface IMyActorService : IService
    {
    Task BackupActorsAsync();
}

class MyActorService : ActorService, IMyActorService
{
    public MyActorService(StatefulServiceContext context, ActorTypeInformation typeInfo, Func<ActorBase> newActor)
        : base(context, typeInfo, newActor)
    { }

    public Task BackupActorsAsync()
    {
        return this.BackupAsync(new BackupDescription(...));
      }
    }
```

In this example, `IMyActorService` is a remoting contract that is implemented by `MyActorService`, which makes all methods on `IMyActorService` available to a client using the `ActorServiceProxy`:

```C#
IMyActorService myActorServiceProxy = ActorServiceProxy.Create<IMyActorService>(
    new Uri("fabric:/MyApp/MyService"), ActorId.CreateRandom());

await myActorServiceProxy.BackupActorsAsync();
```

#### Accessing service functions from actor instances

Actor instances have access to the Actor Service in which they are executing. Through the Actor Service, actor instances can programmatically obtain the Service Context which has the partition ID, service name, application name, and other Service Fabric platform-specific information:

```csharp
Task MyActorMethod()
{
    Guid partitionId = this.ActorService.Context.PartitionId;
    string serviceTypeName = this.ActorService.Context.ServiceTypeName;
    Uri serviceInstanceName = this.ActorService.Context.ServiceName;
    string applicationInstanceName = this.ActorService.Context.CodePackageActivationContext.ApplicationName;
}
```

### Comparison to a stateful Reliable Service

This is very similar to a stateful Reliable Service with only a few minor differences.
Registration uses the `ServiceRuntime` instead of `ActorRuntime`:
```C#
internal static class Program
{
    private static void Main()
    {
        
        ServiceRuntime.RegisterServiceAsync("MyServiceType",
            context => new MyService(context)).GetAwaiter().GetResult();

        Thread.Sleep(Timeout.Infinite);
    }
}
```
The service class implements `StatefulService` instead of `ActorService`. In this example, the service implementation creates a remoting listener for RPC calls. `StatefulService` itself does not set up any communication listeners.

```C#
public interface IMyService : IService
{
    Task BackupAsync();
}

public class MyService : StatefulService, IMyService
{
    public MyService(StatefulServiceContext context)
        : base(context)
    {
    }

    public Task BackupAsync()
    {
        return this.BackupAsync(new BackupDescription(...));
    }

    protected override IEnumerable<ServiceReplicaListener> CreateServiceReplicaListeners()
    {
        return new[]
    {
            new ServiceReplicaListener(context =>
                this.CreateServiceRemotingListener(context))
        };
      }
    }
```
When using remoting, `ServiceProxy` is used to make RPC calls instead of `ActorServiceProxy`. The difference is minor, and in fact `ActorServiceProxy` simply uses `ServiceProxy` internally with custom settings tuned to work better with Actor Services.

```C#
IMyService myServiceProxy = ServiceProxy.Create<IMyService>(
    new Uri("fabric:/MyApp/MyService"));

await myServiceProxy.BackupAsync();
```

## Application model

Actor services are Reliable Services, so the application model is the same. However, the actor framework build tools generate much of the application model files for you.

### Service Manifest
 
The contents of your actor service's ServiceManifest.xml are generated automatically by the actor framework build tools. This includes:

 - The actor service type. The type name is generated based on your actor project name. Based on the persistence attribute on your actor, the HasPersistedState flag is also set accordingly.
 - Code package.
 - Config package.
 - Resources and endpoints

### Application Manifest

The actor framework build tools automatically create a default service definition for your actor service. The default service properties are populated by the build tools:

 - Replica set count is determined by the persistence attribute on your actor. Each time the persistence attribute on your actor is changed, the replica set count in the default service definition will be reset accordingly.
 - Partition scheme and range is set to Uniform Int64 with the full Int64 key range.

## Service Fabric partition concepts for actors

Actor services are partitioned stateful services. Each partition of an actor service contains a set of actors. Service partitions are automatically distributed over multiple nodes in Service Fabric. Thus, actor instances are distributed as a result.

![Actor partitioning and distribution][5]

Reliable Services can be created with different partition schemes and partition key ranges. The Actor Service uses the Int64 partitioning scheme with the full Int64 key range to map actors to partitions. 

### Actor ID

Each actor that's created in the service has a unique ID associated with it, represented by the `ActorId` class. The `ActorId` is an opaque id value that can be used for uniform distribution of actors across the service partitions by generating random IDs:

```C#
ActorProxy.Create<IMyActor>(ActorId.CreateRandom());
```

Every `ActorId` is hashed to an Int64, which is why the actor service must use an Int64 partitioning scheme with the full Int64 key range. However, custom ID values can be used for an `ActorID`, including GUIDs, strings, and Int64s. 

```C#
ActorProxy.Create<IMyActor>(new ActorId(Guid.NewGuid()));
ActorProxy.Create<IMyActor>(new ActorId("myActorId"));
ActorProxy.Create<IMyActor>(new ActorId(1234));
```

When using GUIDs and strings, the values are hashed to an Int64. However, when explicitly providing an Int64 to an `ActorId`, the Int64 will map directly to a partition without further hashing. This can be used to control which partition actors are placed in.
