# Service Fabric on Linux

The preview will be made publicly available on September 26 as announced [in this blog post](https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/service-fabric-on-linux-support-available-this-month/). The preview of Service Fabric on Linux enables you you to build, deploy, and manage highly available, highly scalable applications on Linux just as you would on Windows. In addition, the high-level Service Fabric frameworks (Reliable Services and Reliable Actors) are now available in Java.

> [AZURE.VIDEO service-fabric-linux-preview]

## Supported operating systems and programming languages

The limited preview supports the creation of one-box development clusters as well as multi-machine clusters in Azure running Ubuntu Server 16.04.

You can build [guest executable services](service-fabric-deploy-existing-app.md) with any language or framework. You can also use Java or C# to build services based on the Reliable Services and Reliable Actor frameworks, as well as orchestrate Docker containers.

>[AZURE.NOTE] Reliable Collections are not supported in Linux yet.

## Participate in the preview


Please note that Service Fabric on Linux will be conceptually equivalent to what is available on Windows (except for OS specifics and programming language support), so most of our [existing documentation](http://aka.ms/servicefabricdocs) applies and will help you get familiar with the technology.

## Next steps

Get familiar with the [Reliable Actors](service-fabric-reliable-actors-introduction.md) and [Reliable Services](service-fabric-reliable-services-introduction.md) programming frameworks.
