# Test a Service Fabric service
Testability employs a suite of tools specifically designed for testing the services you have built on Azure Service Fabric. By using the tools, you can easily induce meaningful faults and run test scenarios. These tests exercise and validate the numerous different states and transitions your services experience throughout their lifetimes, all in a controlled and safe manner. To learn more, read:

- [Run an action](service-fabric-testability-actions.md)  
- [Run a scenario](service-fabric-testability-scenarios.md)
