# Create your first Service Fabric container app
You can create a Service Fabric standalone cluster on any virtual machines or computers running Windows Server 2012 R2 or Windows Server 2016, on-premises or in the cloud. This quickstart helps you to create a development standalone cluster in just a few minutes.  When you're finished, you have a three-node cluster running on a single computer that you can deploy apps to.

## Before you begin
The development computer must be running:
* Visual Studio 2015 or Visual Studio 2017.
* [Service Fabric SDK and tools](service-fabric-get-started.md).
* Docker for Windows.  [Get Docker CE for Windows (stable)](https://store.docker.com/editions/community/docker-ce-desktop-windows?tab=description).

You need a Windows cluster with 3 or more nodes running on Windows Server 2016 with Containers. Not a development cluster.
