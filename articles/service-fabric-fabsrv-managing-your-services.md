# Managing your Service Fabric applications

You can manage your Microsoft Azure Service Fabric applications and services through Visual Studio. Once you've [setup your development environment](../service-fabric-setup-your-development-environment), you can use the Service Fabric extensions to add services, or package, register, and deploy applications in your local development cluster. You can also use the underlying Powershell scripts to write your own scripts, or just to see what's happening under the covers.

To manage your Service Fabric application, in the Solution Explorer right click on your application project and expand the **Service Fabric** menu.
