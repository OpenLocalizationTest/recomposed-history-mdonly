#Using the Azure Cross-Platform Command-Line Interface with the Resource Management Service

In the Spring 2014 update, we introduced a new way to manage Microsoft Azure. This new management functionality is called the Resource Management Service. In this article, you will learn how to use the Azure Cross-Platform Command-Line Interface (xplat-cli) to work with the Resource Management Service. 

>[WACOM.NOTE] If you have not already installed and configured xplat-cli, see [Install and Configure the Microsoft Azure Cross-Platform Command-Line Interface][xplatsetup] for more steps on how to install, configure, and use the xplat-cli.

##Resource Management Service

Historically, managing a _resource_ (a user-managed entity such as a database server, database or web site,) in Microsoft Azure required you to perform operations against one resource at a time. If you had a complex application made up of multiple resources, your automation scripts often grew in complexity as you added commands to work with new resources. This is **Azure Service Management**, and is the default mode of the xplat-cli.

The **Resource Management Service** is a new way of managing resources. It allows you to manage multiple resources as a logical group, known as a _resource group_. Typically a group will contain resources related to a specific application. For example, a group may contain a Web Site resource that hosts your public website, a SQL Database that stores relational data used by the site, and a Storage Account that stores non-relational assets. Operations against a resource group are applied through a _deployment_.

>[WACOM.NOTE] The Resource Management Service is currently in preview, and may not provide the same management capabilities as Azure Service Management.

The Resource Management Service also introduces the concept of *templates*, which allows you to define a resource group and the resources within it in a declarative fashion. The template is used to create a deployment, which applies changes defined in the template to the group.

While a template is simply a JSON document, the template language allows you to describe parameters that can be filled in either inline when running a command, or stored in a separate JSON file. This allows you to easily create new resources using the same template by simply providing different parameters. For example, a template that creates a Web Site will have parameters for the site name, the site mode (Free, Shared, Basic, or Standard,) and other common parameters.

>[WACOM.NOTE] The specifics of the template language are not documented at this time. Once documentation is available, this topic will be updated to provide a link to the reference documentation.
>
> However, you can use the `azure group template download` command to download and modify templates provided by Microsoft and partners from the template gallery.

##Authentication

Currently, working with the Resource Management Service through the xplat-cli requires that you authenticate to Microsoft Azure using an organizational ID. Authenticating with a Microsoft Account or a certificate installed through a .publishsettings file will not work.

An organizational ID is a user that is managed by your organization, and defined in your organizations Azure Active Directory tenant. If you do not currently have an organizational ID, and are using a Microsoft account to log in to your Azure subscription, you can easily create an one using the following steps.

1. Login to the [Azure Management Portal][portal], and click on **Active Directory**.

2. If no directory exists, select **Create your directory** and provide the requested information.

3. Select your directory and add a new user. This new user is an organizational ID.

	>[WACOM.NOTE] During the creation of the user, you will be supplied with both an e-mail address for the user and a temporary password. Save this  information as it is used in another step.

4. From the management portal, select **Settings** and then select **Administrators**. Select **Add**, and add the new user as a co-administrator. This allows the organizational ID to manage your Azure subscription.

5. Finally, log out of the Azure portal and then log back in using the new organizational ID. If this is the first time logging in with this ID, you will be prompted to change the password.

For more information on organizational accounts with Microsoft Azure, see [Sign up for Microsoft Azure as an Organization][signuporg].

##Working with Groups and Templates

1. The Resource Management Service is currently in preview, so the xplat-cli commands to work with it are not enabled by default. Use the following command to enable the commands.

		azure config mode arm

	>[WACOM.NOTE] The Resource Management Service mode and Azure Service Management mode are mutually exclusive. That is, resources created in one mode cannot be managed from the other mode.

2. When working with templates, you can either create your own, or use one from the Template Gallery. To list available templates from the gallery, use the following command.

		azure group template list

3. To view details of a template that will create an Azure Web Site, use the following command.

		azure group template show Microsoft.WebSite.0.1.0-preview1

4. Once you have selected a template, you can download it with the following command.

		azure group template download Microsoft.WebSite.0.1.0-preview1

	Downloading a template allows you to customize it to better suite your requirements. For example, adding another resource to the template.

	>[WACOM.NOTE] If you do modify the template, use the `azure group template validate` command to validate the template before using it to create or modify an existing resource group.

5. Open the template file in a text editor. Note the **parameters** collection near the top. This contains a list of the parameters that this template expects in order to create the resources described by the template. When using a template, you must supply these parameters either as part of the command-line parameters, or by specifying a file containing the parameter values. Either way, the parameters must be in JSON format.

	To create a file that contains parameters for the Microsoft.WebSite.0.1.0-preview1 template, use the following data and create a file named **params.json**. Replace values beginning with **My** such as **MyWebSite** with your own values. The **siteLocation** should specify an Azure region near you, such as **North Europe** or **South Central US**.

		{
		    "properties": {
		        "parameters": {
		            "siteName": {
		                "value": "MyWebSiteName"
		            },
		            "hostingPlanName": {
		                "value": "MyWebSitePlanName"
		            },
		            "siteLocation": {
		                "value": "MyRegion"
		            },
		            "sku": {
		                "value": "Free"
		            },
		            "workerSize": {
		                "value": "0"
		            }
		        }
		    }
		}

1. After saving the **params.json** file, use the following command to create a new resource group based on the template. The `-e` parameter specifies the **params.json** file created in the previous step.

		azure group create MyGroupName "MyDataCenter" -y Microsoft.WebSite.0.1.0-preview1 -d MyDeployment -e params.json

	Replace the **MyGroupName** with the group name you wish to use, and **MyDataCenter** with the **siteLocation** value specified in the template.

	>[WACOM.NOTE] This command will return OK once the deployment has been uploaded, but before the deployment have been applied to resources in the group. To check the status of the deployment, use the following command.
	>
	> `azure group deployment show MyGroupName MyDeployment`
	> 
	> The **ProvisioningState** shows the status of the deployment.
	> 
	> If you realize that your configuration isn't correct, and need to stop a long running deployment, use the following command.
	> 
	> `azure group deployment stop MyGroupName MyDeployment`
	> 
	> If you do not provide a deployment name, one will be created automatically based on the current date and time. It will be returned as part of the output of the `azure group create` command.

3. To view the group, use the following command.

		azure group show MyGroupName

	This command returns information about the resources in the group. If you have multiple groups, you can use the `azure group list` command to retrieve a list of group names, and then use `azure group show` to view details of a specific group.

4. To view individual resources, such as the Web Site, within the group, use the following command.

		azure resource show MyGroupName MyWebSiteName Microsoft.Web/sites -o "2014-04-01"

	Notice the **Microsoft.Web/sites** parameter. This indicates the type of the resource you are requesting information on. If you look at the template file downloaded earlier, you will notice that this same value is used to define the type of the Web Site resource described in the template.

	The `-o` parameter is used to indicate the API version to use when querying this resource. If you are unsure about the API version to use, consult the template file and find the **apiVersion** field for the resource.

	This command returns information related to the web site. For example, the **hostNames** field should contain the URL for the web site. Use this with your browser to verify that the web site is running.

##Working with resources

While templates allow you to declare group-wide changes in configuration, it is not suitable for all tasks. In the previous steps, the `azure resource show` command was used to display details for a specific resource. The following steps demonstrate how to directly modify a resource using the `azure resource set` command.

1. When viewing details on a resource, it is often useful to use the `--json` parameter to see the data structure returned from the server, as this is usually the same format it expects when we attempt to modify a value. Use the following command to return information on the Web Site resource.

		azure resource show MyGroupName MyWebSite Microsoft.Web/sites --json

	>[WACOM.NOTE] You can save the JSON data to file by using the &gt; character to pipe the output to file. For example:
	>
	> `azure resource show MyGroupName MyWebSite Micrsoft.Web/sites --json > myfile.json`

3. To enable web server logging for the Web Site resource, use the following command.

		azure resource set MyGroupName MyWebSite Microsoft.Web/sites -p "{ \"SiteMode\": \"Free\", \"ComputeMode\": \"Shared\" }"

	The `-p` parameter provides the JSON string for this command. Note that  when providing a JSON value as part of the command, you must escape quotes within the JSON string using the '\' character.

##Logging

To view logged information on operations performed on a group, use the `azure group log show` command. By default, this will list last operation performed on the group. To view all operations, use the optional `--all` parameter. For a the last deployment, use `--last-deployment`. For a specific deployment, use `--deployment` and specify the deployment name. The following example returns a log of all operations performed against the group 'MyGroup'.

	azure group log show mygroup --all
