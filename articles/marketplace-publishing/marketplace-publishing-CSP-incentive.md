# What is a Cloud Service Provider?

We are excited to pre-announce that on March 15, 2016, Microsoft will technically enable Microsoft-approved Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) – the same companies who resell Office 365 and Azure first-party services today - to resell partner applications and services listed on Azure Marketplace such as yours, bringing the power of Microsoft’s reseller channel to help drive your cloud business – at no additional cost to you.

# What is the “Reseller Incentive?”

To encourage Microsoft Azure CSP resellers to market and sell Marketplace offerings, software partners will have the option to provide CSPs a “reseller incentive.”  By default, Microsoft will waive the 20% Marketplace Service Fee we retain today when a customer purchases a partner offer directly from Marketplace and pass it through as a price discount to our CSP resellers, meaning at the end of the day there will be no additional cost to our software partners, whose payouts from direct sales on Marketplace will be the same -- you will continue to receive 80% net revenues from such sales.

While we highly encourage you to take advantage of this opportunity (Microsoft-approved resellers driving your cloud business at no cost to you!), if you are not interested in offering a CSP “reseller incentive”, you can go to the Azure Marketplace publisher portal and opt-out.  Microsoft CSPs will still be able to sell your offers but will not receive an incentive.  In other words, Microsoft will not waive its 20% Marketplace Service Fee and pass it through as a price discount to CSPs, and the CSPs will only be able to sell your offers at full Marketplace list price.
