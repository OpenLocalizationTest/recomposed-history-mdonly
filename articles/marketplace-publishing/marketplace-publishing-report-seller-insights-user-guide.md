# How to use the Microsoft Azure Marketplace Seller Insights Portal
## Onboarding

>[!NOTE]
>Administrators only.

### Overview of roles

![Type of account][5]

Use the Seller Insights Portal administrator to add users, edit users, and delete users.

A Seller Insights Portal user can view all data that is available to your organization.

Administrators and users are required to authenticate by using a valid Microsoft account (LiveID http://signup.live.com), or your company’s account. Ensure that the new account ID is associated with a monitored mailbox.

### Invitation to activate your account

Ideally, before signing in to the Seller Insights Portal, the administrator should identify the accounts of the individuals they want to set up as users. Accounts can be a Microsoft account or a company account.

To activate your service, the administrator should go to the URL that is listed in the invitation email (https://reports.azure.com).

>[!NOTE]
>If the administrator email is listed as a Microsoft account and you've not created a Microsoft account that is associated with the email address from which you received the email, you will need to create the account before you sign in. To create the account, go to https://signup.live.command.

### Sign in to the Seller Insights Portal

1. Sign in to the Seller Insights Portal by clicking the URL in the email sent to you.
2. Enter the administrator email address and password.
3. Click the **Sign In** button.
4. Begin to administer your account. Add users, set permissions, and edit users.
5. Ensure your users have the URL for the Seller Insights Portal.

![Sign in page][6]

## Signing in

Your administrator should advise you through email that your account is created, and share the URL for the Seller Insights Portal with you (https://reports.azure.com).

>[!NOTE]
>The administrator is the owner of the account that publishes solutions to the Azure Marketplace. The owner of this account can provide access to others.  

You can sign in to the Seller Insights Portal by using a personal Microsoft account, or by using a company account. The kind of account depends on what your administrator sets up in your profile. Your administrator should advise you about the account you'll use.

## Resetting a password

***Account and password validation***

1. *Validate that the account you're using is registered and the password doesn't work.* If you enter an account that has been registered in Azure Active Directory, it will automatically prompt you to choose how to sign in with the account. You'll use a work or school (Organizational account), or a personal Windows LiveID account.
2. Go to https://reports.azure.com and sign out of any account you may be signed in with, or open it within a private window to ensure no other accounts are signed in.
3. Enter the Publisher email address, but don't enter a password. It will redirect to *Step 4* if it's registered in Azure Active Directory (admin accounts are registered, as are any Organizational accounts that are set up by the admin account).
4. Choose **Work or school account**. Work or school accounts (also called Organizational accounts) are set up by companies that are registered with Azure. Personal accounts (also called LiveID accounts) are personal accounts that are registered with Microsoft.

>[!NOTE]
>It's possible that a user has previously set up a LiveID account by using their company email address. The company later onboarded to Azure, and the same email address was registered as an Organizational account. This means this user can have a LiveID account with the password that they used to create the LiveID, and also have an Organizational account with a separate password that is used by the company.


5. For the Seller Insights Portal, when you select **Work or school account**, ensure you use your Organizational account password combination, and not a LiveID password combination.
6. For an Organizational account, this redirects to the Publisher login page.
7. From here, validate that the password for the Organizational account works or doesn't work. If it doesn't work, continue to the "Password reset" section of this article.

***Password reset***

Try to reset your password by using the Self-Service Password Reset wizard following the links below.

>[!NOTE]
>For Organizational accounts that are set up by the admin account, if the admin turned on the capability to let you reset your own password, you will be able to reset your own password. Otherwise, the password reset form gives you the option to contact your admin.

****Microsoft account (Live ID): https://account.live.com/ResetPassword.aspx****
![Password reset Microsoft account][3]

****Work or school account (Organization ID): https://passwordreset.microsoftonline.com/****
![Password reset work or school account][4]
