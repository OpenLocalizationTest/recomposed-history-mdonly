Your Administrator should advise you via email that your account has been created, and share the URL for the Seller Insights Portal with you (https://reports.azure.com).

You can log in to the Seller Insights Portal using a personal Microsoft account or using a company account depending upon which account your Administrator has used when setting up your profile.  Your Administrator should advise you which account to use.

***Account and Password Validation***

1. ***Validate that the account you're using is registered and the password does not work.*** If you enter an account that has been registered in the Azure Active Directory, it will automatically prompt you to choose how to login with the account - either a Work or School (Organizational account) or a Personal LiveID account.
2. Navigate to https://reports.azure.com and log out of any account you may be logged in with, or open it within a private window to ensure no other accounts are logged in.
3. Enter the Publisher email address without entering a password. It will redirect to ***Step 4*** if it's been registered in Azure Active Directory (Admin accounts are registered, as are any Organizational accounts setup by the Admin account).
4. Choose "Work or school account“. Work or school accounts (‘Organizational accounts’) are setup by companies that have registered with Azure; Personal accounts (‘LiveID’) accounts are personal accounts that have been registered with Microsoft.
 * Note that it is possible that a user previously setup a LiveID account using their company email address, the company later onboarded to Azure, and the same email address was registered as an Organizational account. This means this user can have a LiveID account with the password they used to create the LiveID, and an Organizational account with a separate password used by the company.
5. For the Seller Insights Portal, when selecting "Work or school account“ please ensure you are using your Organizational Account/Password combination and not a LiveID/Password combination.
6. For an Organizational Account, this will re-direct to the Publisher login page.
7. From here, validate that the password for the Organizational account works or does not work. If it does not work, continue to ***Password Reset***.

***Password Reset***

Try to reset your password by using the Self-Service Password Reset wizard following the links below.
 * Note: For Organizational accounts setup by Administrator account, if the Admin turned on the capability to let you to reset your own password, you will be able to reset your own password. Otherwise, the password reset form gives you the option to contact your Admin.
