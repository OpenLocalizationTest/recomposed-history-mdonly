## Pricing Models
Plans can be any combination of BASE + Overage, where BASE is monthly price and Overage is pay-per-use price (see below for more details)

|Pricing Model |Description |
|---------------|------------------------------------------|
|Monthly Only| Flat monthly rate paid at time of purchase e.g. $10/month|
|Overage (aka Usage, Meter) Based | Pay per use, which is defined by the publisher of the offer. Overage cannot be defined per seat, per user, etc as there is no concept of a fraction of a user or capability to do proration. Usage is reported by the Partner on an hourly basis. Customer pays at the of monthly billing cycle as opposed to upfront like monthly plans. |
|Free Trial | Customer may use for free for a limited time and then pay normal rates thereafter |
|Free Tier | Plan is always free |
