# Get Approved via Microsoft Azure Certification Program

This article provides instructions of how to become Microsoft Azure Certified. For a detailed overview of the Microsoft Azure Certification program and its benefits, visit http://azure.com/certified

## Getting started
The first step on the path to getting your application or service certified and onboarded to Azure Marketplace is to fill out the application form on the Microsoft Azure Certified web page.
If you meet the basic eligibility criteria we will ask you to share some more details about your business and the application or service that you want to certify. When we have all the details from you we will review your application to ensure is it’s a good fit for Azure Marketplace and if your application is approved we will start working with you to onboard your solution to Azure Marketplace.
Take these steps to get started:
-	Visit the Microsoft Azure Certified web page: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/partner-program/ to learn more about the program

-	If you are working with a Partner Account Manager or a DX Partner Manager please request them to nominate you for the Azure Certification program. Or go to the Microsoft Azure Certified web page, click on “Request Information” and fill in the application form.

## Next Step
In parallel to the Azure Certification process, you can continue to step 2, [Creating a Microsoft Seller Account](marketplace-publishing-accounts-creation-registration.md).
