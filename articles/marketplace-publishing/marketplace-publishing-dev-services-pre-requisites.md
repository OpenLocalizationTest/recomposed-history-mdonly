## Review the Publisher portal Offer marketing Data

You need to feel certain marketing details about your offering in Markeplace such as description of your product, cpmpany logo's, price plans, details of plans etc. This information is used as marketing content in our azure portal. Please find some of the marketing data mappings [here](marketplace-publishing-dev-services-pre-requisites-marketing-content-guide.md).

## Define Pricing Model for your Offering (section: Pricing & Billing)

Your customers will subscribe to the plans you define. Decide how many options you want to offer and create a Plan for each. Configure trials, availability, migration options, etc.  
Money talks, and the Azure Marketplace gives you the control you need to send the right message! You control the Markets where the Offer is available. You control the price. You even control setting foreign prices automatically or manually defining nice round numbers in each Market.[Example](marketplace-publishing-dev-services-pre-requisites-pricing-model-sample.md)

## Define Offer Profile Metadata

 The Azure Management Portal gives subscribers a plethora of opportunities to learn about your service. Eye catching logos, engaging descriptions, and distinctive plans are only some of the tools that will help you stand out.  Before going to the Publisher Portal, pre-defined your offer metadata and then in the next step input these values.
