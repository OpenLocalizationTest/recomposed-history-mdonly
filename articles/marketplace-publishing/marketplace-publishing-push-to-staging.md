# Preparing your offer for testing in Staging
In this step, you need to provide certain marketing content and details about your offering and/or SKUs in the Azure Marketplace such as description of your product, company logos, price plans, details of plants and other information necessary to push your offer and/or SKU to staging. This information is used as marketing content in our Azure Portal. You will begin this process in the [Publishing Portal][link-pubportal].

## 4.1 Provide Azure Marketplace content
English is the default and only supported language; please ensure that all information provided in the fields is in English. All information can be edited at any time until you push to staging.
1.	Enter the offer summary, long summary, and description for your offer.

  ![drawing][img-map-title]
  *Offer Title & Description*

2.	Upload images of the required specifications (mentioned on Publishing Portal) in PNG format, one for each size.

  ![drawing][img-map-logo]
  *Logos*

3.	All fields must have entries, including the images, in order to be able to push to staging.
4.	In the links tab on the left bar, enter any links with information that may help customers. Enter a name and URL for each link.

5.	In the Legal tab, provide a link to your policies/terms of use. Enter or paste the terms in the large Terms of Use box.

## 4.2 Set your prices
1.	Under the **Pricing** tab, you will see all of the supported markets. Select the appropriate one to bring up the pricing fields.
2.	The provided link on the Publishing Portal will show pricing information to help you in determining the prices of your offer and/or SKU(s).
3.	If your SKU is BYOL, select the checkbox for ‘Externally-licensed (BYOL) SKU availability.
4.	If your SKU is hourly, enter the pricing for your software. SKUs without pricing will not be available for purchase or use.
Note: If you have both BYOL as well as Hourly SKUs, then make sure both the requisites are covered: BYOL checkbox and price values for Hourly.
5.	A pricing wizard will open; proceed through this to complete your pricing, including pricing for other countries, if you choose to allow purchases from outside your specified market.
6.	Some countries are ISV Remit countries. To sell in an ISV Remit country, you must be able to charge and collect tax on your SKUs, and should calculate and pay tax to the government of the country. Microsoft is not in a position to provide legal or tax guidance.  See section ““Sell-to” countries of the Offer” under Introduction of this document for more information on “Sell To Countries”.

### 4.2.1 Pricing Models
Plans can be any combination of BASE + Overage, where BASE is monthly price and Overage is pay-per-use price (see below for more details)

|Pricing Model |Description |
|---------------|------------------------------------------|
|Monthly Only| Flat monthly rate paid at time of purchase e.g. $10/month|
|Overage (aka Usage, Meter) Based | Pay per use, which is defined by the publisher of the offer. Overage cannot be defined per seat, per user, etc as there is no concept of a fraction of a user or capability to do proration. Usage is reported by the Partner on an hourly basis. Customer pays at the of monthly billing cycle as opposed to upfront like monthly plans. |
|Free Trial | Customer may use for free for a limited time and then pay normal rates thereafter |
|Free Tier | Plan is always free |

## 4.5 Test your offer in staging
Staging means deploying your SKU in a private “sandbox” where you can test and validate its functionality before publishing it. The SKU will appear in staging just as it would to a customer who has deployed it. Your SKU must be certified to be pushed to staging. To obtain certification for your SKU, see “3.6. Obtain Certification”.
1.	Click **Push to Staging** in the **Publish** tab.
2.	Correct any errors or discrepancies of which the service may notify you at this point.
3.	Provide the information about the Azure subscription(s) you want to white list and enable to preview your offer. Add the pay-as-you-go subscription you crated earlier.
4.	Your offer will remain in staging until you notify Microsoft that you are ready to push to production. This is an ideal time to have all members of the team check over everything in preparation for your offer going live.
5.	Carry out one round of testing on below points ->

  a.	Marketing content is showing up correctly in gallery

  b.	Validate end-to-end deployment of your offer and customer scenarios e.g. purchase, upgrade, deletion, etc.
