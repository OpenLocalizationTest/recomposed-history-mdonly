# Pre-requisites for creating a multi-Virtual Machine image solution template for the Azure Marketplace

## A. Ensure you are registered as a seller with Microsoft
A company can register only once as seller with Microsoft.
- If you don't know the seller registration stats of your company, please contact us through your Sharepoint site ('Need help?' section) or you can email us at AzureMarketOnboard@microsoft.com
- If you are already registered, find out who in your company owns it? Alternatively, which credentials were used to register? This information can be obtained form your Finance or Marketing Team

If you are not registered, you will need to collect the Company Tax and Payout Information (banking information) and then register your company as a seller in the [Seller Dashboard](https://sellerdashboard.microsoft.com).

> [AZURE.TIP] You do not have to create a seller dashboard account if you are planning to publish only free offers (or worldwide, or bring-your-own-licence).

For instructions on creating and submitting a Microsoft seller profile, visit [Microsoft Seller Account Creation & Registration][link-acct-creation]. And for more details on how to edit approved Seller Profile and filling out Tax and Payout information, refer to Seller Dashboard Help http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn800952.aspx

> [AZURE.TIP] While you company works on the Seller Profile, the developers can start working on creating the Solution Template Topologies in the [Publishing Portal](https:publish.windowsazure.com), getting them certified and testing them in Azure Staging Environment. You will need seller approval only for the final step of publishing your offer to Marketplace.

> [AZURE.TIP] IF you have issues with Seller Registration completion, please log a Support ticket as below:
1. Contact [Support](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink?LinkId=272975)
2. Choose "Seller Dashboard registration and your account"
3. Choose "Registering for a developer account"
4. Choose contact method

## B. Acquire an Azure "pay-as-you-go" Subscription

This is the subscription you will use to create your VM images and hand over the images to [Azure Marketplace](http://azure.microsoft.com/marketplace). If you do not have an existing subscription, then please sign up here, https://account.windowsazure.com/signup?offer=ms-azr-0003p

## C. Create an Azure compatible solution
1. Identifying topology and platform evaluation
  For each type of deployment - Evaluation, Proof of Concept, Dev/Test, and Production - think through the exact layout and topology needed for your application. Questions to ask:
  - What are the different tiers?
  - What resources are needed for each tier and of what size?
  - What are the building blocks needed to create these resources?
  A production deployment, or even a dev/test environment, can vary significantly in size depending on the customer and their needs. Decide upon what a small, medium, large, and extra-large topology would look like for your workload and think through availability, scalability, and performance requirements needed to be successful.
2. Familiarize yourself with Azure ARM Template
  The Azure Resource Manager deploys and manages the lifecycle of a collection of resources through declarative, model-based template language. This ARM template is simply a parameterized JSON file which expresses the set of resources and their relationship to be used for deployments. Each resource is placed in a resource group, which is simply a container for resources. ARM provides centralized auditing, tagging, Resource Based Access Control, and most importantly, its operations are idempotent.
  With ARM and ARM templates, you can express more complex deployments of Azure resources, such as Virtual Machines, Storage Accounts, and Virtual Networks, which build upon Marketplace content such as VM Images and VM Extensions.
3. Developing and testing the identified topology
  After identifying the topology, you need to work on the following:
  - Review the best practices for the Multi VM solutions (Please refer to the [Template Solutions in the Marketplace](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/AzureMarketplaceOnboarding/_layouts/15/start.aspx#/Onboarding%20Resources/Forms/AllItems.aspx?RootFolder=%2Fteams%2FAzureMarketplaceOnboarding%2FOnboarding%20Resources%2FMulti%20VM&FolderCTID=0x01200022453DD82E509544B11C9F5367F6105B&View=%7BEC6E631C%2DEFA1%2D4E67%2D87C6%2D4FCA489A2F92%7D&InitialTabId=Rib) for best practices).
  - Work on the configuration (VM sizes, Storage accounts, VNet, Subnet, Network interface card, public IP, etc.)
  - Set up dev and test environment
  - Build and iterate on the template
  - Perform rigorous stress testing and performance testing
  For detailed information on the guidance, best practices and requirements for Multi-VM solutions please refer to the document [Template Solutions in the Marketplace](https://microsoft.sharepoint.com/teams/AzureMarketplaceOnboarding/_layouts/15/start.aspx#/Onboarding%20Resources/Forms/AllItems.aspx?RootFolder=%2Fteams%2FAzureMarketplaceOnboarding%2FOnboarding%20Resources%2FMulti%20VM&FolderCTID=0x01200022453DD82E509544B11C9F5367F6105B&View=%7BEC6E631C%2DEFA1%2D4E67%2D87C6%2D4FCA489A2F92%7D&InitialTabId=Rib).

## Next Steps
Now that you reviewed the pre-requisites and completed the necessary tasks, you can move forward with the creating your Multi-VM Image Solution Template offer as detailed in the [Guide to creating a multi-vm image solution template](marketplace-publishing-solution-template-publication.md)
