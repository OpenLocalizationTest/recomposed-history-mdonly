# Portals used to create an offer on the Azure Marketplace

|Portal|Description|URL|Identity/Account|
|----|---|----|----|
|Seller Dashboard Portal | Creating your Seller Dashboard account is a one-time task. The partner should check to make sure the company does not already have a Seller Dashboard account before attempting to create one. During the process, we collect bank account information, tax information, and company address information.

Note - If you are publishing only free offers (or bring-your-own-license) we do not require tax and bank information. | [https://sellerdashboard.microsoft.com](https://sellerdashboard.microsoft.com) | Ideally a Distribution List or a Security Group
(e.g. azurepublishing@partnercompany.com)

This Distribution List or a Security Group **MUST** be registered as a Microsoft Account.

Note - We recommend using a Distribution List or a Security Group as it removes the dependency on any individual; although an individual account be used as well.|
|Publishing Portal | Portal for the partner to work on their offer and to publish it (marketing, pricing, publishing, certification if applicable, etc.). | [https://publish.windowsazure.com](https://publish.windowsazure.com) | Above **Distribution List** or a **Security Group** must be used for the first time to login on Publishing portal and later other users can be added as co-admin. This is how it gets mapped to the Seller Dashboard registration data.|
| Azure Preview Portal | This is the portal where the partners can view their Staged and Published offers in the Marketplace (applicable for VMs, solution templates and ARM-based Developer Services) | [https://ms.portal.azure.com](https://ms.portal.azure.com) | While staging the offer from publishing portal a subscription ID needs to be whitelisted. The same subscription[there is a username and password associated] needs to be used while logging in to this portal to test the staged offer.|
