# Seller Account Creation
### Create your Seller Dashboard account
The Microsoft Seller Dashboard is used to register the company information once. The registrant must be a valid representative of the company, and must provide their personal information as a way to validate their identity. The person registering must use a Microsoft account (MSA) that is shared for the company, and the same account must be used in the Azure Publishing Portal. You should check to make sure your company does not already have a Seller Dashboard account before attempting to create one. During the process, we will collect bank account information, tax information, and company address information. These are typically obtainable from finance or business contacts. For complete instructions on how to create a Seller Dashboard account, see [Create Your Account and Add Payout Information in the Microsoft][1].

#### Seller Dashboard
1. Go to the [Seller Dashboard][2]
2. Complete the "Help us protect your account" wizard, which will verify your identity via phone number or email address.
3. Go to Account Details. On this screen, you will enter your PERSONAL information, which is only used for identity verification. That means your name, email address, residential address, and personal phone number. This infomration is not shared with anyone outside of Microsoft.
4. Designate your account type as Company, NOT Individual. Click Next.
5. Fill out the Company details. This is the marketing profile for your company. When it is complete, click Submit for approval.
6. You must provide payout and tax information and submit it for validation. In roder to add payout and tax information, go to Account > Payout & Tax and click Add. Enter your company's information. You will be required to provide a Tax Identification Number and other tax information matching the country in which your business is headquartered.

Once you register your company, you can continue working in parallel while the verification of your registration is completed by the Seller Dashboard team. You can monitor the status of your approvals via the [Azure Publishing Portal][3].
