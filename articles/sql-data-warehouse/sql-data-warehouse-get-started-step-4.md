# Step 4: Create a User for SQL Data Warehouse

## Why create a separate user?

We will use the connection to the SQL Server (logical server) with server credentials from the previous step 
to create a new user for our SQL Data Warehouse. There are two primary reasons why you'll want to create a separate 
user/login for your SQL DW.

1.  Your organizationâ€™s users should use a different account to authenticate. 
This way you can limit the permissions granted to the application and reduce 
the risks of malicious activity in case your application code is vulnerable to a SQL injection attack.

2. By default, the server administrator login that you're currently connected with uses a smaller 
resource class. Resource classes help you control memory allocation and CPU cycles given to a query. 
Users in smallrc are given a smaller amount of memory and can take advantage of higher concurrency. 
In contrast, users assigned to xlargerc are given large amounts of memory, and therefore fewer of their queries can run concurrently. 
For loading data in a way that best optimizes compression, you'll want to make sure the user loading data 
is part of a larger resource class. Read more about resource classes [here](./sql-data-warehouse-develop-concurrency.md#resource-classes):

## Creating a user of a larger resource class

1. Create a new query on the **master** database of your server

2. Create a server login and user

```sql
CREATE LOGIN XLRCLOGIN WITH PASSWORD = 'a123reallySTRONGpassword!';
CREATE USER LoadingUser FOR LOGIN XLRCLOGIN;
```

3. Create a new database user based on the server login
```sql
CREATE USER LoadingUser FOR LOGIN XLRCLOGIN;
```

4. Grant user DB control
```sql
GRANT CONTROL ON DATABASE::[NYT] to LoadingUser;
```
> [!NOTE]
> If your database name has hyphens in it, be sure to wrap it in brackets! 
>

5. Add your database user to the xlargerc resource class role
```sql
EXEC sp_addrolememeber 'xlargerc', 'LoadingUser';
```

6. Login with your new login to your database
