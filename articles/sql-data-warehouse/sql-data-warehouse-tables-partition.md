## Partitioning SQL Data Warehouse Tables

Partitioning essentially divides it into multiple sections.  Primarily partitioning is used to improve performance of data maintenance through partition deletion, switching and merging.  Partitioning can also be use to improve query performance.  Partitioning is supported on all SQL Data Warehouse table types; including clustered columnstore, clustered index, and heap.  Also, all distribution strategies, whether hash or round robin distributed, also support partitioning.

SQL Data Warehouse uses a simplified definition of partitions which is slightly different from SQL Server.  Partitioning functions and schemes are not used.  Instead, all you need to do is identify partitioned column and the boundary points.

Example of SQL Data Warehouse partitioned `CREATE TABLE` command:

```sql
CREATE TABLE [dbo].[FactInternetSales]
(
    [ProductKey]            int          NOT NULL
,   [OrderDateKey]          int          NOT NULL
,   [CustomerKey]           int          NOT NULL
,   [PromotionKey]          int          NOT NULL
,   [SalesOrderNumber]      nvarchar(20) NOT NULL
,   [OrderQuantity]         smallint     NOT NULL
,   [UnitPrice]             money        NOT NULL
,   [SalesAmount]           money        NOT NULL
)
WITH
(   CLUSTERED COLUMNSTORE INDEX
,   DISTRIBUTION = HASH([ProductKey])
,   PARTITION   (   [OrderDateKey] RANGE RIGHT FOR VALUES
                    (20000101,20010101,20020101
                    ,20030101,20040101,20050101
                    )
                )
)
;
```

## Migrating SQL Server syntax to SQL Data Warehouse

To migrate SQL Server partition definitions to SQL Data Warehouse simply:

- Remove SQL Server partition functions and schemes since this is managed for you when you create the table.
- Define the partitions during CREATE TABLE. 
- Specify partition boundary points and whether you want the boundary point to be `RANGE RIGHT` or `RANGE LEFT`.

To learn more about partitions in SQL Server, see [Partitioned Tables and Indexes][].

## Partition sizing

While partitining can be used to improve performance in data maintenance and query scenarios, creating a table with too many partitions can actually hurt performance under some circumstances.  These concerns are especially true for clustered columnstore tables.  For partitioning to be helpful, it is important to understand when to use partitioning and the number of partitions to create.  These guidelines are intended to help you make the best choices for your scenarios.

## Partition strategies

Normally table partitions are useful in two primary ways:

1. Using partition switching to quickly truncate a section of a table.  A commonly used design is for a fact table to contain rows only for some predetermined finite period.  For example, a sales fact table might contain data only for the past 36 months.  At the end of every month, the oldest month of sales data is deleted from the table.  This could be accomplished by simply deleting all of the rows for the oldest month, but deleting a large amount of data row-by-row can take a very long time.  To optimize for this scenario, SQL DW supports partition swapping, which enables the entire set of rows in a partition to be dropped in a single fast operation.   

2. Partitioning enables queries to easily skip processing of large set of rows (i.e. a partition) if queries place a predicate on the partitioning column.  For example, if the sales fact table is partitioned into 36 months using the sales date field, then queries that filter on the sale date can skip processing partitions that donâ€™t match the filter.  In effect, partitioning used in this way is a coarse grained index.

When creating clustered columnstore tables in SQL Data Warehouse, you will need to consider an additional factor: number of rows.   Clustered columnstore tables can achieve a high degree of compression query performance when there are more rows per partition.  Due to how compression works internally in SQL Data Warehouse, each partition in a CCI table needs to have a fairly large number of rows before data is compressed. In addition, SQL Data Warehouse spreads data across a large number of distributions, and each distribution is further divided by partitions.  For optimal compression and performance, a minimum of 1 million rows per distribution and partition is needed.  Using the example above, if the sales fact table contained 36 monthly partitions, and given that SQL DW has 60 distributions, then the sales fact table should contain 60 million rows per month, or 2.1 billion rows when all months are populated.  If a table contains significantly less rows than the recommended minimum, then the consider using fewer partitions in order to make the number of rows per distribution larger.  

To size your current SQL Server database at the partition level use a query like the one below:

```sql
SELECT      s.[name]                        AS      [schema_name]
,           t.[name]                        AS      [table_name]
,           i.[name]                        AS      [index_name]
,           p.[partition_number]            AS      [partition_number]
,           SUM(a.[used_pages]*8.0)         AS      [partition_size_kb]
,           SUM(a.[used_pages]*8.0)/1024    AS      [partition_size_mb]
,           SUM(a.[used_pages]*8.0)/1048576 AS      [partition_size_gb]
,           p.[rows]                        AS      [partition_row_count]
,           rv.[value]                      AS      [partition_boundary_value]
,           p.[data_compression_desc]       AS      [partition_compression_desc]
FROM        sys.schemas s
JOIN        sys.tables t                    ON      t.[schema_id]         = s.[schema_id]
JOIN        sys.partitions p                ON      p.[object_id]         = t.[object_id]
JOIN        sys.allocation_units a          ON      a.[container_id]      = p.[partition_id]
JOIN        sys.indexes i                   ON      i.[object_id]         = p.[object_id]
                                            AND     i.[index_id]          = p.[index_id]
JOIN        sys.data_spaces ds              ON      ds.[data_space_id]    = i.[data_space_id]
LEFT JOIN   sys.partition_schemes ps        ON      ps.[data_space_id]    = ds.[data_space_id]
LEFT JOIN   sys.partition_functions pf      ON      pf.[function_id]      = ps.[function_id]
LEFT JOIN   sys.partition_range_values rv   ON      rv.[function_id]      = pf.[function_id]
                                            AND     rv.[boundary_id]      = p.[partition_number]
WHERE       p.[index_id] <=1
GROUP BY    s.[name]
,           t.[name]
,           i.[name]
,           p.[partition_number]
,           p.[rows]
,           rv.[value]
,           p.[data_compression_desc]
;
```

## Workload manangement

One final piece of information you need to factor in to the table partition decision is workload management. In SQL Data Warehouse the maximum memory allocated to each distribution during query execution is governed by this feature. Please refer to the following article for more details on [workload management][]. Ideally your partition will be sized with in-memory operations such as columnstore index rebuilds in mind. An index rebuild is a memory intensive operation, therefore you will want to ensure that the partition index rebuild is not starved of memory. Increasing the amount of memory available to your query can be achieved by switching from the default role to one of the other roles available.

Information on the allocation of memory per distribution is available by querying the resource governor dynamic management views. In reality your memory grant will be less than the figures below. However, this provides a level of guidance that you can use when sizing your partitions for data management operations.

```sql
SELECT  rp.[name]								AS [pool_name]
,       rp.[max_memory_kb]						AS [max_memory_kb]
,       rp.[max_memory_kb]/1024					AS [max_memory_mb]
,       rp.[max_memory_kb]/1048576				AS [mex_memory_gb]
,       rp.[max_memory_percent]					AS [max_memory_percent]
,       wg.[name]								AS [group_name]
,       wg.[importance]							AS [group_importance]
,       wg.[request_max_memory_grant_percent]	AS [request_max_memory_grant_percent]
FROM    sys.dm_pdw_nodes_resource_governor_workload_groups	wg
JOIN    sys.dm_pdw_nodes_resource_governor_resource_pools	rp ON wg.[pool_id] = rp.[pool_id]
WHERE   wg.[name] like 'SloDWGroup%'
AND     rp.[name]    = 'SloDWPool'
;
```

> [AZURE.NOTE] Try to avoid sizing your partitions beyond the memory grant provided by the extra large resource class. If your partitions grow beyond this figure you run the risk of memory pressure which in turn leads to less optimal compression.

## Partition switching

To switch partitions between two tables you must ensure that the partitions align on their respective boundaries and that the table definitions match. As check constraints are not available to enforce the range of values in a table the source table must contain the same partition boundaries as the target table. If this is not the case then the parition switch will fail as the partition metadata will not be synchronised.

### How to split a partition that contains data
The most efficient method to split a partition that already contains data is to use a `CTAS` statement. If the partitioned table is a clustered columnstore then the table partition must be empty before it can be split.

Below is a sample partitioned columnstore table containing one row in each partition:

```sql
CREATE TABLE [dbo].[FactInternetSales]
(
        [ProductKey]            int          NOT NULL
    ,   [OrderDateKey]          int          NOT NULL
    ,   [CustomerKey]           int          NOT NULL
    ,   [PromotionKey]          int          NOT NULL
    ,   [SalesOrderNumber]      nvarchar(20) NOT NULL
    ,   [OrderQuantity]         smallint     NOT NULL
    ,   [UnitPrice]             money        NOT NULL
    ,   [SalesAmount]           money        NOT NULL
)
WITH
(   CLUSTERED COLUMNSTORE INDEX
,   DISTRIBUTION = HASH([ProductKey])
,   PARTITION   (   [OrderDateKey] RANGE RIGHT FOR VALUES
                    (20000101
                    )
                )
)
;

INSERT INTO dbo.FactInternetSales
VALUES (1,19990101,1,1,1,1,1,1);
INSERT INTO dbo.FactInternetSales
VALUES (1,20000101,1,1,1,1,1,1);


CREATE STATISTICS Stat_dbo_FactInternetSales_OrderDateKey ON dbo.FactInternetSales(OrderDateKey);
```

> [AZURE.NOTE] By Creating the statistic object we ensure that table metadata is more accurate. If we omit creating statistics then SQL Data Warehouse will use default values. For details on statistics please review [statistics][].

We can then query for the row count leveraging the `sys.partitions` catalog view:

```sql
SELECT  QUOTENAME(s.[name])+'.'+QUOTENAME(t.[name]) as Table_name
,       i.[name] as Index_name
,       p.partition_number as Partition_nmbr
,       p.[rows] as Row_count
,       p.[data_compression_desc] as Data_Compression_desc
FROM    sys.partitions p
JOIN    sys.tables     t    ON    p.[object_id]   = t.[object_id]
JOIN    sys.schemas    s    ON    t.[schema_id]   = s.[schema_id]
JOIN    sys.indexes    i    ON    p.[object_id]   = i.[object_Id]
                            AND   p.[index_Id]    = i.[index_Id]
WHERE t.[name] = 'FactInternetSales'
;
```

If we try to split this table we will get an error:

```sql
ALTER TABLE FactInternetSales SPLIT RANGE (20010101);
```

Msg 35346, Level 15, State 1, Line 44
SPLIT clause of ALTER PARTITION statement failed because the partition is not empty.  Only empty partitions can be split in when a columnstore index exists on the table. Consider disabling the columnstore index before issuing the ALTER PARTITION statement, then rebuilding the columnstore index after ALTER PARTITION is complete.

However we can use `CTAS` to create a new table to hold our data.

```sql
CREATE TABLE dbo.FactInternetSales_20000101
    WITH    (   DISTRIBUTION = HASH(ProductKey)
            ,   CLUSTERED COLUMNSTORE INDEX
            ,   PARTITION   (   [OrderDateKey] RANGE RIGHT FOR VALUES
                                (20000101
                                )
                            )
            )
AS
SELECT *
FROM    FactInternetSales
WHERE   1=2
;
```

As the partition boundaries are aligned a switch is permitted. This will leave the source table with an empty partition that we can subsequently split.

```sql
ALTER TABLE FactInternetSales SWITCH PARTITION 2 TO  FactInternetSales_20000101 PARTITION 2;

ALTER TABLE FactInternetSales SPLIT RANGE (20010101);
```

All that is left to do is to align our data to the new partition boundaries using `CTAS` and switch our data back in to the main table

```sql
CREATE TABLE [dbo].[FactInternetSales_20000101_20010101]
    WITH    (   DISTRIBUTION = HASH([ProductKey])
            ,   CLUSTERED COLUMNSTORE INDEX
            ,   PARTITION   (   [OrderDateKey] RANGE RIGHT FOR VALUES
                                (20000101,20010101
                                )
                            )
            )
AS
SELECT  *
FROM    [dbo].[FactInternetSales_20000101]
WHERE   [OrderDateKey] >= 20000101
AND     [OrderDateKey] <  20010101
;

ALTER TABLE dbo.FactInternetSales_20000101_20010101 SWITCH PARTITION 2 TO dbo.FactInternetSales PARTITION 2;
```

Once you have completed the movement of the data it is a good idea to refresh the statistics on the target table to ensure they accurately reflect the new distribution of the data in their respective partitions:

```sql
UPDATE STATISTICS [dbo].[FactInternetSales];
```

### Table partitioning source control

To avoid your table definition from **rusting** in your source control system you may want to consider the following approach:

1. Create the table as a partitioned table but with no partition values

```sql
CREATE TABLE [dbo].[FactInternetSales]
(
    [ProductKey]            int          NOT NULL
,   [OrderDateKey]          int          NOT NULL
,   [CustomerKey]           int          NOT NULL
,   [PromotionKey]          int          NOT NULL
,   [SalesOrderNumber]      nvarchar(20) NOT NULL
,   [OrderQuantity]         smallint     NOT NULL
,   [UnitPrice]             money        NOT NULL
,   [SalesAmount]           money        NOT NULL
)
WITH
(   CLUSTERED COLUMNSTORE INDEX
,   DISTRIBUTION = HASH([ProductKey])
,   PARTITION   (   [OrderDateKey] RANGE RIGHT FOR VALUES
                    ()
                )
)
;
```

2. `SPLIT` the table as part of the deployment process:

```sql
-- Create a table containing the partition boundaries

CREATE TABLE #partitions
WITH
(
    LOCATION = USER_DB
,   DISTRIBUTION = HASH(ptn_no)
)
AS
SELECT  ptn_no
,       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY (ptn_no)) as seq_no
FROM    (
        SELECT CAST(20000101 AS INT) ptn_no
        UNION ALL
        SELECT CAST(20010101 AS INT)
        UNION ALL
        SELECT CAST(20020101 AS INT)
        UNION ALL
        SELECT CAST(20030101 AS INT)
        UNION ALL
        SELECT CAST(20040101 AS INT)
        ) a
;

-- Iterate over the partition boundaries and split the table

DECLARE @c INT = (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM #partitions)
,       @i INT = 1                                 --iterator for while loop
,       @q NVARCHAR(4000)                          --query
,       @p NVARCHAR(20)     = N''                  --partition_number
,       @s NVARCHAR(128)    = N'dbo'               --schema
,       @t NVARCHAR(128)    = N'FactInternetSales' --table
;

WHILE @i <= @c
BEGIN
    SET @p = (SELECT ptn_no FROM #partitions WHERE seq_no = @i);
    SET @q = (SELECT N'ALTER TABLE '+@s+N'.'+@t+N' SPLIT RANGE ('+@p+N');');

    -- PRINT @q;
    EXECUTE sp_executesql @q;

    SET @i+=1;
END

-- Code clean-up

DROP TABLE #partitions;
```

With this approach the code in source control remains static and the partitioning boundary values are allowed to be dynamic; evolving with the warehouse over time.
