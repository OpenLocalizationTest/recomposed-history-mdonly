# Concurrency and workload management in SQL Data Warehouse

To deliver predictable performance at scale SQL Data Warehouse allows users to control concurrency levels as well as resource allocations like memory.  This article introduces you to the concepts of concurrency and workload management, explaining how both features have been implemented and how you can control them in your data warehouse.

>[AZURE.NOTE] SQL Data Warehouse supports multi-user, not multi-tenant workloads.

## Concurrency limits

SQL Data Warehouse allows up to 1,024 conncurrent connections.  All 1,024 connections to the SQL Data Warehouse can submit queries concurrently.  However, in order to optimize throughput, SQL Data Warehouse may queue some queries.  This queuing is in large part a mechanism ensure each query recieves a minimal memory grant which in turn ensures that each query can execute optimally and thus maximizes total throughput.  Both the currency level and memory grant are controllable by assigning users to a **resource class**.  Simply put, resource classes range from smallrc to xlargerc, where users in smallrc are given a smaller amount of memory and thus allow for higher concurrency and in contrast, users assigned to xlargerc are given large amounts of memory and therefore less of these queries are allowed to run concurrently.

Concurrent queries are governed by two concepts, **concurrent queries** and **concurrency slots**.

**Concurrent queries** is the number of queries executing at the same time. SQL Data Warehouse supports up to 32 **concurrent queries** on the larger DW sizes, DW1000 and above.  

**Concurrency slots** is a more dynamic concept.  Each concurrently executing query consumes one or more concurrency slots. The exact number of slots depends on three factors:

	1. The DWU setting for the SQL Data Warehouse (e.g. DW400)
	2. The **resource class** that the user belongs to (e.g. smallrc)
	3. Whether the query or operation is governed by the concurrency slot model (see [resource class exceptions](#exceptions))

This table describes the limits for both concurrent queries and concurrency slots.

**Concurrency Limits**

|                              | DW100 | DW200 | DW300 | DW400 | DW500 | DW600 | DW1000 | DW1200 | DW1500 | DW2000 | DW3000 | DW6000 |
| :--------------------------- | ----: | ----: | ----: | ----: | ----: | ----: | -----: | -----: | -----: | -----: | -----: | -----: |
| Max Concurrent Queries       | 32    | 32    | 32    | 32    | 32    | 32    | 32     | 32     | 32     | 32     | 32     | 32     |
| Max Concurrency Slots        | 4     | 8     | 12    | 16    | 20    | 24    | 40     | 48     | 60     | 80     | 120    | 240    |

SQL Data Warehouse query workloads have to live within these thresholds. If there are more than 32 concurrent queries **or** you exceed the number of concurrency slots then the query will be queued until **both** thresholds can be satisfied.  There are a few types of queries which ignore these rules.  Generally speaking, these are queries which do not require any substaintial memory to execute.  You can find these execeptions later on in this article.

## Resource classes

SQL Data Warehouse workload management exposes four resource classes in the form of **database roles**;  **smallrc, mediumrc, largerc, and xlargerc**.  Resource classes are an essential part of SQL Data Warehouse workload management as they allow more memory and or CPU cycles to be allocated to queries run by a given user.

By default each user is a member of the small resource class, smallrc.  The procedure `sp_addrolemember` is used to increase the resource class and `sp_droprolemember` is used to decrease the resource class.  For example, this command would increase the resource class of the loaduser to largerc

```sql
EXEC sp_addrolemember 'largerc', 'loaduser'
```

`ALTER ROLE` permission is required to change the resource class of a user.  While a user can be added to one or more of the higher resource classes.  Users will take on the attributes of the highest resource class to which they are assigned.  **The resource class of the sa user cannot be changed.**  More details for create logins and users is provided in the [managing users)[#managing-users] section at the end of this article.

> [AZURE.NOTE] A good practice is to create users which are permenantly assigned to a resource class rather than changing the resource class of a user.  For example, it's often a best practice to ensure loads to clustered column store tables have more memory so that they can create higher performing indexes.  A good practices is to create a load user in a higher resource class. 

## Memory allocation

There are pros and cons to increasing a user's resource class.  While increasing a resource class for a user may mean their queries execute faster, it also reduces the number of concurrent queries that can run.  This is a result of memory being divided between users.  If one user is given more memory for a query, other users will not have memory available to them to run a query.

The following table maps the increase in memory available to **the queries on each distribution** by DWU and resource class.  In other words, since there are 60 distributions per database, a query which would benfit from a large memory allocation would have access to about 375 GB of memory if the user was in xlargerc and running on a DW2000 (6,400 MB * 60 distributions / 1,024 to convert to GB).

**Memory Allocated per Distribution (MB)**

|                | DW100 | DW200 | DW300 | DW400 | DW500 | DW600 | DW1000 | DW1200 | DW1500 | DW2000 | DW3000 | DW6000 |
| :------------- | ----: | ----: | ----: | ----: | ----: | ----: | -----: | -----: | -----: | -----: | -----: | -----: |
| smallrc        |   100 |   100 |   100 |   100 |   100 |   100 |    100 |    100 |    100 |    100 |    100 |    100 |
| mediumrc       |   100 |   200 |   200 |   400 |   400 |   400 |    800 |    800 |    800 |  1,600 |  1,600 |  3,200 |
| largerc        |   200 |   400 |   400 |   800 |   800 |   800 |  1,600 |  1,600 |  1,600 |  3,200 |  3,200 |  6,400 |
| xlargerc       |   400 |   800 |   800 | 1,600 | 1,600 | 1,600 |  3,200 |  3,200 |  3,200 |  6,400 |  6,400 | 12,800 |

## Concurrency slot consumption

As mentioned above, the higher the resource class the more memory granted.  Since memory is a fixed resource, the more memory allocated per query, the less concurrency which can be supported.  The following table reiterates the number of concurrency slots available by DWU as well as the slots consumed by each resource class.

**Allocation and Consumption of Concurrency Slots**

|                         | DW100 | DW200 | DW300 | DW400 | DW500 | DW600 | DW1000 | DW1200 | DW1500 | DW2000 | DW3000 | DW6000 |
| :---------------------- | ----: | ----: | ----: | ----: | ----: | ----: | -----: | -----: | -----: | -----: | -----: | -----: |
| **Allocation**          |       |       |       |       |       |       |        |        |        |        |        |        |
| Max Concurrent Queries  | 32    | 32    | 32    | 32    | 32    | 32    | 32     | 32     | 32     | 32     | 32     | 32     |
| Max Concurrency Slots   | 4     | 8     | 12    | 16    | 20    | 24    | 40     | 48     | 60     | 80     | 80     | 80     |
| **Slot Consumption**    |       |       |       |       |       |       |        |        |        |        |        |        |
| smallrc                 | 1     | 1     | 1     | 1     | 1     | 1     | 1      | 1      | 1      | 1      | 1      | 1      |
| mediumrc                | 1     | 2     | 2     | 4     | 4     | 4     | 8      | 8      | 8      | 16     | 16     | 32     |
| largerc                 | 2     | 4     | 4     | 8     | 8     | 8     | 16     | 16     | 16     | 32     | 32     | 64     |
| xlargerc                | 4     | 8     | 8     | 16    | 16    | 16    | 32     | 32     | 32     | 64     | 64     | 128    |

## Importance

Under the covers there are a total of eight workload groups which control the behavior of resource classes.  However, only four of the eight workload groups are used for any given DWU.  This makes sense since each workload group is assigned to either smallrc, mediumrc, largerc, or xlargerc.  What makes this aspect important to understand is that each workload group is also assigned a resource governor **IMPORTANCE**.  Importance is used for CPU scheduling.  Queries run with high importance will get 3X more CPU cycles than those with medium importance.  So concurrency slot mappings also determine CPU importance.  When a query is consumes 16 or more slots, it runs as high importance.

**Workload Groups**

|                | Concurrency Slot Mapping | Importance Mapping |
| :------------  | -----------------------: | :----------------- |
| SloDWGroupC00  | 1                        | Medium             |
| SloDWGroupC01  | 2                        | Medium             |
| SloDWGroupC02  | 4                        | Medium             |
| SloDWGroupC03  | 8                        | Medium             |
| SloDWGroupC04  | 16                       | High               |
| SloDWGroupC05  | 32                       | High               |
| SloDWGroupC06  | 64                       | High               |
| SloDWGroupC07  | 128                      | High               |

For example, for a DW500 SQL Data Warehouse, the active workload groups would be mapped to the resource classes as follows:

|                | Workload Group | Concurrency Slots Used   | Importance |
| :------------- | :------------- | ---------------------:   | :--------- |
| smallrc        | SloDWGroupC00  | 1                        | Medium     |
| mediumrc       | SloDWGroupC02  | 4                        | Medium     |
| largerc        | SloDWGroupC03  | 8                        | Medium     |
| xlargerc       | SloDWGroupC04  | 16                       | High       |


To look at the differences in memory resource allocation in detail from the perspective of the resource governor use the following query:

```sql
WITH rg
AS
(   SELECT  
     pn.name						AS node_name
    ,pn.[type]						AS node_type
    ,pn.pdw_node_id					AS node_id
    ,rp.name						AS pool_name
    ,rp.max_memory_kb*1.0/1024				AS pool_max_mem_MB
    ,wg.name						AS group_name
    ,wg.importance					AS group_importance
    ,wg.request_max_memory_grant_percent		AS group_request_max_memory_grant_pcnt
    ,wg.max_dop						AS group_max_dop
    ,wg.effective_max_dop				AS group_effective_max_dop
    ,wg.total_request_count				AS group_total_request_count
    ,wg.total_queued_request_count			AS group_total_queued_request_count
    ,wg.active_request_count				AS group_active_request_count
    ,wg.queued_request_count				AS group_queued_request_count
    FROM    sys.dm_pdw_nodes_resource_governor_workload_groups wg
    JOIN    sys.dm_pdw_nodes_resource_governor_resource_pools rp    
            ON  wg.pdw_node_id  = rp.pdw_node_id
    	    AND wg.pool_id      = rp.pool_id
    JOIN    sys.dm_pdw_nodes pn	
            ON	wg.pdw_node_id	= pn.pdw_node_id
    WHERE   wg.name like 'SloDWGroup%'
        AND     rp.name = 'SloDWPool'
)
SELECT	pool_name
,		pool_max_mem_MB
,		group_name
,		group_importance
,		(pool_max_mem_MB/100)*group_request_max_memory_grant_pcnt AS max_memory_grant_MB
,		node_name
,		node_type
,       group_total_request_count
,       group_total_queued_request_count
,       group_active_request_count
,       group_queued_request_count
FROM	rg
ORDER BY
	node_name
,	group_request_max_memory_grant_pcnt
,	group_importance
;
```

### Exceptions

Most queries honor resource classes, however, there are some exceptions.  Typically, this occurs when the resources required to fulfil the action are low.  That is, the exceptions are generally cases where a query will never utilize the higher memory allocated by higher resource classes.  In these cases the default or small resource class (smallrc) is always used regardless of the resource class assigned to the user. For example, `CREATE LOGIN` will always run in the smallrc. The resources required to fulfil this operation are very low and so it would not make sense to include the query in the concurrency slot model. It would be wasteful to pre-allocate large amounts of memory for this action. By excluding `CREATE LOGIN` from the concurrency slot model SQL Data Warehouse can be much more efficient.  

The following statements **do not** honor resource classes:

- CREATE or DROP TABLE
- ALTER TABLE ... SWITCH, SPLIT or MERGE PARTITION
- ALTER INDEX DISABLE
- DROP INDEX
- CREATE, UPDATE or DROP STATISTICS
- TRUNCATE TABLE
- ALTER AUTHORIZATION
- CREATE LOGIN
- CREATE, ALTER or DROP USER
- CREATE, ALTER or DROP PROCEDURE
- CREATE or DROP VIEW
- INSERT VALUES
- SELECT from system views and DMVs
- EXPLAIN
- DBCC

<!--
Removed as these two are not confirmed / supported under SQLDW
- CREATE REMOTE TABLE AS SELECT
- CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE AS SELECT
- REDISTRIBUTE
-->

> [AZURE.NOTE] `SELECT` queries executing exclusively against dynamic management views (DMVs) and catalog views are **not** governed by resource classes.  This allows users to monitor the system even when all concurrency slots are in use.

### Queries which honor concurrency limits

It is important to remember that the majority of end user queries are likely to be governed by resource classes. The general rule is that the active query workload must fit inside both the concurrent query and concurrency slot thresholds unless it has been specifically excluded by the platform. As an end user you cannot choose to exclude a query from the concurrency slot model. Once either threshold has been exceeded queries will begin to queue. Queued queries will be addressed in priority order followed by submission time.

To reiterate, the following statements do **honor** resource classes:

- INSERT-SELECT
- UPDATE
- DELETE
- SELECT (when querying user tables)
- ALTER INDEX REBUILD
- ALTER INDEX REORGANIZE
- ALTER TABLE REBUILD
- CREATE INDEX
- CREATE CLUSTERED COLUMNSTORE INDEX
- CREATE TABLE AS SELECT
- Data loading
- Data movement operations conducted by the Data Movement Service (DMS)


## Managing users

To grant access to a user to the SQL Data Warehouse they will first need a login.

Open a connection to the **master** database for your SQL Data Warehouse and execute the following commands:

```sql
CREATE LOGIN newperson WITH PASSWORD = 'mypassword'

CREATE USER newperson for LOGIN newperson
```

> [AZURE.NOTE] It is a good idea to create users for logins in the master database in Azure SQL database and Azure SQL Data Warehouse. There are two server roles available at this level that require the login to have a user in master in order to grant membership. The roles are `Loginmanager` and `dbmanager`. In both Azure SQL database and SQL Data Warehouse these roles grant rights to manage logins and to create databases. This is different to SQL Server. For more details please refer to the [Managing Databases and Logins in Azure SQL Database] article for more details.

Once the login has been created then a user account now needs to be added.

Open a connection to the **SQL Data Warehouse database** and execute the following command:

```sql
CREATE USER newperson FOR LOGIN newperson
```

Once complete permissions will need to be granted to the user. The example below grants `CONTROL` on the SQL Data Warehouse database. `CONTROL` at the database level is the equivalent of db_owner in SQL Server.

```sql
GRANT CONTROL ON DATABASE::MySQLDW to newperson
```

To see the workload management roles use the following query:

```sql
SELECT  ro.[name]           AS [db_role_name]
FROM    sys.database_principals ro
WHERE   ro.[type_desc]      = 'DATABASE_ROLE'
AND     ro.[is_fixed_role]  = 0
;
```

To add a user to an increase workload management role use the following query:

```sql
EXEC sp_addrolemember 'largerc', 'newperson'
```

To remove a user from an workload management role use the following query:

```sql
EXEC sp_droprolemember 'largerc', 'newperson'
```

> [AZURE.NOTE] It is not possible to remove a user from the smallrc.

To see which users are members of a given role use the following query:

```sql
SELECT	r.name AS role_principal_name
,		m.name AS member_principal_name
FROM	sys.database_role_members rm
JOIN	sys.database_principals AS r			ON rm.role_principal_id		= r.principal_id
JOIN	sys.database_principals AS m			ON rm.member_principal_id	= m.principal_id
WHERE	r.name IN ('mediumrc','largerc', 'xlargerc')
;
```

## Queued query detection
To identify queries that are held in a concurrency queue you can always refer to the `sys.dm_pdw_exec_requests` DMV.

```sql
SELECT 	 r.[request_id]									AS Request_ID
		,r.[status]										AS Request_Status
		,r.[submit_time]								AS Request_SubmitTime
		,r.[start_time]									AS Request_StartTime
        ,DATEDIFF(ms,[submit_time],[start_time])		AS Request_InitiateDuration_ms
        ,r.resource_class                               AS Request_resource_class
FROM    sys.dm_pdw_exec_requests r
;
```

SQL Data Warehouse has specific wait types for measuring concurrency.

They are:

- LocalQueriesConcurrencyResourceType
- UserConcurrencyResourceType
- DmsConcurrencyResourceType
- BackupConcurrencyResourceType

The LocalQueriesConcurrencyResourceType refers to queries that sit outside of the concurrency slot framework. DMV queries and system functions such as `SELECT @@VERSION` are examples of local queries.

The UserConcurrencyResourceType refers to queries that sit inside the concurrency slot framework. Queries against end user tables represent examples which would use this resource type.

The DmsConcurrencyResourceType refers to waits resulting from data movement operations.

The BackupConcurrencyResourceType can be seen when a database is being backed up. The maximum value for this resource type is 1. If multiple backups have been requested at the same time the others will queue.


To perform analysis of currently queued queries to find out what resources a request is waiting for please refer to the `sys.dm_pdw_waits` DMV.

```sql
SELECT  w.[wait_id]
,       w.[session_id]
,       w.[type]											AS Wait_type
,       w.[object_type]
,       w.[object_name]
,       w.[request_id]
,       w.[request_time]
,       w.[acquire_time]
,       w.[state]
,       w.[priority]
,		SESSION_ID()										AS Current_session
,		s.[status]											AS Session_status
,		s.[login_name]
,		s.[query_count]
,		s.[client_id]
,		s.[sql_spid]
,		r.[command]											AS Request_command
,		r.[label]
,		r.[status]											AS Request_status
,		r.[submit_time]
,		r.[start_time]
,		r.[end_compile_time]
,		r.[end_time]
,		DATEDIFF(ms,r.[submit_time],r.[start_time])			AS Request_queue_time_ms
,		DATEDIFF(ms,r.[start_time],r.[end_compile_time])	AS Request_compile_time_ms
,		DATEDIFF(ms,r.[end_compile_time],r.[end_time])		AS Request_execution_time_ms
,		r.[total_elapsed_time]
FROM    sys.dm_pdw_waits w
JOIN    sys.dm_pdw_exec_sessions s  ON w.[session_id] = s.[session_id]
JOIN    sys.dm_pdw_exec_requests r  ON w.[request_id] = r.[request_id]
WHERE	w.[session_id] <> SESSION_ID()
;
```

To view just the resource waits consumed by a given query you can refer to the `sys.dm_pdw_resource_waits` DMV. Resource wait time only measures the time waiting for resources to be provided as opposed to signal wait time which is the time it takes for the underlying SQL Server's to schedule the query onto the CPU.

```sql
SELECT  [session_id]
,       [type]
,       [object_type]
,       [object_name]
,       [request_id]
,       [request_time]
,       [acquire_time]
,       DATEDIFF(ms,[request_time],[acquire_time])  AS acquire_duration_ms
,       [concurrency_slots_used]                    AS concurrency_slots_reserved
,       [resource_class]
,       [wait_id]                                   AS queue_position
FROM    sys.dm_pdw_resource_waits
WHERE	[session_id] <> SESSION_ID()
;
```

Finally, for historic trend analysis of waits then SQL Datawarehouse provides the `sys.dm_pdw_wait_stats` DMV.

```sql
SELECT	w.[pdw_node_id]
,		w.[wait_name]
,		w.[max_wait_time]
,		w.[request_count]
,		w.[signal_time]
,		w.[completed_count]
,		w.[wait_time]
FROM	sys.dm_pdw_wait_stats w
;
```
