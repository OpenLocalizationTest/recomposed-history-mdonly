## Optimizing large index rebuilds

If you have a large table you can optimize your index rebuild in one of two ways:

1) Partition your table and execute partition level index rebuilds
2) Use CTAS to re-create the partition of data in a new table; and partition switch in the new table

### Partitioned index rebuild example

Below is an example of how to rebuild a single partition:

```
ALTER INDEX ALL ON [dbo].[FactInternetSales] REBUILD Partition = 5
```

ALTER INDEX..REBUILD is best used for smaller data volumes - especially against columnstore indexes. It guarantees that open rowgroups in the columnstore are closed and merged into columnstore index in the compressed format. However, if the partition is quite large then you will find that `CTAS` is the more efficient operation.

Refer to the [ALTER INDEX][] article for more details on this syntax.

### Using CTAS to rebuild a partition

Below is an example of how to rebuild a partition using CTAS:

```
-- Step 01. Select the partition of data and write it out to a new table using CTAS
CREATE TABLE [dbo].[FactInternetSales_20000101_20010101]
    WITH    (   DISTRIBUTION = HASH([ProductKey])
            ,   CLUSTERED COLUMNSTORE INDEX
            ,   PARTITION   (   [OrderDateKey] RANGE RIGHT FOR VALUES
                                (20000101,20010101
                                )
                            )
            )
AS
SELECT  *
FROM    [dbo].[FactInternetSales]
WHERE   [OrderDateKey] >= 20000101
AND     [OrderDateKey] <  20010101
;

-- Step 02. Create a SWITCH out table
 
CREATE TABLE dbo.FactInternetSales_20000101
    WITH    (   DISTRIBUTION = HASH(ProductKey)
            ,   CLUSTERED COLUMNSTORE INDEX
            ,   PARTITION   (   [OrderDateKey] RANGE RIGHT FOR VALUES
                                (20000101
                                )
                            )
            )
AS
SELECT *
FROM    [dbo].[FactInternetSales]
WHERE   1=2 -- Note this table will be empty

-- Step 03. Switch OUT the data 
ALTER TABLE [dbo].[FactInternetSales] SWITCH PARTITION 2 TO  [dbo].[FactInternetSales_20000101] PARTITION 2;

-- Step 04. Switch IN the rebuilt data
ALTER TABLE [dbo].[FactInternetSales_20000101_20010101] SWITCH PARTITION 2 TO  [dbo].[FactInternetSales] PARTITION 2;

```

Please refer to the article on [table partitioning][] for more guidance on how to create and size partitions. The article also contains an example to help identify partition boundaries.
