# Welcome to the Windows Azure content repo!

This repo contains the source content for the [Develop](http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/develop/overview/) and [Manage](http://www.windowsazure.com/en-us/manage/) sections of [WindowsAzure.com](http://www.windowsazure.com).  

If you just want to read the documentation, we recommend visiting [WindowsAzure.com](http://www.windowsazure.com)--the content there is updated weekly, and the site provides a much richer reading experience than what you'll get from reading our Markdown files on GitHub.

If you want to contribute to the Windows Azure content, you've come to the right place!  

*  Use the [Issues](http://github.com/WindowsAzure/azure-content/issues) section to file bugs or make suggestions about existing content or content you would like to see.
*  Fork the repo to start working on your own content updates.  Within the next few weeks, we'll be rolling out a contributor's agreement that will allow us to accept contributions from non-Microsoft contributors. We'll also be adding editorial guidelines and process details to provide more information about our publishing pipeline and editorial standards.

## Content structure

The [Folder Structure of the Repository](http://github.com/WindowsAzure/azure-content/tree/master/GettingStarted#folder-structure-of-the-repository) section in our [Getting Started guide](http://github.com/WindowsAzure/azure-content/tree/master/GettingStarted) provides an overview of the repo structure. 

## Production vs. in-progress content

Because this GitHub repo is the source that the majority of our writers are working against, you'll  see the the the repo includes unreleased content that is in various states of completion.  Because of this, you shouldn't assume that articles in the repo are complete, accurate, or demonstrative of best practices.  Instead, [WindowsAzure.com](http://www.windowsazure.com) should be your destination-of-choice for released content that has been tech reviewed, edited, and is considered ready for consumption.
