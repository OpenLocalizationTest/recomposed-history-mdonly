Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/Azure/azure-content-pr into elasticfix

# Please enter a commit message to explain why this merge is necessary,
# especially if it merges an updated upstream into a topic branch.
#
#Lines starting with '#' will be ignored, and an empty message aborts
# the commit.
