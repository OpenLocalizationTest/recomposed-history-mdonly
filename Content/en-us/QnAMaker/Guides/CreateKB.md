# Create your knowledge base #
Creating your knowledge base is as simple as pointing the tool to the existing content, and ingesting the QnA content.

Currently the tool can auto-extract question and answer pairs from most FAQ URLs and documents. If we are not able auto-extract, there is an option to editorially add QnA pairs later.

Follow the below steps to create a new KB.
## Step 1 - Click on Create new service
